#
#mysql - the mysql daemon, i.e, the mysql server.
#
#mysqld_safe - A server startup script. mysqld_safe attempts to start mysqld.
#
#mysql.server - A server startup script. Used on systems that use System V-style run directories containing
#scripts that start system services for particular run levels. It invokes the mysqld_safe to start the MySQL Server.
#
#mysqld_multi - A server startup script that can start or stop multiple servers installed on the system.

#comp_err - Used during the MySQL build/installation process. Compiles error messages files from the error source files.

#mysql_secure_installation - Enables to improve the security of your MySQL installation.

#mysql_ssl_rsa_setup - creates the SSL cert and key files and RSA key-pair files required to support secure connections, if those
#files are missing. Files created by mysql_ssl_rsa_setup can be used for secure connections using SSL or RSA.

#mysql_tzinfo_to_sql - This program loads the time zone tables in the mysql db using the contents of the host system zoneinfo db
# (This is a set of files that describes time zones)

#mysql_upgrade - Used after a MySQL upgrade operation. Checks tables for incompatibilies and repairs them if nessecary, and updates
#the grant tables with any changes relevant in newer versionings of MySQL.

#The following is the client programs that connect to the MySQL server:

#mysql - cmd line tool for interactively entering SQL statements or executing them from a file in batch mode.

#mysqladmin - A client that performs administrative operations, such as creating or dropping DBs, reloading the grant tables,
#flushing tables to disk and reopening log files.
#
#mysqladmin can also be used to retrieve version, process and status information from the server. 

#mysqlcheck - A table-maintenance client that checks, repairs and analyzes and optimizes tables.

#mysqldump - A client that dumps a MySQL db into a file as SQL,text, or XML.

#mysqlimport - A client that imports text files into their respective tables using LOAD DATA INFILE.

#mysqlpump - a client that dumps a MySQL db into a file as SQL.

#mysqlsh - MySQL Shell is a code editor for MySQL server. Allows for scripting of JS and Python.

#mysqlshow - A client that displays information about DBs, tables, columns and indexes.

#mysqlslap - A client made to emulate client load for a MySQL server and report the timing of each stage.
#Works as if multiple clients are accessing the server.

#There are a few MySQL Administrative and utility sectioned programs as well
#
#innochecksum - a offline InnoDB offline checksum utility.

#myisam_ftdump - A utility that displays information about full-text indexes in MyISAM tables.

#myisamchk - A utility to describe, check and optimize/repair MyISAM tables.

#myisamlog - A utility that processes the contents of a MyISAM log file.

#myisampack - A utiliy that compresses MyISAM tables to produce smaller read-only tables.

#mysql_config_editor - A utility that enables you to store authentication credentials in a secure, encrypted login path file
#named .mylogin.cnf

#mysqlbinlog - A utility for reading statements from a binary log. The log of executed statements contained in the binary log files
#can be used to help recover from a crash.

#mysqldumpslow - A utility to read and summarize the contents of a slow query log.

#Past this, there are MySQL program-development utilities.

#mysql_config - A shell script that produces the option values needed when compiling MySQL programs.

#my_print_defaults - A utility that shows which options are present in option groups of option files.

#resolve_stack_dump - A utility program that resolves a numeric stack trace dump to symbols.

#There are some misc. utilities:

#lz4_decompress - A utility that decompresses mysqlpump output that was created using LZ4 compression.

#perror - A utility that displays the meaning of system or MySQL error codes.

#resolveip - A utility program that resolves a host name to an IP address or vice versa.

#zlib_decompress - Utility that decompresses mysqlpump output that was created using ZLIB compression.

#Some of the ENvironment variables used by MySQL are as follows:

#MYSQL_UNIX_PORT - The default Unix socket file, used for connections to localhost

#MYSQL_TCP_PORT - The default port number, used for TCP/IP connections

#MYSQL_PWD - The default PW

#MYSQL_DEBUG - Debug trace options when debugging

#TMPDIR - The dir where temporary tables and files are created.

#Past this, there is the interaction of actually interacting with MySQL from the Commandline

#mysql --user=root test 
#
#Harkening back unto Unix systems, -- denotes commands, - denotes unix options
#test is a DB name, in this instnace

#most common operations shorthand to the first letter of the naming to denote command interaction
#--host/-h - Host
#--user/-u - User
#--password/-p - Password
#
#--port/-P - Port number to connect to
#--socket/-S - Specify a UNIX socket file on Unix (named Pipe name on Windows)

#To circumvent full need of explicit path denotation in parameter accessing, we can include the installation Path
#in the PATH setup.
#
#Meaning, if Mysql is installed to /usr/local/mysql/bin - we can put that into PATH, allowing us to simply denote it as 
#mysql
#
#Generally the runtime path declaration resolves to a local handle in terms of the bin designation path
#as in, just refering to bin with resolve it to a local designation path for MySQL.
#
#This can be important as well in terms of recursive path resolution, as this can come to be bugged.

#The following pertains to connecting to a MySQL Server
#
# There are a number of default parameter handligns to fallback unto, in terms of how MySQL operates.
#This means that if you just write for instance MySQL in the cmd, it will resolve to the default resolution
#of certain program variables:

#default host name: localhost
#
#default user name: ODBC on Windows, Unix login name on UNIX.
#
#if neither -p or --password is given, password is given as empty field
#
#default name of db to access: the first non option parameter found. If none, it does not select one

#Example of showcasing of accessing
#
# mysql --host=localhost --user=myname --password=password mydb
# mysql -h localhost -u myname -ppassword mydb

#note, no space between -p or --password command and actual PW.

#Other users on the system can see the pw entered on cmd line with ps auxw.

#To avoid security risks in that department, simply omit writing the pw on the cmd line
#
# mysql --host=localhost --user=myname --password mydb
# mysql -h localhost -u myname -p mydb

# The above examples has omitted PW on the CMDline.

#Some systems limit the PW to 8 chars. Either have the PW as 8 chars, or put it as a value in a option file

#On Unix systems, localhost attempts to ordane connection through a UNix Socket. 
#To circumvent this, use explicit IP declaration
#
# mysql --host=127.0.0.1
# mysql --protocol=TCP Allows us to denote different connection types, even if it would default ot something else

#If the server is made to accept Ipv6 connections, clients can connect with --host=::1

#On windows, we can force named-pipe connections by specifying the --pipe or --protocol=PIPE option, or by using
#. as the hostname

#If named-pipe connections are not enabled, an error occurs. Use the --socket option to specify the
#name of the pipe, if we do not wish to have the default naming on pipes.

#Default port is 3306
#mysql --host=remote.example.com Defaults to port being 3306

#To specify a port use --port or -P
#mysql --host=remote.example.com --port=13306

#Do note, attempting to ordane localhost on a unix system will use a socket file
#to circumvent this, use more explicit denotation

#mysql --port=13306 --host=localhost Will ignore the port part on a Unix system, as it defaults to a socket file

#mysql --port=13306 --host=127.0.0.1
#mysql --port=13306 --protocol=TCP

#We can utilize things akin to hints to denote what the client-side authentication plugin should be:
#
#--default-auth=plugin

#To utilize pipes, we can use:
#--pipe, -W
#However, the server must be started with the --enable-named-pipe option to enable named-pipe connections.

#We can denote what kind of protocol to use, which relates back unto what kind of a OS is permissible to utilize it
#
# --protocol=TCP - TCP/IP connection to local or remote server, usable by all
#
# --protocol=SOCKET - Unix socket file connection to local server, Unix only

# --protocol=PIPE   - Named-pipe connection to local or remote server, Windows only

# --protocol=MEMORY - Shared-memory connection to local server, Windows only

#Do denote, for most cases - overhead is avoided with Socket default integrations in Unix systems.

#To run with Shared memory:

#--shared-memory-base-name=name , defaults to MYSQL. Server must be started with --shared-memory

#--socket=file_name, -S file_name - On Unix, the Unix socket file to use, for connections made using a named pipe to a local server.
# On Unix, defaults to /tmp/mysql.sock
# 
# On windows, the named pipe name to use. defaults to MySQL.

#Server must be started with --enable-named-pipe to enable this.

#--ssl* to start up connection based on SSL layering

#--tls-version=protocol list
#Denotes the protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections. The value is a comma-separated list containing one
#or more protocol names.

#The protocols usable for this option depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL.

#--user=user name, -u user_name - username to be used. default on Windows is ODBC or the Unix login name on Unix.

#We can modify options files akin to the Client section of an option file.

#We can also utilize PATH variables, akin to MYSQL_HOST, USER or MYSQL_PWD.

#The following section showcases the Path parameters in terms of connections
#They are bound to URI type strings or data dictionaries

#scheme:Specifies the connection protocol to use. To account for a specific protocol, use mysqlx, mysql for classic
#MySQL protocol connections. If a protocol is not specified - the server attempts to guess the protocol.

#user: Specifies the MySQL user account to be used for the authentication process.

#password: Specifies the password to be used for the authentication process. Do not store hte PW in the connection path

#host: Specifies the server instance the connection refers to. Can be either an IpV4 address, an IpV6 address or a hostname. If not specified,
#localhost is used by default.

#port: Specifies a network port which the target MySQL server is listening on for connections. If not specified, 33060 is used by default
#for X protocol connections.

#3306 is the default for classic MySQL protocol connections.

#socket: path to a Unix socket or Windows named-pipe. The values are local file paths and must be encoded in URI type strings,
#using % encodings or surrounding the path with ()'s - as full resolution of path is then realized, instead of needing to escape for explicit stature.

#To connect as root@localhost using Unix sockets, we can use /tmp/mysqld.sock we can use % or ()'s:

#()'s:
#root@localhost?socket=(/tmp/mysqld.sock)

#%'s:
#root@localhost?socket=%2Ftmp%2Fmysqld.sock

#Basically in the case of % escaping, we replace the direct symbols with underlying unicode translations
#akin to accessing of typing/other structuring.
#It resolves to /, regardless.

#schema: specifies the database to be set as default when a connection is established.

#?attribute=value: Specifies a data dictionary that contains options.

#The params are case insensitive and can only be defined once.
#If defined more than once, a error is generated.

#When a dictionary is used, the following options are also valid:
#
#ssl-mode: the SSL mode to be used for the connection.
#
#ssl-ca: the path to the X.509 cert authority in PEM format.
#
#ssl-capath: the path to the directory that contains the X.509 certs authorities in PEM format.
#
#ssl-cert:The path to the X.509 certs in PEM format.
#
#ssl-key: The path to the X.509 key in PEM format.
#
#ssl-crl: The path to file that contains certificate revocation lists
#
#ssl-crlpath: The path to the directory that contains certificate revocation list files.
#
#ssl-cipher: the SSL cipher to use.
#
#tls-version: List of protocols permitted for secure connections.
#
#auth-method: Authentication method used for the connection. Defaults to AUTO, meaning that the server attempts to guess.
#Can be one of the following:
#
#AUTO, MYSQL41, SHA256_MEMORY, FROM_CAPABILITIES, FALLBACK, PLAIN

#Whenever we use a X Protocol connection, any configured auth-method is overridden to this sequence of authentication methods:
#MYSQL41, SHA256_MEMORY, PLAIN.

#get-server-public-key. 
#Requests the public key from the server required for RSA key-paired based password exchange.
#
#use this when connecting to the MySQL 8.0 servers over classic MySQL protocol with SSL mode DISABLED.
#You must specify the protocol in this case, for example:
#
#mysql://user@localhost:3306?get-server-key=true

#server-public-key-path: The path name to a file containing a client-side copy of the public key required for RSA key pair-based password exchange.
#Use when connecting to MySQL 8.0 servers over classic MySQL protocol with SSL mode DISABLED.

#The ?attribute=value options data dictionary can contain are the following options:
#
#mycnfPath: the path to the MySQL configuration file of the instance.
#
#outputMycnfPath: alternative output path to write the MySQL configuration file of the instance.
#
#password: the password to be used by the connection.
#
#clusterAdmin: the name of the InnoDB cluster administrator used to be created. The supported format is the standard
#MySQL account name format.
#
#clusterAdminPassword: the password for the innoDB cluster admin account.
#
#clearReadOnly: a boolean value used to confirm that super_read_only must be disabled.
#
#interactive: A boolean of which disables the interactive wizards of assignments of variables/non-assignments etc.

#restart: A boolean of which is used to indicate that a remote restart of the target instance should be performed to finalize operations.

#The following is a covering of how to connect using a URI string

#We can specify a connection using a URI type string format. Such strings can be used with
#the MySQL Shell --uri command option, along with the MySQL Shell \connect command

#This also applies to tools like MySQL Routers and Connectors of whom implement X DevAPI.

#A typical URI type string has the following format:

#[scheme://][user[:[password]]@]target[:port][/schema][?attribute1=value1&attribute2=value2]

#Note, that reserved keywords must be escaped, akin to:
#% - %25
#@ - %40

#Some examples of connections being made with this formatting:
#
#A classical MySQL protocol connection to a local server instance listening at port 3333
#mysql://user@localhost:3333
#
#A X Protocol connection to a local server instance listening at port 33065
#mysqlx://user@localhost:33065
#
#A X protocol connection to a remote server instance, using a host name, an IpV4 address and an IpV6 address.
#
#mysqlx://user@server.example.com/
#mysqlx://user@198.51.100.14:123 IPV4 address
#mysqlx://user@[2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348]
#
#We can also specify a optional path which represents a DB schema
#mysqlx://user@198.51.100.1/world%5Fx Basically, the encoding/escaping of chars akin to %5Fx is Hexadecimal and akin.
#mysqlx://user@198.51.100.2:33060/world

#Where of the following example illustrates a connection to a localhost, SSL integration with certs,
#key and cert.
#
#The example is just to illustrate the difference between escaping of characters and paranthesis integration
#
#ssluser@127.0.0.1?ssl-ca=%2Froot%2Fclientcert%2Fca-cert.pem\
#&ssl-cert=%2Froot%2Fclientcert%2Fclient-cert.pem\
#&ssl-key=%2Froot%2Fclientcert%2Fclient-key

#ssluser@127.0.0.1?ssl-ca=(/root/clientcert/ca-cert.pem)\
#&ssl-cert=(/root/clientcert/client-cert.pem)\
#&ssl-key=(/root/clientcert/client-key)

#Denote, the above documentation assumes that the integration does require a Password based on Syntax interaction.
#
#To account for a passwordless structure of where we can access the structure without a explicit PW,
#i.e - pw-less or integrated unto Unix socket connections, we must use the following Syntax:
#
#mysqlx://user:@localhost

#We can also utilize Dictionaries in terms of connection details towards a server, with the
#shell.connect() or dba.createCluster() MySQL Shell commands and with MySQL Connectors that implement the X DevAPI.

#Unlike URI strings, we need not escape characters in a Dictionary structure composition.

#If no PW is specified in the dict, none is promted for.

#Some examples are as follows:

#A X protocol connection to a local server @ port 33065
#{user:'user', host:'localhost', port:33065}

#A classic MySQL protocol X protocol connection, local server @ 3333
#{user:'user', host:'localhost', port:3333}

#An X protocol connection to a remote server instance, using a host name, an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address, is showcased:
#
#{user:'user', host:'server.example.com'}
#{user:'user', host:198.51.100.14:123}
#{user:'user', host:[2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348]}
#
#We can also display an optional schema to represent a DB
#
#{user:'user', host:'localhost', schema:'world'}
#
# The above showcasing requires a PW.
# Showcasing case of no PW integration required
#
# {user:'user', password:'', host:'localhost'}

#There are a number of ways that we can specify program options:

#CMD line after the instegated command

#Options file to integrate options before running the program

#List the options in the environment variables

#Since the options are iteratively parsed, on duplications, the last one in the ordering is commited:

#mysql -h example.com -h localhost <- Will resolve to -h Localhost, since repetition of -h command parsing

#In the case of conflicting or related options are given - the later in the ordering is taken, instead of the earlier
#mysql --column-names --skip-column-names

#The ordering of processing is:
#Environment variables
#option files
#command line

#for the server, mysqld-auto.cnf takes highest prio (i.e, last)

#The following designates and showcases the usage of options on the CMD line

#Options are given after the cmd name

#A option argument begins with one or two dashes, depending on the format of the option.
#
#An example is the help command:
#
#-? (short) or --help (long)

#Option namings and designations are case sensitive. Example showcasing this:
#
# -v (verbose) or -V (version)

#Of course, sometimes options need arguments, as is showcased:
#
#-h localhost 
#
#or
#
#--host=localhost

#Delegation of parameters in long formatted PWs are separated with a =
#
#--password=<some value goes here> #Incinuates that we are to connect with said PW
#
#--password #Prompts for PW

#In the case of shortcutting the letter designation of password prompts, the dynamics can be seen as follows:
#
#mysql -ptest #Will attempt to access with a PW value of test, to whatever DB it defaults to
#
#mysql -p test #Will attempt to access the test DB, with no pw defined

#Do denote, that in terms of commands _ and - are synonymous in terms of interpretation
#
#--skip-grant-tables is the same as --skip_grant_tables

#We can also utilize suffixes in terms of utilization of commands.

#The notations are as follows: K, M, G (1024^1, 1024^2, 1024^3)
#
#In 8.0.14 or beyond:
#T,P,E (1024^4, 1024^5, 1024^6)

#For instance, if we wish to ping the server 1024 times intertwined with the power:

#mysqladmin --count=1K --sleep=10 ping 
#Denotes to ping 1024 times, 10 seconds interval

#If using filenames as option values, do not use ~

#When we denote to make queries on the CMD line, we use "" encapsulation, for instance
#
#mysql -u root -p --execute="SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user" #Connect using the user of root, prompt for pw, execute the escaped Query
#

#Different levels of escaping might be needed, in terms of " or '
#
#Multiple statements can be passed in the option value on the CMD line separated by semicolons:
#
#mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT VERSION();SELECT NOW()"

#If we wish - we can disable/enable certain parts:

#Disabling:
#--disable-column-names
#--skip-column-names
#--column-names=0

#Enabling:
#--column-names
#--enable-column-names
#--column-names=1

#We can also use TRUE, OFF, FALSE - Non-case sensitive

#If we denote the --loose, it is a option of denoting that the program do not exit upon an error or unrecognized command, instead it does so with a warning
#
#mysql --no-such-option #Would cause an error, unrecognized command
#
#mysql --loose-no-such-option #Would exit with a warning, despite unrecognized command

#We can also limit session values, akin to memory allocation - as follows, in mysqld:
#
#--maximum-max_heap_table_size=32M - Prevents a client from making the heap table size limit larger than 32M.
#
#--maximum cannot be applied to system vars that are global in scope:
#
#--maximum-back_log=200 #Gives an error because attempted designation to a global system var

#In case of if we wish to denote what options files are read, we can use --verbose and --help
#
#a MySQL program with --no-defaults reads no option files other than .mylogin.cnf
#
#A server started with the persisted globals load system var disabled does not read mysqld-auto.cnf

#The login path group options allow for the following:
#
#host,user,password,port and socket

#To  define what login path to read from in the .mylogin.cnf - we can use the --login-path option.

# If we wish to specify another login path file name, we can set the MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE environment variable.
# This variable is used by mysql-test-run.pl and is recognized by other mysql clients.

#There is a second config file, that is auto managed by the server - that is called:
#
#mysqld-auto.cnf file in the data directory. This is a JSON file that contains persisted system var settings.
#
#It is created by the server upon execution of SET PERSIST or PERSIST_ONLY.
#
#One should not manage said fail alone, and leave that to the server.

#On Windows systems, the files are read in the following order:
#
# NAME 																	PURPOSE
#
# %WINDIR%\my.ini, %WINDIR%\my.cnf 							Global options

# C:\my.ini, C:\my.cnf 											Global options

# BASEDIR\my.ini, BASEDIR\my.cnf 							Global options

# defaults-extra-file 											The file specified with --defaults-extra-file (if any)

# %APPDATA%\MySQL\.mylogin.cnf 								Login path options (clients only)

# DATADIR\mysqld-auto.cnf 										System variables persisted with SET PERSIST or PERSIST_ONLY (server only)

#The %WINDIR% and %APPDATA% are basically system path designations that are found by utilization of Regex,
#to find them, we can simply echo their  designation in the cmd line:
#
# C:\> echo %WINDIR% #Showcases where the Windows directory is
#
# C:\> echo %APPDATA% #Showcases where the Appdata dir is

#BASEDIR refers to the MySQL base install dir. usually, it is at C:\PROGRAMDIR\MySQL\MySQL 8.0 Server
#where the Programdir, is the program files dir.

#DATADIR is the MySQL data dir. It is used to find mysqld-auto.cnf - the default being the data dir loc
#built in when MySQL was compiled - but can be changed with --datadir specified as a option-file.

#It can also be changed by virtue of cmd line designation before the mysqld-auto.cnf is processed.

#On Unix, the ordering of the startup is as follows:
#
# FILE NAME 						PURPOSE
# /etc/my.cnf 						Global options
# /etc/mysql/my.cnf 				Global options
# SYSCONFDIR/my.cnf 				Global options
# $MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf 			Server-specific options (server only)
# defaults-extra-file 			The file specified with --defaults-extra-file, if any
# ~/.my.cnf 						User-specific options
# ~/.mylogin.cnf 					User-specific login path options (clients only)
# DATADIR/mysqld-auto.cnf 		System variables persisted with SET PERSIST or PERSIST_ONLY (server only)

#As per usual, the ~ denotes the home dir, the set system var of $HOME
#
# SYSCONFDIR is the dir specified with the SYSCONFDIR option to CMake when MySQL was built.
# By default, this is the etc file dir

# MYSQL_HOME is an env variable containing the path to the dir in which the server-specific my.cnf file
# resides.
#
# If MYSQL_HOME is not set and you start the server using mysqld_safe, mysqld_safe sets it to BASEDIR, the MySQL base install dir.

# DATADIR refers to the MySQL data dir. As used to find mysqld-auto.cnf, its default value is the data dir location built in when
# MySQL was compiled.
#
# can be changed with --datadir specified as an option-file or command-line option processed before mysqld-auto.cnf is processed.

# If multiple instances are given, the latest is taken.
#
# The one exception is mysqld, where the first is taken of the --user option as security precaution.

#The following integration rules adheres to the manually edited files - not standing in terms of the .mylogin.cnf which is
# created using mysql_config_editor and is encrypted. 
#
# This too accounts for mysqld_auto.cnf, which the server creates in JSON.

#In terms of Options files, the following rules are adhered to:

# Any cmd line integrated on CMD line is done with --, in option files we omit thoose.

# Empty lines are ignored. Comments start with ; or #

# [group] denotes a group subsectioning. Holds until end of file or different Group designation.

#Leading and trailing spaces are deleted. We can have spaces around the =

#We are allowed to use the following escape sequences:
#
# \b, \t, \n, \r, \\ and \s
#
# they are in order:
#
# backspace, tab, newline, carriage return, backslash and space

#The chars are only escaped if they are not valid commands. i.e, \s is not escaped - \S is, due to invalid command.

#The above implies that we can write a \ as either: \\ or \

#The escape rules in terms of opton files is denoted as conversion unto "(char)" upon errornous registration of a command.
#As in, if \x is not a command, it's converted to "x"

#Note: In option files, on Windows - \ can be written as / as well

#Examples of usage:

#basedir="C:\\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0"
#basedir="C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0"
#basedir="C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0"
#basedir=C:\\Program\sFiles\\MySQL\\MySQL\sServer\s8.0

#If a option name denotation is the same as a program name, then that group applies specifically to that program.
#Akin to:
#
# [mysqld] and [mysql] applying to mysqld and mysql respectively.

# [client] is read by all client programs provided in MySQL distributions.

# Do note, we have to be careful about level of options that we put in in terms of Client,
# that it is understood by all levels of the clients. If not understood, the client will raise an exception and quit.

#In terms of ordering of hierarchy in terms of options, we go from:
#
#Highest global reach
#
# More specific
#
# Most specific
#
# For instance:
#
# [client]
# port=3306
# socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
#
# [mysqld]
# port=3306
# socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
# key_buffer_size=16M
# max_allowed_packet=128M
#
# [mysqldump]
# quick

#Another example of a option file:

#[client]
# Send out a standardized password for all client level integrations
# password="my password"

#[mysql]
#no-auto-rehash
#connect_timeout=2

#We can target versionings as well:
#
#[mysqld-8.0]
#sql_mode=TRADITIONAL

#To include specific files or even dirs, we can use !include and !includedir
#
# !include /home/mydir/myopt.cnf #reads that specific config file
#
# !include /home/mydir #reads all the option files in mydir

#On Windows, the extensions included are .ini and .cnf
#
#Linux is .cnf
#
#Past that, MySQL does not guarantee ordering of integration

#As far as Grouping goes contra Parsing, as we iterate - we integrate what actually is
#targeted by the respective groupings - akin to that if MySQLD is reading something - it will
#trigger thoose respective groups.

#Past this, we can come to talk about CMD line options that affect option-file handling

#The following commands, to function properly - must be given before other options, except for:
#
# --print-defaults can be used after --defaults-file, --defaults-extra-file or --login-path
#
# On Windows, if the server is started with the --defaults-file and --install options,
# --install must be first.
#

#--defaults-extra-file=file_name - reads this option file after the global option file 
#
# On Unix, this is read before the user option file 

# On all platforms, this is read before the login path file.

# The parameter name in terms of file name, is treated as a relative path towards the CWD.
# To fundamentally assess greater control, we can denote the full explicit path, if we want

# --defaults-file=file_name - reads the given option file.
# 
# Note: even with the above, mysqld refers to mysqld-auto.cnf and client refers to .mylogin.cnf

# --defaults-group-suffix=str
#
# Denotes a default suffix of grouping name to read.
#
# For instance - a parameter name of "dogs" would groups that have a suffix of "dogs",
# like - [options_dogs]

# --login-path=name
#
# Reads options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
# This specific group denotes which MySQL server to connect to and which account to authenticate as.
#
# To create or modify this login path file - use the mysql_config_editor

#This path is read even if --no-defaults is set.
#
# The given command is appended unto the already list of defaulted programs, as can be showcased:
#
# mysql --login-path=somextra
#
# Would end up with mysql reading [client] and [mysql] from the option files,
# and [client], [mysql], and [mypath] from the login path file.

#To specify an alternate login path file name, set the MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE env variable

#--no-defaults
#
# Prevents default option files from being read.
# Will still read .mylogin.cnf

#--print-defaults
#
#Prints the program name and all of the options that it gets from the option files.
#PWs are masked.

# --max_allowed_packet=32M #Can be specified in Bytes.
#
# Still power denotation in terms of K, M, G (1024^1, 1024^2, 1024^3) and T,P,E (1024^4, 1024^5, 1024^6)
#
# In option files:
#
# [mysql]
# max_allowed_packet=32M #can be specified in bytes

#- and _ are treated as equals in the context of variable names
#
# example:
#
# [mysqld]
# key_buffer_size=512M
# 
# is identical to
#
# [mysqld]
# key-buffer-size=512M

#In terms of variable naming, we can give ambigious naming that can be autocompleted,
#However, it's just a better idea to denote a option name htat is fully declared.

# mysql --max=1000000 would be interpreted as ambigious as it would not be clear to what it means, in terms of
# meaning max_allowed_packet or max_join_size
# to which we would be warned.

#Server setup denotation of commands do not support arithmetic interpretation in terms of intialization
#
# mysql --max_allowed_packet=16M #Allowed in server startup
# mysql --max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024 #Not allowed, due to being a operation

# At runtime, when the server is running etc, though:
# SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16M; #Not allowed in a runtime env.
# SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024;

#For options that do not require a value, we can omit the assignment operator in notation (=):
#
# mysql --host=somehost --user=someguy #Usable with default value integrations
#
# mysql --host tonfisk --user jon #Usable with non-default value integrations

# In terms of omitting variables names, can cause errors akin to skipping, as showcased:
#
# mysql --host --user jon #Will give an error in trying to access host --user

#An example of denoting of where to log errors, in terms of a UNIX system
# NOTE: For safety, use = assignment in variable name contexts

# mysqld_safe --log-error=my-errors & #The & is just a background designation operator for UNIX systems
#
#For default isntallation and relative pathing, this gives to:
# '/usr/local/mysql/var/my-errors.err'

#The next section will be about setting ENV Vars

#We can denote environment variables in terms of Usernames, ports, exporting etc:
#
# SET USER=your_name
#
# For unix systems, accounting for sh, ksh, bash, zsh:
#
# MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3306
# export MYSQL_TCP_PORT
#
# For csh and tcsh:
#
# setenv MYSQL_TCP_PORT 3306

#The above are allocated to session. To denote for more permanent startup status:
#
# Windows -> Control panel
#
# Unix (Bash) -> .bashrc or .bash_profile for bash 
# Unix (tcsh) -> .tcshrc

#An example of modifying the path denotation variable in Bash
#
# #Assume /usr/local/mysql/bin is the installation path
# 
# PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin #put in .bashrc file to allow for easy access to MySQL setup in terms of options

#Note, the .bashrc is for login shells, and .bash_profile is for nonlogin shells

#In the case of tcsh:
# setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin

#The next section is mysqld_safe

#Some Unix systems involve usage of a MySQL Server startup that is safer,
#i.e - mysqld_safe

#These features include things like restarting the server and logging runtime info to an error log.

#On some specific UNix systems, akin to RPM or Debian, include systemd support for managing MySQl server
#startup/shutdown.

#If we wish to override the default options and specify a explicit name of the server we wish to run
#we can specify --mysqld or --mysqld-version option to mysqld_safe.

#You can also use --ledir to indicate the dir where mysqld_safe should look for the server.

#The options in terms of mysqld_safe is the same as mysqld

#If the option is unknown to mysqld_safe, they are passed to mysqld if it's done on the cmd line
#
#However, if this is done in a option file - specified to [mysqld_safe] as a group
#they are ignored.

#mysqld_safe will read all of the options from the [mysqld], [server] and [mysqld_safe] sections
#in option files.

#Note, for backwards compability cases - mysqld_safe also reads [safe_mysqld] sections

#The following denotes the options for mysqld_safe

# Format 	 					Desc
#	
# --basedir 					path to MySQL installation dir
# --core-file-size 			Size of core file that mysqld should be able to create
# --datadir 					path to the data dir
# --defaults-extra-file 	Read named option file in addition to usual option files
#
# --defaults-file 			Read only named option file
# --help 						display help message and exit
# --ledir 					 	Path to directory where server is located
# --log-error 					Write error log to named file
#
# --malloc-lib 						Alternative malloc library to use for mysqld
# --mysqld 								Name of server program to start (in ledir directory)
# --mysqld-safe-log-timestamps 	Timestamp format for logging
# --mysqld-version 					Suffix for server program name
# --nice 								Use nice program to set server scheduling priority
# --no-defaults 						Read no option files
#
# --open-files-limit 				Number of files that mysqld should be able to open
# --pid-file 							Path name of server process ID file
# --plugin-dir 						Directory where plugins are installed
# --port 								Port number on which to listen for TCP/IP connections

# --skip-kill-mysqld 				Do not try to kill stray mysqld processes
# --skip-syslog 						Do not write error messages to syslog; use error log file
# --socket 								Socket file on which to listen for Unix socket connections

# --syslog 								Write error messages to syslog
# --syslog-tag 						Tag suffix for messages written to syslog
# --timezone 							Set TZ time zone environment variable to named value
# --user 								Run mysqld as user having name user_name or numeric user ID user_id

#Some further covering in terms of different parts
#
#--help - Display a help message and exit
#
#--basedir=dir_name - The path to the MySQL install dir

#--core-file-size=size - The size of the core file that mysqld should be able to create. 
#The value of the option is passed to ulimit -c
#
# If we disable innodb buffer pool in core file, we can reduce the core file size.

#--datadir=dir_name - The path to the data dir

#--defaults-extra-file=file_name - Read this option file in addition to the usual option files.
#
# If the file is not found, does not exist or permissions are not given - the server exists with an error.
#
# file_name is interpreted as relative to the current dir if given as a relative path name rather than
# a full path name. 
#
#This must be the first option on the cmd line if used.

#--defaults-file=file_name
#
#Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, the server exits with an error.
#
#file_name is interpreted as relative to the current dir if given as a relative path name rather than a explicit one.
#
#This must be the first option on the cmd line if used

#--ledir=dir_name - 
#
#If mysqld_safe cannot find the server, use this option to indicate the path name to the dir where the server is located.
#
#This command can only be given on cmdline, not in option files. On platforms that use systemd, the value can be specified
#in the value of MYSQLD_OPTS.

#--log-error=file_name
#
#Write the error log to the given file

#--mysqld-safe-log-timestamps
#
#This option is the one that controls the format of timestamps in the log output produced by mysqld_safe.
#
#If the value does not belong to any of the following, a warning is logged and resorts to UTC formatting.
#
#UTC,utc - ISO 8601 UTC format (this is the same as --log timestamps=UTC for the server) - Defaults to this

#SYSTEM, system - ISO 8601 local time format (same as --log timestamps=SYSTEM for the server)

#HYPHEN, hyphen - YY-MM-DD h:mm:ss format, as in mysqld_safe for MySQL 5.6

#LEGACY, legacy - YYMMDD hh:mm:ss format, as in mysqld_safe prior to MySQL 5.6

#--malloc-lib=[lib name]
#
#The name of the library to use for memory allocation instead of the system malloc() library. 
#
#The option value must be one of the dirs:
# /usr/lib
# /usr/lib64
# /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu
# /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

#The --malloc-lib option works by modifying the LD_PRELOAD env value to affect dynamic linking to enable
#the loader to find the memory-allocation library when mysqld runs.

#Some notes on this:

#If the option is not given, or is given without a value (--malloc-lib=), LD_PRELOAD is not modified
#and no attempt is made to use tcmalloc.

#If the option is given as --malloc-lib=tcmalloc, mysqld_safe looks for a tcmalloc library in /usr/lib
#
#If tcmalloc is found, its path name is added to the beginning of the the LD_PRELOAD value for mysqld.
#
#If tcmalloc is not found, mysqld_safe aborts with an error.

#If the option is given as --malloc-lib=/path/to/some/library, that full path is added to the beginning
#of the LD_PRELOAD value.
#
#If said path is not legitimate - as in nonexistent or unreadable, mysqld_safe aborts with an error.

#For the cases of where mysqld_safe adds a path name to LD_PRELOAD - it adds the path to the beginning of any
#existing value the variable already has.

#NOTE: In case that our system manage using systemd, mysqld_safe is not available.
#Thus - we instead specify the allocation lib by setting LD_PRELOAD in /etc/sysconfig/mysql.

#In terms of Linux, we can use the libtcmalloc_minimal.so lib on any platform for which a tcmalloc
#package is installed in /usr/lib by adding the following lines to my.cnf:
#
# [mysqld_safe]
# malloc-lib=tcmalloc

#To use a specific tcmalloc lib, specify its full path name:
#
# [mysqld_safe]
# malloc-lib=/opt/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so

#--mysqld=prog_name
#
#The name of the server program (in the ledir directory) that you want to start.
#
#This option is needed if you use the MySQL binary distirbution but have the data
#dir outside of the binary distribution.
#
#If mysqld_safe cannot find the server, use the --ledir option to indicate the path name
#to the dir where the server is located.
#
#This command is only available on cmd line, not in option files. On platforms that use systemd,
#the value can be specified in the value of MYSQLD_OPTS.

#--mysqld-version=suffix
#
#This option is similar to the --mysqld option, but you specify only the suffix for the server program name.
#The base name is assumed to be mysqld.
#
#--nice=priority
#
#Use the nice program to set the server's scheduling prio to the given value.

#--no-defaults
#
#Do not read option files. Can be used to prevent crashing of attempting to access invalid paths/errors raised are simply offset
#as in the failed files are not read.

#--open-files-limit=count
#
#The number of files that mysqld should be able to open. This options value is passed to ulimit -n.
#
#NOTE: This call requires root permissions in terms of level of started the program.

#--pid-file=file_name
#
#The path name that mysqld should use for its process ID file.

#--plugin-dir=dir_name
#
#The path name of the plugin dir

#--port=port_num
#
#The port number that the server should use when listening for TCP/IP connections. The port number
#must be 1024 or higher lest the server is started by root priveleges.

#--skip-kill-mysqld
#
#An option to disallow killings of stray mysqld processes at startup.
#Works only on Linux.

#--socket=path
#The Unix socket file that the server should use when listening for local connections.

#--syslog, --skip-syslog
#
# --syslog: Causes error messages to be sent to syslog on systems that support the logger program.

# --skip-syslog: suppresses the use of syslog; messages are written to a error log file.

#If syslog is used for error logging, daemon.err facility/severity is used for all log messages.

#However, the above is deprecated in terms of controlling mysqld.
#To control the facility, use the server log syslog facility system var.

#--syslog-tag=tag: also deprecated, use the server log syslog tag system var.

#--timezone=timezone - Sets the TZ time zone environment var to the given option value.
#Legal time zone specs is relative to OS doc specs

#--user={<USER> name|<USER> id}
#
#Run the mysqld server as the user having the name user_name or the numeric user ID user_id.
#(<USER> in this context refers to a system login account - not a part of the MySQL users in teh grant tables.)

#Illustration of forced ordering in terms of --defaults-file or --defaults-extra-file:
#
# mysqld_safe --port=port_num --defaults-file=file_name #Will ignore the default file command, due to not first place ordering
#
# mysqld_safe --defaults-file=file_name --port=port_num

#To have a decent run with mysqld_safe - one of the following conditions need to be true:
#
# If we executed mysqld_safe from the MySQL Install dir - the server and DB must be able to be found in terms of
# a relative path to the working dir.
#
# For binary distributions, mysqld_safe looks for bin and data in the CWD

# For source distris, it looks for libexec and var dirs

# If the above fails, it attempts by absolute paths akin to:
#
# /usr/local/libexec
#
# or 
#
# /usr/local/var

#These locations are determined upon config when installing MySQL.

#An example of running MySQL anywhere, based on relative pathing, assuming initial path is done to the MySQL Install dir:
#
# cd mysql_installation_directory
# bin/mysqld_safe & #Delegate to background job

#If this fails, we can delegate with --ledir or --datadir to indicate dirs for the server and DB.

#The default attempts to attempting to start is 5/second, by utility of sleep and date.
#If this is exceeded - it waits 1 full second before going at it again.

#Error messages go to syslog and stdout.
#To direct options - use syslog.

#The following covers server interaction on the CMD line.
#Naming refers to local installation naming, such as mysqld or mysql.
#I will simply refer to it as mysql here.

#This pertains to Linux systems.

#To start/Stop the script:
#
# mysql start #To start
# mysql stop  #To stop

#To run the server as some specific user, we can config the /etc/my.cnf - adding a user option to
# the [mysqld] group.

#To start or stop MySQL Automatically on the server - we can add start and stop commands in /etc/rc*

#If we use the Linux server RPM package (MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm) or a native Linux package, it may be installed
# in the /etc/init.d dir with the name mysqld or mysql.

#If we do not have the server installed, we can copy a version of it
#
#cp mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql  #Copy the server to the designated folder
#chmod +x /etc/init.d/mysql

#Depending on our system and integration of Unix - we can use chkconfig to activate it to run at system startup
#
# chkconfig --add mysql
#
# Sometimes, we need a different version
#
# chkconfig --level 345 mysql on

#If it is a version of FreeBSD, the scripts should generally go in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
#
#Install the mysql.server script as /usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql.server.sh to enable automatic startup

#The base name file pattern must be *.sh to trigger, otherwise it is silently ignored.

#Sometimes, some operative systems use /etc/rc.local or /etc/init.d/boot.local to start additional
#services on startup.
#
#To utilize it, append something akin to the following to a startup file:
#
# /bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &'

#mysql.server reads from [mysql.server] and [mysqld] sections of option files.
#
#We can add options for mysql.server in a global /etc/my.cnf, it might look as follows:
#
# [mysqld]
# datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var
# socket=/var/tmp/mysql.sock
# port=3306
# user=mysql

# [mysql.server]
# basedir=/usr/local/mysql

#The following are mysql.server option-file options
#
# Option Name 								Desc 														Type
# basedir 						Path to MySQL installation dir 								Directory name
# datadir 						Path to MySQL data directory 									Directory name
# pid-file 						File in which server should write its process ID  		File name
# service-startup-timeout 	How long to wait for server startup 						Integer

#The following is explonations of the different parts:
#
#basedir=<dir name> # The path to the MySQL installation dir
#
#datadir=<dir name> # The path to the MySQL data dir
#
#pid-file=<file name> # The path name of the file in which the server should write its process ID.
#
## if this option is not given, it defaults to <host_name>.pid
# This file value overrides the mysqld_safe specified in [mysqld_safe] option file group
#
# For safety in terms of the server value starting designations, we can specify both
# in [mysqld_safe] and [mysqld] groups.

# service-startup-timeout=<seconds>
#
# How many seconds to wait for confirmation of server startup.
# If the server does not start within said limit, mysql.server exits with an error.
# Defaults to 900.
#
# Negative is forever (no timeout), 0 is to not wait at all.

#The following is related to mysqld_multi - which is to manage multiple MySQL servers

#The mysqld_multi is designed to handle/listen to different connections on different Unix sockets files 
# and TCP/IP ports.

#The mysqld_multi searches for groups that are called [mysqldN] in my.cnf
#
# Or in the file named by the --defaults-file option
#
#N refers to the group number, to which can also be represented as GNR.
#It can be any positive integer.

#Each respective numeral represents a server/connection - they have their own values
#
#To invoke mysqld_multi - we can use the following syntax:
#
# mysqld_multi [options] {start|stop|reload|report} [GNR[, GNR] ...]

#If no list exists - mysqld_multi performs the operation for all servers in the option file.
#
#We can perform more specific numerals in terms of listing of gnr's, operations and listing of options

#Some examples of utilization of starting multiple servers, groupings etc:
#
# mysqld_multi start 17 #Just starts nr 17
#
# mysqld_multi stop 8, 10-13 #8, 10,11,12,13
#
# mysqld_multi --example #more examples

#The search order for option files are as follows:
#
# --no-defaults - no option files read
#
# --defaults-file=<file name> - onl the named file is read

# Beyond this standard prio is taken, incl. --defaults-extra-file=<file name>

#Option files read are searched for [mysqld_multi] and [mysqldN] option groups.
#
# The [mysqld_multi] can be used for options to mysqld_multi itself

# The [mysqldN] groups can be used for options passed to specific mysqld instances.

# The [mysqld] or [mysqld_safe] groups can be used for common options read by all instances of mysqld or
# mysqld_safe.

# We can specify a --defaults-file=<file name> option to use a different config file for that instance
# To which the sourceo f [mysqld] or [mysqld_safe] is redirected to this file.

# The following options are what pertain to mysqld_multi:
#
# --help - Displays a help message and exits
#
# --example - Display a sample option file
#
# --log=<file name> - Specify the name of the log file. If hte file exists, log output is appended to it.
#
# --mysqladmin=<prog name> - the mysqladmin binary to be used to stop servers
#
# --mysqld=<prog name> - The mysqld binary to be used. We can specify mysqld_safe for this option.
# if we do - we can include mysqld or ledir in the corresponding [mysqldN] option group.
#
# These options are to indicate the name of the server that mysqld_safe should start and the path
# name of the dir where the server is located.
#
# For instance:
#
# [mysqld38]
# mysqld = mysqld-debug
# ledir = /opt/local/mysql/libexec

# --no-log - Print log info to stdout rather than the log file. By default, it goes to log.

# --password=<password> - The PW of the MySQL acc to use when invoking mysqladmin. Non-optional, for this program.

# --silent - Silent mode, no warnings

# --tcp-ip - Connect to each MySQL server through the TCP/IP port instead of the Unix socket file.
# (If a socket file is missing, the server might still be running, but accessible only through the TCP/IP port)
#
# By default, the connections are made through the Unix socket file. Affects stop and report operations.

# --user=<user name> - User name of the MySQL acc to use when invoking mysqladmin

# --verbose - Verbose mode

# --version - Version info and exit

#NOTE: Use seperate dirs when splintering with mysqld servers.
#
# Make sure of clearance of reading/writing of each file dir.
#
#Splintering does not give performance increasing in terms of the threading pooling

#We also have to make sure that privs to SHUTDOWN is given, and that we have the same connection params for all
#parts involved. 

#Showcasing of targetting and giving privs to each resp. server:
#
# mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql sock -p #Will prompt for pw
# CREATE USER 'name_to_be_given_to_multi_admin'@'your_server' IDENTIFIED BY 'multipass'
#
# GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.* TO 'name_to_be_given_to_multi_admin'@'your_server'
#
# The above, is shorthand for giving shutdown privleges on all fronts in terms of the given user account 
#
# The above must be repeated for every mysqld server.
# We must also have multi_admin rights from where we connect with mysqld_multi

# The respective socket files in terms of Unix and TCP/IP port must be different for every mysqld.
#
# If the host has multiple network addresses, we can use --bind-address to cause different servers
# to listen to different interfaces

# The --pid-file option is important for if we use mysqld_safe to start mysqld (for example, --mysqld=<mysqld_safe>
# We need to have a seperate pid file for every respective mysqld.

# The advantage of using mysqld_safe instead of mysqld is that mysqld_safe monitors its mysqld process,
# allowing us to have restarts in case of kill signals (kill -9) or segmentation faults.

#To be allowed to use --user for mysqld, we have to run the mysqld_multi as root
#Designating options in the option file, does not matter.

# if we try to run mysqld whilst not root, we get a warning and it's run under our own Unix acc

#The following is an example of having a option file to use with mysqld_multi:

# The order of the mysqld programs are started or stopped depends on the order in the opt file
# The sequence need not be unbroken 

# [mysqld_multi] #The base mysqld_multi structure
# mysqld 		= /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe
# mysqladmin 	= /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
# user 			= multi_admin
# password 		= my_password

# [mysqld2] #The splinters
# socket 		= /tmp/mysql.sock2
# port 			= 3307
# pid-file 		= /usr/local/mysql/data2/hostname.pid2
# datadir 		= /usr/local/mysql/data2
# language 		= /usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/english
# user 			= unix_user1

# [mysqld3]
# mysqld 		= /path/to/mysqld_safe
# ledir 			= /path/to/mysqld-binary/
# mysqladmin 	= /path/to/mysqladmin
# socket 		= /tmp/mysql.sock3
# port 			= 3308
# pid-file 		= /usr/local/mysql/data3/hostname.pid3
# datadir 		= /usr/local/mysql/data3
# language 		= /usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/swedish
# user 			= unix_user2

# [mysqld4]
# socket 		= /tmp/mysql.sock4
# port 			= 3309
# pid-file 		= /usr/local/mysql/data4/hostname.pid4
# datadir 		= /usr/local/mysql/data4
# language 		= /usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/estonia
# user 			= some_user_5

# [mysqld6]
# socket 		= /tmp/mysql.sock6
# port 			= 3311
# pid-file 		= /usr/local/mysql/data6/hostname.pid6
# datadir 		= /usr/local/mysql/data6
# language 		= /usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/japanese
# user 			= unix_user4

#The next section covers MySQL installation related things, akin to:
# comp_err, ssl_rsa, tzinfo_to_sql, mysql_upgrade etc.

#comp_err:

# Creates the errmsg.sys file that is used by mysqld to determine the error message to display
# for different error codes.

# comp_err normally is run automatically when MySQL is built. It compiles the errmsg.sys file
# from the text file located at sql/share/errmsg-utf8.txt in the MySQL source distr.

# It also generates mysqld_error.h, mysqld_ername.h and sql_state.h header files

# To invoke comp_err:

# comp_err [options]

# Supports the following options:

# --help, -? - Displays a help message and exit

# --charset=<dir name>, -C dir_name - The char set directory. The default is ../sql/share/charsets

# --debug=<debug options>, -# <debug options> - Write a debug log. 
# A typical debug_options string is d:t:O, <file name>
# the default is:
# d:t:O, /tmp/comp_err.trace

# --debug-info, -T - Print debug info when the program exits

# --header file=<file name>, -H <file_name> - name of the error header file. 
# defaults to: mysqld_error.h

# --in file=<file name>, -F <file_name> - The name of the input file.
# defaults to: ../sql/share/errmsg-utf8.txt

# --name file=<file name>, -N <file_name> - The name of the error name file.
# Defaults to: mysqld_ername.h

# --out dir=<dir name>, -D <dir name> - Name of output base dir
# Defaults to: ../sql/share/

# --out file=<file name>, -O <file name> - Name of the output file
# Defaults to: errmsg.sys

# --statefile=<file name>, -S <file_name> - Name of the SQLSTATE header file.
# Defaults to: sql_state.h

# --version, -V #Displays version info and exits

# mysql_secure_installation:
#
# Allows us to set pw for root accs, remove root accs outside of localhost, remove anon users, remove the test DB
# (The test DB can be accessed by anon users/all users) - we can also remove permits of dbs with name that starts with
# test_

# Base usage:
# mysql_secure_installation

# Doing this, will prompt for an action.

# We can utilize validate_password to check PW strength.

# Showcasing of using cmd line and options files to connect:
#
# mysql_secure_installation --host::1 --port=3307

#The following options can be defined by cmd line or in option file groups of:
# [mysql_secure_installation] 
# [client]

#The options of the mysql_secure_installation are as follows:
#
# FORMAT 													DESC
#
# --defaults-extra-file 				Read named option file in addition to usual option files
# --defaults-file 						Read only named option file
# --defaults-group-suffix 				Option group suffix value
# --help 									Display help messages n exit
# --host 									Host to connect to (IP address or host name)
# --no-defaults 							Read no option files
# --password 								Accepted but ignored. Prompt occurs regardless
# --port 									TCP/IP port number for connection
# --print-defaults 						Print default options
#
# --protocol 								Connection protocol to use
# --socket 									For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use
# --ssl-ca 									File that contains list of trusted SSL Certs Auths
# --ssl-capath 							Dir that contains trusted SSL Cert Auth cert files
# --ssl-cert 								File that contains X.509 certificate
# --ssl-cipher 							List of permitted ciphers for connection encryption
#
# --ssl-crl 								File that contains cert revocation list files
# --ssl-crlpath 							Dir that contains cert revocation list files
# --ssl-fips-mode 						Whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side
#
# --ssl-key 								file that contains X.509 key
# --tls-version 							Protocols permitted for encrypted connections
# --use-default 							Execute with no user interactivity
# --user 									MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server

# Further explaining of subsections:
#
# --help, -? - Display a help message and exit
# --defaults-extra-file=<file name> - Reads this option file after the global option file, but before the user option file.
# --defaults-file=<file name> - use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is inaccessible, errors occur.
# 										  Pathing is: relative (default), full on explicit designation
# --defaults-group-suffix=<str> - Additional groupings to read in terms of suffix regex designation (i.e, all of the defaults + suffix matches)
# --host=<host_name>, -h <host_name> - Connect to the MySQL Server on the given host.
#
# --no-defaults - Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to reading unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be used to
# prevent them from being read.
#
# As per usual, if .mylogin.cnf exists - it is read, regardless of options.

# --password=<password>, -p <password> - The option is accepted but ignored. mysql_secure_installation always prompts for PW.
# --port=<port num>, -P <port_num> - TCP/IP port to use for the connection

# --print-defaults - Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files
# --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY} - The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server.
# --socket=<path>, -S <path> - What Unix socket/Windows pipe to use when connecting to localhost.
# --ssl* - Connect using SSL, implies need to specify SSL keys and certs.

# --ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT} - Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side.
# Denotes what cryptographic operations are permitted - not actually used to establish encrypted connections.

# OFF - Disables FIPS mode.
# ON - Enables FIPS mode.
# STRICT - Enable "strict" FIPS mode.

# If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the onl permitted value is OFF.
# Attempting to ordane ON or STRICT, causes warning at startup, resorting to non-FIPS mode.

# --tls-version=<protocol list> - Protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections. The value is a comma-separated list
# containg one or more protocol names.
#
# The protocols used depend on the SSL lib used to compile MySQL.

# --use-default - Execute noninteractively. Can be used for unattended installation operations

# --user=<user name>, -u <user_name> - MySQL user name when connecting to the server.

#Next section covers: mysql_ssl_rsa_setup - Creating SSL/RSA files
#
# creates the SSL certificate and key files and RSA key-pair files required to support secure
# connections using SSL and secure password exchange using RSA over unencrypted connections,
# if those files are missing.
#
# Can also be used to create new SSL files if existing ones have expired.
#
# Note, these forms of certs are self-signed - i.e, not safe. This is more about the principle of creation/usage,
# not the factual gain of security in terms of usage.
#
# To invoke mysql_ssl_rsa_setup:
#
# mysql_ssl_rsa_setup [options]
#
# The typical options are --datadir to specify where to create the files, and --verbose to see the openssl commands
# that mysql_ssl_rsa_setup executes.
#
# mysql_ssl_rsa_setup attempts to create SSL and RSA files using a default set of file names. It works as follows:
#
# > checks for the openssl binary at the locations specified by the PATH env var.
# > If not found - nothing happens.
#
# If openssl is present, mysql_ssl_rsa_setup looks for default SSL and RSA files in the MySQL data dir specified
# by the --datadir option or the compiled-in data dir if the --datadir option is not given.
#
# > Checks the data dir for SSL files with the following names:
# ca.pem
# server-cert.pem
# server-key.pem
#
# > If any of the above exist, no SSL files are created. Otherwise, openssl is invoked to create them, for a total of:
#
# ca.pem 			#Self-signed CA cert
# ca-key.pem 		#CA private key
# server-cert.pem #Server cert
# server-key.pem 	#Server private key
# client-cert.pem #Client cert
# client-key.pem 	#Client private key
#
# > Checks data dir for RSA files with the following names:
#
# private_key.pem 	#Private member of private/public key pair
# public_key.pem 		#Public member of private/public key pair

# If any of the above is present, mysql_ssl_rsa_setup creates no RSA files.
# Otherwise, invokes openSSL to create them.
#
# The files enable secure PW exchange using RSA over unencrypted connections for
# accounts authenticated by the sha256_password or caching_sha2_password plugin

# When starting the MySQL Server, it automatically uses the SSL files created by mysql_ssl_rsa_setup
# to enable SSL if no explicit SSL options are given other than --ssl (possibly also --ssl-cipher)
#
# If we prefer to designate the files explicitly, invoke the clients with the --ssl-ca, --ssl-cert and
# --ssl-key options to name the ca.pem, client-cert.pem and client-key.pem files, respectively
#
# The server also automatically uses the RSA files created by mysql_ssl_rsa_setup to enable RSA, if none are explicitly given
#
# If the server has activated SSL, the client uses SSL by default for the connection.
#
# Also, to circumvent the read/write permission problems in terms of locations of Certs,
# due to that the initialized data dir permissions is restricted to the System account that runs the server.
#
# To make the files available, copy them to a dir that is readable (but not writable) by clients:
#
# For local clients, the MySQL install is assumed, thus, we can use a relative path in terms of implied referal in copying:
#
# cp ca.pem client-cert.pem client-key.pem
#
# For remote clients, we distribute the files using a secure channel to ensure they are not tampered with.
#
# If the SSL files have expired - we can use mysql_ssl_rsa_setup to create new ones:
#
# > Stop the server
# > Rename or remove the existing SSL files. You may wish to make a backup of them first.
# (RSA's do not expire)
# > Run mysql_ssl_rsa_setup with the --datadir option to specify where to create the new files.
# >Restart the server

# mysql_ssl_rsa_setup supports the following CMD line options - can be specified on the CMD line or 
# in the [mysql_ssl_rsa_setup] and [mysqld] groups of an option file.

# Options for mysql_ssl_rsa_setup :
#
# FORMAT 			DESC
# --datadir 		Path to data directory
# --help 			Display help messagee and exit
# --suffix 			Suffix for X.509 cert Common Name attribute
# --uid 				Name of effective user to use for file permissions
# --verbose 		Verbose mode
# --version 		Display version info and exit

# Further explonation of the commands:
#
# --help, ? - Display a help message and exit
# --datadir=<dir name> - The path to the directory that mysql_ssl_rsa_setup should check for default SSL and RSA files and in
# which it should create files if they are missing. 
#
# Defaults to compiled-in data dir
#
# --suffix=<str> - Suffix of the common name attribute in X.509 certs. The suffix value is limit to 17 chars.
# The default is based on the MySQL version number.
#
# --uid=<name>, -v - The name of the user who should be the owner of any created files. The value is a user name,
# not a numeric user ID. 
#
# In case this is absent, files created by mysql_ssl_rsa_setup are owned by the user who executes it. This option is 
# valid only if you execute the program as root on a system that supports the chown() system call.
#
# --verbose, -v - Verbose mode. Tells about if it skipped SSL, RSA file creation and openssl commands being run.
#
# --version, -V - Display version info and exit.

#Next covers mysql_tzinfo_to_sql - The time Zone tables
#
# Loads the time zone tables in the mysql db. It is used on systems that have a zoneinfo DB (set of files that describe time zones)
#
# Examples of such OS's: Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and OS X. One likely location for these is the /usr/share/zoneinfo dir
# (/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo on Solaris).
#
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql can be invoked several ways:
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql <tz_dir>
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql <tz_file> <tz_name>
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql --leap <tz_file>

#Exampel of invocation:
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql #Pipe the output to mysql from the zoneinfo dir path name, access mysql with root user

# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql reads the systems time zone files and generates SQL statements from them. mysql processes them to load the time zone tables.
# 
# The second syntax, loads a single time zone file <tz_file> that corresponds to a time zone name tz_name:
#
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql <tz_file> <tz_name> | mysql -u root mysql
#
# If we need to account for leap seconds, use the third syntax noted in the above ordering.

#To account for the newly initialized data and to circumvent previously cached time zone data 
# we have to restart the server.

#Next up, is mysql_upgrade

#mysql_upgrade is a utility in terms of integrating updates to tables and capacities in terms of between versionings

#If mysql_upgrade finds that a table has a possible incompability - it performs a table check and, if issues are found
#attempts a table repair.

#The mysql_upgrade runs updating in terms of the MySQL tables

#The base initialization of command is:

#mysql_upgrade [options]

#After we have run mysql_upgrade - we need to stop and restart it.

#If we have multiple MySQL servers running - we can invoke mysql_upgrade with connection parameters
#as can be showcased:
#
# mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3306 [other_options]
# mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3307 [other_options]
# mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3308 [other_options]

#In terms of running on localhost on Unix, the --protocol=tcp options forces a connection
#using TCP/IP rather than the Unix socket file

#NOTE: In case of disabled_storage_engines sys var set to disable certain storage engines (for instance, MyISAM)
#mysql_upgrade might fail as follows:
#
# mysql_upgrade: [ERROR] 3161: Storage engine MyISAM is disabled (Table creation is disallowed)
#
# To handle it, restart the server with disabled_storage_engines disabled.
# We can then run mysql_upgrade successfully. 
#
# After that, restart the server with disabled_storage_engines set to its original value

#mysql_upgrade runs a version comparison in terms of a file named mysql_upgrade_info in the data dir.
#
#This is used to quickly check whether all tables have been checked for this release so that
#table-checking is skipped.
#
#To ignore this file, run --force

#Unless we invoked with --skip-sys-schema - then mysql_upgrade installs the sys schema and upgrades it.
#
# However, if there exists one and has no version view - we have to rename it/remove it and then
#run the upgrade.

#If we wish, we can upgrade specific individual tables with ALTER TABLE ... UPGRADE PARTITIONING

#mysql upgrade can fail to upgrade due to expired PWs, which we can reset with the following:

#mysql -u root -p #Then reset the PW with alter user
#ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';

#Run the mysql_upgrade again after having exited:
#mysql_upgrade [options]

#The following options are the ones that mysql_upgrade supports

#The showcasing in terms of Options and what they do:
#
# --help - Display a short help message and exit
# --basedir=<dir name> - The path to the MySQL installation dir
# --bind-address=<ip address> - On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this to decide which one to use for connecting
# --character-sets-dir=<dir name> - The dir where char sets are installed
#
# --compress, -C - Compress all info between client and server, if both support compression.
# --debug[=<debug options>], -# [<debug options>] - Writes a debug log. Typical: d:t:o, <file_name>
# Defaults to: d:t:O,/tmp/mysql_upgrade.trace

#
# --defaults-group-suffix=<str> - Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with usual names and suffix of <str>.
#   										 Normally reads [client] and [mysql_upgrade] - treats str input as suffix regex.
# --force - 							 Ignore the mysql_upgrade_info and force run
#
# --get-server-public-key 			 Requests the public key required for the RSA key-pair PW exchange.
# 											 Applies to the clients whom authenticate with caching_sha2_password auth plugin.
# 											 In case of usage of this plugin - the server does not send the public key lest requested.
# 											 The option is ignored for accs that do not authenticate with said plugin.
# 					
# 											 If a secure connection is rendered to the server, RSA exchange is not used - as such, this command is then ignored.
#
# 											 If --server-public-key-path=<file name> is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes precedence over
# 											 --get-server-public-key
#
# --host=<host name>, 				 Connect to the MySQL on the given host. 
# -h <host name>
# --login-path=<name> 				 Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
# 											 The login path is the group option that specifies which MySQL server to connect to
# 											 and which acc to authenticate as.
#
# --max-allowed-packet=<value> 	 The max size of the buffer for client/server communication. Defaults to 24MB. Min is 2kb, max is 2Gb.
# --net-buffer-length=<value> 	 The initial size of the buffer for client/server comm. Default is 1MB - 1kb. The min 4KB, max 16MB
# --no-defaults 						 Do not read any option files. Prevents exception raising failures
# 							
# 											 Exception is .mylogin.cnf file, if it exists - is read in all cases (reading PW from File)
# --password[=<password>], 		  
# -p [<password>]	  					 PW. -p prevents space after input, --password without value prompts for it
#
# --pipe, -W 							 On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. Applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections
# --plugin-dir=<dir name> 			 The dir in which to look for plugins. Use if --default-auth is used for an Auth plugin, but it is not found.
# --port=<port num>, 
# -P <port_num> 						 The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.
# --print-defaults 					 Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files.
#
# --protocol=
#{TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY} 			 The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. 
# 											 It is useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause
# 											 a protocol to be used other than the one you want.
#
# --server-public-key-path=       The path name to a file containing a client-side copy of the public key required by the server
# <file name> 							 for RSA key pair-based PW exchange. The file must be in PEM format.
#              
# 											 This option applies to clients that authenticate with the sha256_password or caching_sha2_password
# 											 authentication plugin. This is ignored for accounts that do not authenticate with one of those plugins.
#
# 											 It is also ignored if RSA-based pw exchange is not used, as is the case when the client connects to
# 											 the server using safe connections (SSL)
#
# 											 If --server-public-key-path=<file name> is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes
# 											 precedence over --get-server-public-key.
#
# 											 For Sha256_pw, this applies only if we used SSL to build the MySQL.
#
# --shared-memory-base-name= 		 On Windows, the shared memory name to use, for connections made using shared memory to a local server.
# <name> 								 Defaults to MySQL. Case-sensitive. Must startup with --shared-memory to enable shared-memory connections.
#
# --skip-sys-schema 					 mysql_upgrade installs the sys schema if it is not installed, and upgrades it to the current version otherwise.
#                                 This suppresses that behavior.
#
# --socket=<path>, -S <path> 		 Connections to localhost, Unix socket file to use - Windows, the named pipe to use.
# --ssl* 								 Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect the server using SSL and indicate where to 
# 											 find SSL keys and certs.
#
# --ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT} Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side. The --ssl-fips-mode option differs from other
# 										    --ssl-xxx options in that it is not used to establish encrypted connections, but rather to affect which
# 											 cryptographic operations are permitted.
#
# 											 The options are: OFF (Disable FIPS mode), ON (Enable FIPS mode), STRICT (Enable "strict" FIPS mode).
# 											 
# 											 If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only permitted value is OFF. 
# 											 Going against it, produces a warning and starts in non-FIPS mode.
#
# --tls-version=<protocol list> 	 The protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections. The value is a comma-separated list 
# 											 containing one or more protocol names. 
# 												
#                                 The protocols that can be named for this option depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL.
#
# --upgrade-system-tables, -s 	 Upgrade only the system tables, do not upgrade the data.
#
# --user=<user name>,  				 The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. defaults to root.
# -u <user_name>
# 
# --verbose 							 Verbose mode
#
# --version-check, -k 				 Check the version of the server to which mysql_upgrade is connecting to verify that it is
# 											 the same as the version for which mysql_upgrade was built.
# 
# 											 This option is enabled by default - to disable it, use --skip-version-check
#
# --write-binlog 						 By default, binary logging by mysql_upgrade is disabled. Invoke the program with 
# 											 --write-binlog if you want its actions to be written to  the binary log.
#
# 											 When the server is running with global transactions identifiers (GTIDs) enabled
# 										    (gtid mode=ON), do not enable binary logging by mysql_upgrade.
#
# The next section covers mysql on the cmd line
#
# If used interactively, query results are presented in an ASCII table format.
# If not, it's in a tab-separated format.
#
# If there is not enough memory, use --quick. Forces usage of one row at a time instead of 
# buffering in memory and retrieving everything. Utilizes mysql_use_result() C api in the client/server lib,
# instead of the mysql_store_result()
#
# Examples of simple usages:
#
# mysql <db_name>
#
# mysql --user=<user_name> --password <db_name> #Causes prompt
#
# Ctrl+C stops current query or partial inputs.
# To finish a query on the cmd line, end with ;, \g or \G and Enter
#
# We can execute SQL statements in a script file (batch file) as follows:
# mysql db_name < script sql > output tab
#
# On Unix, the client logs statements executed interactively to a history file.

# Further explonation of the interactions:
#
# --help, -? - Display a help message and exit
# --auto-rehash - Enable automatic rehashing. On by default, enables database, table and column name completion.
# 					   Use --disable-auto-rehash to disable rehashing. That causes mysql to start faster, but you must
# 						issue the rehash command or its \# shortcut if you want to use name completion.
#
# 						To cycle through completion of names, write the first part and press Tab to cycle Regex matchings.
# 						Does not trigger unless there is a default DB.
#
# 						The above requires a MySQL client that is compiled with the readline library. Typically, the readline
# 						library is not available on Windows.
#
# --auto-vertical-output - Cause result sets to be displayed vertically if they are too wide for the current window, and using
# 									normal tabular format otherwise. (Applies to statements terminated by ; or \G)
#
# --batch, -B 				 - Print results using tab as the column separator, with each row on a new line. With this option, mysql
# 									does not use the history file.
#
# 									Batch mode results in nontabular output format and escaping of special characters. Escaping may be
# 									disabled by using raw mode; see the description for the --raw option.
#
# --binary-as-hex 			When this option is given, mysql displays binary data using hexadecimal notation (0x value).
# 									This occurs whether the overall output display format is tabular, vertical, HTML or XML.
#
# --binary-mode 				This option helps when processing mysqlbinlog output that may contain BLOB values.
# 									By default, mysql translates \r\n in statement strings to \n and interprets \0 as
# 									the statement terminator.
#
# 									This option disables both features. Also disables all mysql commands except charset and delimiter
# 									in non-interactive mode (for input piped to mysql or loaded using the source command)
#
# --bind-address= 			On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this option to select which interface to use
#   <ip address> 				for connecting to the MySQL server.
#
# --character-sets-dir= 	The directory where char sets are installed.
#   <dir name>
#
# --column-names 				Write column names in results
#
# --column-type-info 		Display result sets metadata
#
# --comments, -c 				Whether to strip or preserve comments in statements sent to the server. (DEPRECATED)
# 									Defaults to --skip-comments (strip comments), enable with --comments (preserves them)
# 
# 									Note: Commands and queries directed towards the server - are just hints. Server yields final say.
# 														
# --compress, -C 				Compress all information sent between client and the server if both support compression.
#
# --connect-expired- 		Indicate to the server that the client can handle sandbox mode if the account used to connect has an expired PW.
#   password 					Can be useful for noninteractive invocations of mysql because normally the server disconnects noninteractive clients
# 									that attempt to connect using an account with an expired PW.
#
# --database=<db_name>, 	The DB to use. Useful primarily in a option file.
#   -D <db_name>
#
# --debug[=<debug_options>], Write a debugging tool. A typical <debug_options> string is d:t:o, <file_name>. Defaults to d:t:o, /tmp/mysql.trace
#   -# [<debug options>]     Available only if MySQL was built using WITH_DEBUG.
#
# 									  MySQL release binaries are NOT designed for this option.
#
# --debug-check 				Print some debugging information when the program exits.
#
# --debug-info, -T 			Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage stats when the program exits.
#
# --default-auth=<plugin>  A hint about the client-side auth plugin to use
#
# --default-character-set  Use charset_name as the default char set for the client and connection.
# =<charset_name> 			This option can be useful if the OS uses one char set and the mysql client by default
# 									uses another.
#
# 									In this case, output may be formatted incorrectly. You can usually fix such issues by using
# 									this option to force the client to use the system char set instead.
#
# --defaults-extra-file 	Read this option file after the global option file but (On Unix) before user option files.
# =<file name> 				If not found/inaccessible, error raised. Relative if not full path specified, explicit otherwise.
#
# --defaults-file 			Use only the given option file. .mylogin.cnf is still read. If not found/inaccessible, error raised.
# =<file name>
#
# --defaults-group-suffix  Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with the usual names and a suffix of <str>.
# =<str> 						Regex triggering of suffix sorting, basically.
#
# --delimiter=<str> 			Set the statement delimiter. The default is the semicolon char (;)
#
# --disable-named-commands Disable named commands. Use the \* format only, or use named commands only at the beginning of a line ending with (;)
# 									Starts with this option enabled by default.
#
# 								   Even with this option, long-format commands still work from the first line.
#
#--enable-cleartext-plugin Enables the mysql_clear_password cleartext authentication plugin.
#
# --execute=<statement>, 	Execute the statement and quit. The default output format is like that produced with --batch.
#  -e <statement>
# 									If this option is done, the history file is not used by MySQL.
#
# --force, -f 					Continue even if an error is raised
#
# --get-server-public-key  Request from the server the public key required for RSA key pair-based PW exchange.
# 									This option applies to clients that authenticate with the caching_sha2_password authentication plugin.
#
# 									For that plugin, the server does not send the public key unless requested. This option is
# 									ignored for accounts that do not authenticate with that plugin. 
#
# 									It is also ignored if RSA-based PW exchange is not used, as is the case when the client connects
# 									to the server using a secure connection.
#
# 									If --server-public-key-path=<file name> is given and specifies a valid public key file,
# 									it takes precedence over --get-server-public-key
#
# --histignore 				Colon-seperated list of one or more patterns specifying statements to ignore for logging purposes.
# 									The patterns are added to the default pattern list ("*IDENTIFIED*:*PASSWORD*")
#
# 									The value specified for this option affects logging of statements written to the history file, and
# 									to syslog if the --syslog option is given.
#
# --host=<host name>, 		Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.
# -h <host name>
#
# --html, -H 					Produce HTML Output
#
# --ignore-spaces, -i 		Ignore spaces after function names. The effect of this is described in the discussion
# 									for the IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode
#
# --init-command=<str> 		SQL statements to execute after connecting to the server. If auto-reconnect is enabled, the statement
# 									is executed again after reconnection occurs.
#
# --line-numbers 				Write line numbers for errors. Disable this with --skip-line-numbers.
#
# --local-infile[={0|1}] 	Enable or disable LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA INFILE. For mysql, this capability is disabled by default.
# 									With no value, the option enables LOCAL. This option may be given as --local-infile=0 or --local-infile=1 
# 									to explicitly disable or enable LOCAL.
#
# 									Enabling local data loading also requires that the server permits it.
#
# --login-path=<name> 		Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
# 									A "login path" is an option group containing options that specify which MySQL server
# 									to connect to and which account to authenticate as.
#
# 									To create or modify a login path file, use the mysql_config_editor.
#
# --named-commands, -G 		Enables named mysql commands. Long-format commands are permitted, not just short-format commands.
# 									For example, quit and \q both are recognized. Use --skip-named-commands to disable named commands.
#
# --no-auto-rehash, -A 		This has the same effect as --skip-auto-rehash.
#
# --no-beep, -b 				No beep @ errors
#
# --no-defaults 				Do not read any option files. Prevents error causing files. 
# 									.mylogin.cnf is read regardless.
#
# --one-database, -o 		Ignore statements except those that occur while the default DB is the one named on the CMD line.
# 									This option is rudimentary and should be used with care.
#
# 									Statement filtering is based only on USE statements.
#
# 									Initially, mysql executes statements in the input because specifying a DB <db_name>
# 									on the CMD line is the equivalent to inserting USE <db name> at the beginning of the input.
#
# 									Then, for each USE statement encountered, mysql accepts or rejects following statements depending on
# 									whether the database named is the one on the CMD line.
#
# 									The content of hte statement is irrelevant.
#
# 									Assuming the following Query:
# 									DELETE FROM db2.t2; USE db2; DROP TABLE db1.t1; CREATE TABLE db1.t1 (i INT); USE db1;
# 									INSERT INTO t1 (i) VALUES(1); CREATE TABLE db2.t1 (j INT);
#
# 									If the command to process it, is: 
# 									mysql --force --one-database db1, mysql
#
# 									The DELETE statement is executed because the default database is db1, even though the statement
# 									names a table in a different database.
#
# 									The DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements are not executed because the default database is not db1,
# 									even though the statements named a table in db1
#
# 									The INSERT and CREATE TABLE statements are executed because the default database is db1, even though
# 									the CREATE TABLE statement names a table in a different database.
#
# --pager[=<command>] 		Use the given command for paging query output. If the command is omitted, the default pager is the value of
# 									your PAGER environment variable.
#
# 									Valid pagers are less, more, car [> filename>], and so forth. This option works only on Unix and only
# 									in interactive mode. To disable it - use --skip-pager.
#
# --password=[=<password>] The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option form (-p), you cannot
#   ,-p[<password>]        have a space between the option and the PW.
#
# 									If you omit the PW value following the --password or -p option on the command line, mysql prompts for one.
#
# --pipe, -W 					On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. This option applies only if the server supports named-pipe
# 									connections.
#
# --plugin-dir=<dir name> 	The dir in which to look for plugins. Specify this option if the --default-auth option is used to specify an authentication
# 									plugin but mysql does not find it.
#
# --port=<port num>, 		The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection. 
#  -P <port_num>
#
# --print-defaults 			Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files.
#
# --prompt=<format str> 	Set the prompt to the specified format. The default is mysql>. The special sequences
# 									that the prompt can contain are described later.
#
# --protocol={TCP|SOCKET 	The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is useful when the other connection
#   |PIPE|MEMORY} 			parameters normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the one you want.
#
# --quick, -q 					Do not cache each query result, print each row as it is received. This may slow down the server if the output is suspended.
# 									With this option, mysql does not use the history file.
#
# --raw, -r 					For tabular output, the "boxing" around columns enables one column value to be distinguished from another.
# 									For nontabular output (such as is produced in batch mode or when the --batch or --silent option is given),
# 									special chars are escaped in the output so they can be identified easily.
#
# 									Newline, tab, NUL, and backslash are written as \n, \t, \0, and \\. The --raw disables the char escaping.
#

#
# --reconnect
# If the connection to the server is lost, automatically try to reconnect. A single reconnect attempt 
# is made each time the connection is lost.
#
# To surpress the reconnection behavior, use --skip-reconnect.
#
# --safe-updates, --i-am-a-dummy, -U
# Permit only those UPDATE and DELETE statements that specify which rows to modify by using key values.
# If you have set this option in an option file, you can override it by using --safe-updates on
# on the cmd line.
#
# --secure-auth
# This option was removed in MySQL 8.0.3
#
# --server-public-key-path=<file name>
# The path name to a file containing a client-side copy of the public key required by the server for RSA key pair-based password exchange.
# The file must be in PEM format.
# This option applies to clients that authenticate with the sha256_password or caching_sha2_password authentication plugin.
# 
# This option is ignored for accounts that do not authenticate with one of those plugins. It is also ignored for instances of
# RSA-based PW exchange not being used.
#
# If --server-public-key-path=<file name> is defined and is valid, it takes precedence over --get-server-public-key
# It is only available if MySQL was built using OpenSSL.
#
# --shared-memory-base-name=<name>
# On Windows, the shared-memory name to use, for connections made using shared memory to a local server.
# The default is MySQL. Case-sensitive.
# 
# Must start with --shared-memory to enable shared-memory connections.
#
# --show-warnings
# Causes warnings to be shown after each statement if there are any. This option applies to interactive and batch mode.
#
# --sigint-ignore
# Ignore SIGINT signals (typically the result of using CTRL+C)
#
# --silent, -s
# Silent mode. Produces less output. 
# This option can be given multiple times to produce less and less output.
# Results in nontabular output format and escaping of special characters. 
# Escaping may be disabled by using
# raw mode. (--raw)
# 
# --skip-column-names, -N
# Do not write column names in results
#
# --skip-line-numbers, -L
# Do not write line numbers for errors. Useful when you want to compare result files that include error messages.
#
# --socket=<path>, -S <path> 
# For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use - or on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.
#
# --ssl*
# Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the server using SSL and indicate where to find
# SSL keys and certs.
#
# --ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT}
# Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side.
# The --ssl-fips-mode option differs from other --ssl-xxx options in that it is not used to
# establish encrypted connections, but rather to affect which cryptographic ops are permitted.
#
# These --ssl-fips-mode values are permitted:
# 		OFF - disables fips mode
# 		ON  - enables fips mode
#     STRICT - Enable "strict" FIPS mode.
#
# If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only permitted value for --ssl-fips-mode is OFF.
# In this case, setting --ssl-fips-mode to ON or STRICT - produces a warning, and defaults to OFF.
#
# --syslog, -j
# Causes mysql to send interactive statements to the system logging facility.
# On Unix, this is syslog; on Windows, it is the Windows Event Log.
#
# The destination where logged messages appear is system dependent. 
#
# On Linux, the destination is often the /var/log/messages file.
#
# a sample of output generated on Linux by using --syslog.
# Each line is usually one line:
#
# Mar 	7 12:39:25 myhost MysqlClient[20824]:
# 		SYSTEM_USER:'oscar', MYSQL_USER:'my_oscar', CONNECTION_ID:23,
# 		DB_SERVER:'127.0.0.1', DB:'--', QUERY:'USE test;'
# Mar 	7 12:39:28 myhost MysqlClient[20824]:
# 		SYSTEM_USER:'oscar', MYSQL_USER:'my_oscar', CONNECTION_ID:23,
# 		DB_SERVER:'127.0.0.1', DB:'test', QUERY:'SHOW TABLES;'
#
# --table, -t
# Display output in table format. This is the default for interactive use, but can be used to produce
# table output in batch mode.
#
# --tee=<file name>
# Append a copy of output to the given file. This option works only in interactive mode.
#
# --tls-version=<protocol list>
# The protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections. 
# The value is a comma-separated list containing one or more protocol names.
# The protocols that can be named for this option depend on the SSL lib used to compile MySQL.
# 
# --unbuffered, -n
# Flush the buffer after each query.
#
# --user=<user name>, -u <user_name>
# The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
#
# --verbose, -v
# Verbose mode. Can be given multiple times.
#
# --version, -V
# Version info and exit
#
# --vertical, -E
# Print query output rows vertically (one line per column value).
# Without this option, you can specify vertical output for individual statements
# by terminating them with \G.
#
# --wait, -w
# If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry insteaed of aborting.
#
# --xml, -X
# Produce XML output
# <field name="column_name">NULL</field>
#
# The output when --xml is used with mysql matches that of mysqldump --xml.
#
# An example of output is as follows:
#
# mysql --xml -uroot -e "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'"

#
# If MySQL is invoked with the --binary-mode option, all mysql commands are disabled except charset and delimiter
# in non-interactive mode (for input piped to mysql or loaded using the source command)
#
# Each command has both a long and short form. Long is not case-sensitive. Short is.
#
# Long can be followed by an optional semicolon terminator, but short should not.
#
# We are not allowed to use multiple line comments with /* ... */
#
# the following showcases the different commands in terms of long format and short format
#
# help [arg], \h [arg], \? [arg], ? [arg]
# 
# Displays a help message listing the available mysql commands.
# The arg input to help, acts as regex match in server-side help commands.
#
# charset <charset_name>, \C <charset_name>
#
# Changes the default character set and issues a SET_NAMES statement. This enables the character set to remain
# synchronized on the client and server if mysql is run with auto-reconnect enabled (not recommended),
# as the specified char set is used for reconnects.
# 
# clear, \c
# Clear the current input. Use this if you change your mind about executing the statement that you are entering.
#
# connect [<db_name> <host_name>]], \r [<db name> <host name>]]
#
# Reconnect to the server. The optional database name and host name arguments may be given to specify the default
# DB or the host where the server is running.
#
# If omitted, the current values are used.
#
# delimiter <str>, \d <str>
# 
# Change the string that mysql interprets as the separator between SQL statements. The default is the semicolon char (;)
#
# The delimiter string can be specified as an unquoted or quoted argument on the delimiter command line. Quoting can be done
# with either single quote ('), double quote (") or backtick (`) chars.
#
# To include a quote within a quoted string, either quote the string with a different quote character or
# escape the quote with a (\) char.
#
# Backslash should be avoided outside of quoted strings because it is the escape character for MySQL.
# For an unquoted argument, the delimiter is read up to the first space or end of line.
#
# For a quoted argument, the delimiter is read up to the matching quote on the line.
#
# mysql interprets instances of the delimiter string as a statement delimiter anywhere it occurs, except within
# quoted strings.
#
# Be careful about defining a delimiter that might occur within other words. For example, if you define
# the delimiter as X, you will be unable to use the word <INDEX> in statements.
#
# Mysql interprets this as <INDE> followed by the delimiter X.
#
# When the delimiter recognized by mysql is set to something other than the default of ;,
# instances of that character are sent to the server without interpretation.
#
# However, the server itself still interprets ; as a statement delimiter and process statements
# accordingly. This behavior on the server side comes into play for multiple-statement execution,
# for parsing the body of stored procedures and functions, triggers and events.
#
# edit, \e
# Edit the current input statement. mysql checks the values of the EDITOR and VISUAL env variables
# to determine which editor to use.
#
# The default editor is vi if neither variable is set.
#
# The edit command works only in Unix.
#
# ego, \G
# Send the current statement to the server to be executed and display the result using vertical format.
#
# exit, \q
# Exit mysql
#
# go, \g
# Send the current statement to the server to be executed.
#
# nopager, \n
# Disable output paging. See the description for pager.
#
# The nopager command works only in Unix.
#
# notee, \t
# Disable output copying to the tee file. See the description for tee.
#
# nowarning, \w
# Disable display of warnings after each statement.
#
# pager [<command>], \P [<command>]
# Enable output paging. By using the --pager option when you invoke mysql, it is possible to browse or search query
# results in interactive mode with Unix programs such as less, more, or any other similar program.
#
# If you specify no value for the option, mysql checks the value of the PAGER environment variable and sets the
# pager to that. Pager functionality works only in interactive mode.
#
# Output paging can be enabled interactively with the pager command and disabled with nopager.
# The command takes an optional argument; if given, the paging program is set to that.
#
# With no arg, the pager is set to the pager that was set on the command line, or stdout if no pager was specified.
#
# Output paging works only in Unix because it uses the popen() function, which does not exist on Windows.
# For Windows, the tee option can be used instead to save query output, although it is not as convenient
# as pager for browsing output in some situations.
#
# print, \p
# Print the current input statement without executing it
#
# prompt [<str>], \R [<str>]
# Reconfigure the mysql prompt to the given string. The special character sequences that can be used in the
# prompt are described later in this section.
#
# If you specify the prompt command with no argument, mysql resets the prompt to the default of mysql>.
#
# quit, \q
# Exit mysql.
#
# rehash, \#
# Rebuild the completion hash that enables database, table and column name completion while you are entering statements.
# (See the description for the --auto-rehash option)
#
# resetconnection, \x
# Reset the connection to clear the session state.
#
# Resetting a connection has effects similar to mysql_change_user() or an auto-reconnect except that
# the connection is not closed and reopened, and re-authentication is not done.
#
# Showcasing of example:
#
# SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(3); #gives 3
# SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(); #gives 3, still set to this
# resetconnection; #Resets defaults
# SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(); #Gives 0, reset has been done

# source <file_name>, \. <file_name>
# Read the named file and execute the statements contained therein. On Windows, you can specify
# path name separators as / or \\.
#
# Quote characters are taken as part of the file name itself. For best results, the name should not
# include space characters.
#
# status, \s
# Provide status information about the connection and the server you are using.
# If you are running in --safe-updates mode, status also prints the values for the
# mysql variables that affect your queries.
#
# system <command>, \! <command>
# Execute the given command using your default cmd interpreter.
# Works only on Unix.
#
# tee [<file_name>], \T [<file_name>]
# By using the --tee option when you invoke mysql, you can log statements and their output.
# All the data displayed on the screen is appended into a given file.
#
# This can be very useful for debugging purposes also. mysql flushes results to the file
# after each statement, just before it prints its next prompt.
#
# Tee functionality works only in interactive mode.
#
# You can enable this feature interactively with the tee command. Without a parameter,
# the previous file is used. The tee file can be disabled with the notee command.
#
# Executing tee again re-enables logging.
#
# use <db_name>, \u <db_name>
# Use <db_name> as the default DB.
#
# warnings, \W
# Enable display of warnings after each statement (if there are any)
#
# Tips about the pager command:
# 
# Example of writing only to a file:
# pager cat > /tmp/log.txt
#
# We can also pass options with the pager
# pager less -n -i -S
#
# Example of piping to different files mounted on two different systems, still displaying to screen using less:
# pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt \
# 			| tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S
#
# We can also combine the tee and pager functions. Have a tee file enabled and pager set to less, and you are
# able to browse the results using the less program and still have everything appended into a file the same time.
#
# The difference between the Unix tee used with the pager command and the mysql built-in tee command is that the
# built-in tee works even if you do not have the Unix tee available.
#
# The built-in tee logs everything that is printed on the screen, where as the Unix tee used with pager
# does not log equal amounts.
#
# Additionally, tee file logging can be turned on and off interactively from within mysql. This is useful
# when you want to log some queries to a file, but not others.
#
# The prompt command reconfigures the default mysql> prompt. The string for defining the prompt can
# contain the following special sequences:
#
# Option 					Desc
# \C 				The current connection identifier
# \c 				A counter that increments for each statement you issue
# \D 				The full current date
# \d 				The default database
# \h 				The server host
#
# \l 				The current delimiter
# \m 				Minutes of the current time
# \n 				A newline char
# \O 				The current month in three letter format (Jan, Feb, etc.)
# 
# \o 				The current month in numeric format
# \P 				am/pm
# \p 				The current TCP/IP port or socket file
# \R 				The current time, in 24-hour military time(0-23)
#
# \r 				The current time, standard 12-hour time (1-12)
# \S 				Semicolon
# \s 				Seconds of the current time
# \t 				A tab char
#
# \U 				Your full user_name@host_name acc name
# \u 				Your user name
# \v 				The server version
# \w 				The current dat of the week in three letter format (Mon, Tue, etc.)
#
# \Y 				The current year, four digits
# \y 				The current year, two digits
# \_ 				A space
# \ 				A space (space after the \)
# \' 				Single quote
# \" 				Double quote
# \\ 				A literal backslash char
#
# \x 				x, for any "x" not listed above

# There is a number of ways we can change the prompt:
#
# An environment variable: 
# export MYSQL_PS1="(\u@\h) [\d]> "
#
# A cmd line option. Can set the prompt with --prompt on the cmd line:
# mysql --prompt="(\u@\h) [\d]> "
# (user@host) [database]>
#
# Using an option file. Prompt option in the [mysql] group, such as /etc/my.cnf or the .my.cnf in the home dir:
# [mysql]
# prompt(\\u@\\h) [\\d]>\\_
#
# \\ is used in the option file for explicit escaping.
#
# We can also set it interactively, by using prompt or \R

# prompt (\u@\h) [\d]>\_
# PROMPT set to '(\u@\h) [\d]>\_'
# (user@host) [database]>
# (user@host) [database]> prompt
# Returning to default PROMPT of mysql>
# mysql>
#
#The next part covers Mysql logging
#
# The mysql client can do these types of logging for statements executed interactively:
#
# Unix -> mysql writes the statements to a history file. By default, the file is named .mysql_history in your home dir.
# To specify a different file, set the value of the MYSQL_HISTFILE env variable.
#
# On all platforms, if the --syslog option is given, mysql writes the statements to the system logging facility.
# Unix -> syslog
# Windows -> Windows Event Log
#
# the destination where logged messages appear is system dependent. On Linux, the destination is often
# the /var/log/messages file.
#
# How Logging Occurs:
#
# For each enabled logging destination - statement logging occurs as is shown:
# 
# Statements are logged only when executed interactively. Statements are noninteractive, for example, when read
# from a file or a pipe. It is also possible to suppress statement logging by using the --batch or --execute option.
#
# Statements are ignored and not logged if they match any pattern in the "ignore" list. Shown later.
#
# mysql logs each nonignored, nonempty statement line individually.
#
# If a nonignored statement spans multiple lines (not including the terminating delimiter), mysql concatenates
# the lines to form the complete statement, maps newlines to spaces and then logs the result + a delimiter.
#
# For instance:
# SELECT
# 	'Today is'
#  ,
#  CURDATE()
#  ;
#Gives:
# SELECT 'Today is' , CURDATE();

# mysql ignores for logging purposes statements that match any pattern in the "ignore" list.
# By default, the pattern list is "*IDENTIFIED*:*PASSWORD*", to ignore statements that identify as PWs.

# Two chars are significant in terms of the regex pattern: ? (Single wildcard char), * any sequence of zero or more chars.
#
# To specify additional patterns, use the --histignore option or set the MYSQL_HISTIGNORE env variable.
# Option value takes precedence.
#
# The value should be a colon separated list, which are appended to the default list.
# An example of a pattern delimiter defined on the cmd line, to ignore UPDATE and DELETE:
#
# mysql --histignore="*UPDATE*:*DELETE*"
#
# If we do not wish to maintain a hist file, cause it can contain PW info, we can remove it and do one of hte following:
#
# Set the MYSQL_HISTFILE env var to /dev/null - put in one of the shell startup files, causing deployment of options at the startup.
# 
# Create .mysql_history as a symbolic link to /dev/null; - only needs to be done once:
#
# ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history
#
# syslog Logging Characeristics
#
# If the --syslog option is given, mysql writes interactive statements to the system logging facility.
# Message logging has the following characteristics:
#
# Logging occurs at the "informational" level. 
# This corresponds to the LOG_INFO priority for syslog on Unix/Linux syslog capability and to 
# EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE for the Windows Event Log.
#
# Message size limit is 1024 bytes.
#
# Messages consists of the identifier MysqlClient followed by these values:
#
# SYSTEM_USER - The system user name (login name) or -- if the user is unknown.
# 
# MYSQL_USER  - The MySQL user name (specified with the --user option) or -- if the user is unknown.
#
# CONNECTION_ID - The client connection identifier. This is the same as the CONNECTION_ID() function value within the session.
#
# DB_SERVER - The server host or -- if the host is unknown
# 
# DB - The default database or -- if no DB has been selected.
#
# QUERY - The text of the logged statement.
#
# Example of output generated on Linux by using --syslog. Formatted for readability, each logged message takes a single line:
#
# Mar 	7 12:39:25 myhost 	MysqlClient[20824]:
# 		SYSTEM_USER:'oscar', MYSQL_USER:'my_oscar', CONNECTION_ID:23,
# 		DB_SERVER:'127.0.0.1', DB:'--', QUERY:'USE test;'
# Mar 	7 12:39:28 myhost 	MysqlClient[20824]:
# 		SYSTEM_USER:'oscar', MYSQL_USER:'my_oscar', CONNECTION_ID:23,
# 		DB_SERVER:'127.0.0.1', DB:'test', QUERY:'SHOW TABLES;'

# The following section covers the mysql Server-Side Help
#
# mysql> help <search_string>
#

# The following showcases of how to execute SQL statements from a Text File
#
# Typically the mysql client is interactively done as:
#
# shell> mysql <db_name>
#
# However - we can run a script from a file, unto a DB - as follows:
#
# shell> mysql <db_name> < <text_file>
#
# If we include a USE <db_name> statement as the first statement in the file, no DB name must be done on the cmd line.
#
# If mysql is already running - we can execute a SQL script file using the source command or \. command:
#
# mysql> source <file_name>
# mysql> \ <file_name>

# mysql ignores Unicode byte order mark (BOM) chars at the beginning of input files.

#MYSQL tips section next

# Input-Line Editing
#
# mysql supports input-line editing, which enables you to modify the current input line in place or recall previous input lines.
# For example, up/down arrows moves between previous entered lines.
#
# To change the set of key sequences permitted by a given input library, define key bindings in the library startup file.
# .editrc for libedit and .inputrc for readline
#
# in Libedit:
# CTRl+W - deletes everything before current cursor pos.
# CTRL+U - the entire line.
#
# in readline:
# Ctrl+W - deletes the word before the cursor
# CTRl+U - deletes everything before the current cursor pos.

# Unicode on Windows:
# provided through UTF-16LE APIs reading from and to the console.
# The mysql client for Windows is able to use these APIs.
# 
# The Windows installer creates an item in the MySQL menu named MySQL command line client - Unicode.
# This item invokes the mysql client with properties set to communicate through the console to
# the MySQL server using Unicode.
#
# Open the console window
# Go to console window properties - select font tab - choose Lucidia Console or some other compatible UNICODE font.
#
# This is called for, due to console windows start by default using a DOS raster font that is uncalled for Unicode.
#
# Execute mysql with --default-character-set=utf8 (or utf8mb4) option.
# It is nessecary because utf16le cannot be used as client char set, amongst others.
#
# With said changes, Windows will use the Windows API to communicate with the console using UTF-16LE,
# and communicate with the server using UTF-8.
#
# To avoid said steps each time we run mysql, we can create a shortcut that invokes mysql.exe
# The shortcut should set the console font to Lucida Console or some other compatible
# Unicode font, and pass the --default-character-set=utf8 to mysql.
#
# Alternatively, we have a shortcut for the console font - with the char set in the [mysql] group in a my.ini file:
# [mysql]
# default-character-set=utf8

# Using the --safe-updates Option
# 
# For beginners, a useful startup option is --safe-updates (or --i-am-a-dummy, which has the same effect).
# It is helpful for cases when you might have issued a DELETE FROM <tbl_name> statement, but if we forgot the Where part.
#
# By --safe-updates, we enforce key referal to commit to delete updates.
#
# The query sent upon startup is the following:
# 
# SET sql_safe_updates=1, sql_select_limit=1000, max_join_size=1mil
#
# The SET statement has the following effects:
#
# You are not permitted to execute an UPDATE or DELETE statement unless you specify a key constraint in the
# WHERE clause or provide a LIMIT clause (or both)
#
# Example:
#
# UPDATE <tbl_name> SET <not_key_column>=<val> WHERE <key_column>=<val>;
#
# UPDATE <tbl_name> SET <not_key_column>=<val> LIMIT 1;
#
# The server limits all large SELECT results to 1,000 rows unless the statement includes a LIMIT clause.
# 
# The server aborts multiple-table SELECT statements that probably need to examine more than 1 mil row combos.
#
# We can override the defaults by using --select_limit and --max_join_size options:
#
# mysql --safe-updates --select_limit=500 --max_join_size=10000
#
# Disabling mysql Auto-Reconnect
#
# If the mysql client loses its connection to the server while sending a statement, it immediately and automatically
# tries to reconnect once to the server and send the statement again.
#
# However, even if mysql succeeds in reconnecting, your first connection has ended and all your previous session objects/settings
# are lost.
#
# Temporary tables, the autocommit mode, user-defined vars and session vars.
#
# Any current transactions roll back. 
#
# An example of loss of designation:
#
# mysql> SET @a=1;
# mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(@a); #Gets error
#
# mysql> SELECT * FROM t; #a is now Null

#To terminate with an error, start mysql with --skip-reconnect

# The next section covers mysqladmin - Client to administer a MySQL server
#
# Invoked:
#
# mysqladmin [<options>] <command> [<command-arg>] [<command> [<command-arg>]] ...
#
# mysqladmin supports the following commands. Some of the commands take an argument following the cmd name:
#
# create <db_name> - creates a DB with <db_name>
# debug - Tell the server to write debug information to the error log. Connnected user must have SUPER privs.
# drop <db_name> - Delete the DB named <db_name> and all of its tables.
# extended-status - Display the server status vars and their values.
# flush-hosts - Flush all information in the host cache
#
# flush-logs [<log_type> ...] - Flush all logs. The mysqladmin flush-logs cmd permits optional log types to be given,
# to specify which logs to flush.
#
# Following the flush-logs command, you can provide a space-separated list of one or more of the following log types:
# binary, engine, error, general, relay, slow
#
# These correspond to the log types that can be specified for the <FLUSH LOGS> SQL statement.
#
# flush-privileges - Reload the grant tables (same as reload)
#
# flush-status - Clear status vars
#
# flush-tables - Flush all tables
#
# flush-threads - Flush the thread cache
#
# kill id, id, ... - Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are given, there must be no spaces in the list.
# 							To kill threads belonging to other users, the connected user must have the CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privs.
#
# password <new_pw> - Sets a new PW. This changes the PW to <new_pw> for the account that you use with mysqladmin for connecting to the server.
# 							 Thus, the next time you invoke mysqladmin (or any other client program) using the same account, you need to specify the new PW.
#
# NOTE: Setting a pw using mysqladmin should be considered <insecure>. On some systems, your PW becomes visibile to system status programs such as 
# ps that may be invoked by other users to display cmd lines. MySQL clients typically overwrite the cmd-line pw argument with 0's during init seq.
#
# There is still a brief interval during which the value is visible. Also, on some systems this overwriting strategy is ineffective and the PW
# remains visible to ps.
#
# If the <new_pw> contains spaces or other chars that are special to your cmd line, you need to enclose it with ""
# On windows, be sure to use "" rather than '', '' are not stripped from the PW.
#
# Simply use config files for PWs.
#
# ping - Check whether the server is available. The return status from mysqladmin is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not.
# Even errors produce 0 - as it does not denote that the server is offline.
#
# processlist - Show a list of active server threads. This is the same as SHOW PROCESSLIST. If Verbose is given, the output is like that
# of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST.

# reload - Reload the grant tables.
#
# refresh - Flush all tables and close and open log files.
#
# shutdown - Stop the server
#
# start-slave - Start replication on a slave server
#
# status - Display a short server status message
#
# stop-slave - Stop replication on a slave server
#
# variables - Display the server system vars and their values
#
# version - Display version info from the server
#
# All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix:
#
# mysqladmin proc stat #Prints ID, user, host, db, command, Time, State, Info
# #Also prints stats
#
# The mysqladmin status command result displays the following values:
# 
# Uptime - Number of seconds the MySQL server has been running
# Threads - Number of active threads (clients)
# Questions - The number of questions (queries) from clients since the server was started.
# Slow queries - Number of queries that have taken more than long query time seconds.
#
# Opens - The number of tables the server has opened
# Flush tables - The number of flush-*, refresh and reload commands the server has executed
# Open tables - Number of tables that currently are open

# If you execute mysqladmin shutdown when connecting to a local server using a Unix socket file, mysqladmin waits until
# the server's process ID file has been removed, to ensure that the server has stopped properly.
#
# The following options are supported in terms of mysqladmin - of which can be specified on the cmd line or in the [mysqladmin] and [client] groups of a option file.

#Next up, is mysqlcheck 
#
# The mysqlcheck client performs table maintenance: checks, repairs, optimizes and analyzes tables.
#
# Each table is locked and therefore unavailable to other sessions while it is being processed, although for
# check ops, the table is locked with a READ lock only
#
# mysqlcheck must be used when the mysqld server is running, which means that you do not have to stop the server
# to perform table maintenance.
#
# mysqlcheck uses the SQL statements CHECK TABLE, REPAIR TABLE, ANALYZE TABLE and OPTIMIZE TABLE in a convenient way for
# the user. It determines which statements to use for the operation you want to perform, then sends the statements to 
# the server to be executed.
#
# Not all storage engines do not support all four maintenance operations.
#
# Note: We are wise to make backups in terms of tables - in case of error in file parsing
#
# The three general ways of invoking mysqlchecks:
#
# mysqlcheck [<options>] <db_name> [<tbl_name ...>]
# mysqlcheck [<options>] --databases <db_name> ...
# mysqlcheck [<options>] --all-databases
#
# If the tbl name option is ommitted, or --databases or --all-databases options are used - entire DBs are checked.
#
# mysqlcheck has a special feature compared to other client programs.
# The default behavior of checking tables (--check) can be changed by renaming the binary.
#
# If you want to have a tool that repairs tables by default, you should just make a copy of mysqlcheck 
# named mysqlrepair, or make a symbolic link to mysqlcheck named mysqlrepair.
#
# The following names can be used to change mysqlcheck default behavior
#
# Command 			Meaning
# mysqlrepair 		Default option is --repair
# mysqlanalyze 	Default option is --analyze
# mysqloptimize 	Default option is --optimize

# 										  <file_name> is relative, lest explicit. Still reads .mylogin.cnf
#
# --defaults-group-suffix=<str> - Regex pattern against suffix inclusion in addition to default groupings.
#
# --extended, -e - If you are using this option to check tables, it ensures that they are 100% consistent but takes a long time.
# 						 If used in conjunction with repair - it may produce garbage as well.

# 									 For said plugin, the server does not send the public key unless requested.
#
# 									 Is ignored for accs that do not authenticate with that plugin. 
# 									 Also ignored if RSA-based PW exchange is not used, as is when clients use secure connections.
# 	
# 									 If --server-public-key-path=<file_name> is given and valid - it's > in prio over --get-server-public-key

# 									 A "login path" is an option group containing options that specify which MySQL
# 									 server to connect to and which account to authenticate as.
#
# 								    To create or modify a login path file, use the mysql_config_editor utility.
#
# --medium-check, -m 		 Do a check that is faster than a --extended operation. This finds only 99.99% of all errors,
# 									 which should be enough in most cases.
#
# --no-defaults 				 Do not read option files. Prevents errors thrown due to errornous parsing.
# 									 .mylogin.cnf is read in all cases.
#
# --optimize, -o 				 Optimize the tables
#
# --password[=<password>],  The PW to use when connecting to the server. Short option (-p) requires no space between option and PW.
#  -p [<password>] 			 If omitted, prompts afterwards for it.
#
# --pipe, -W 					 Connect to the server using a named pipe. Only applies if server supports named-pipes
#
# --plugin-dir=<dir_name> 	 The dir in which to look for plugins. Specify if --default-auth is used for auth plugin but mysqlcheck can't find it
#
# --port=<port num>,        The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection. 
#  -P <port num>
#
# --print-defaults 			 Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files.
#
# --protocol= 					 The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is useful when the other connection params
# {TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}  normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the one you want.
#
# --quick, -q 					 If you are using this option to check tables, it prevents the check from scanning the rows to check
# 								    for incorrect links. The fastest check method.
#
# 									 If attempting to repair tables, it tries only to repair the index tree.
#
# --repair, -r 				 Perform a repair that can fix almost anything except unique keys that are not unique.
#
# --secure-auth 				 REMOVED.
#
# --server-public-key-path= The path name to a file containing a client-side copy of the public key required by the server for RSA
#   <file name> 				 key pair-based PW exchange.
#
# 								    File must be in PEM format. Applies to clients that authenticate with the sha256_password or caching_sha2_password
# 									 auth plugin. Ignored for accounts that do not authenticate with one of those plugins.
#
# 									 Also ignored if RSA based PW exchange is not used, as in secure connection.
# 									 sha256_password only applies with MySQL being built with OpenSSL.
# 									 
# 									 If --server-public-key-path=<file name> is given and specified as a valid public key,
# 									 it takes precedence over --get-server-public-key
#
# --shared-memory-base-name= On Windows, the shared memory name to use - for connections made using shared memory to a local server.
# <name>  						 Defaults to MySQL. Shared name is case-sensitive.
#
# 									 Server must be started with the --shared-memory option to enable shared-memory connections.
#
# --silent, -s 				 Silent mode. Print only error messages.
#
# --skip-database=<db name> Do not include the named DB (case-sensitive) in the operations performed by mysqlcheck.
#
# --socket=<path>,  			 For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.
#  -S <path>
#
# --ssl* 						 Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and certs.
#
# --ssl-fips-mode= 			 Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side. Defines which Cryptographic ops are permitted.
# {OFF|ON|STRICT} 			 allows:
#
# 									 OFF - Disabled, ON - Enabled, STRICT - "strict" FIPS mode
#
# --tables 						 Overrides the --databases or -B option. All names following are regarded as table names.
#
# --tls-version= 				 The protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections. Comma separated list containing one or more protocol names.
#  <protocol list> 			 Protocols that can be named, depend on the SSL Lib used to Compile MySQL.
#
# --use-frm 					 For repair operations on MyISAM tables, get the table structure from the data dictionary so that the table can be repaired even
# 									 if the .MYI header is corrupted.
#
# --user=<user name>, 		 The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. 
#  -u <user_name>
#
# --verbose, -v 				 Verbose mode. Prints info about various stages of program ops.
#
# --version, -V 				 Display version info and exit.
#
# --write-binlog 				 Enabled by default, so that ANALYZE_TABLE, OPTIMIZE_TABLE, and REPAIR_TABLE statements generated by mysqlcheck are written to 
# 									 the binary log.
#
# 									 Use --skip-write-binlog to cause NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG to be added to the statements so that they are not logged.
# 									 Use --skip-write-binlog when these statements should not be sent to replication slaves or run when using the binary
# 									 logs for recovery from backup.
#
# The next section covers mysqldump
#
# The mysqldump client utility performs logical backups, producing a set of SQL statements that can be executed
# to reproduce the original database object definitions and table data. 
#
# It dumps one or more MySQL databases for backup or transfer to another SQL server.
#
# mysqldump can also generate output in CSV, text or XML.
#
# mysqldump requires at least the SELECT privlege for dumped tables, SHOW VIEW for dumped views, TRIGGER for dumped triggers
# LOCK TABLES if the --single-transaction option is not used.
#
# Certain options might require other privs as noted in the option desc.
#
# To reload a dump file, you must have the privs required to execute the statements that it contains, such as
# the appropriate CREATE privs for objects created by those statements.
#
# mysqldump output can include ALTER DATABASE statements that change the database collation.
# These may be used when dumping stored programs to preserve their char encodings.
#
# To reload a dump file containing such statements, the ALTER priv for the affected DB is required.

# For instance, a dump made by PowerShell will be in UTF16 - which is not a permitted connection char encoding.
# To account for this - use --result-file to have it written in ASCII:
#
# mysqldump [<options>] --result-file=dump.sql
#
# mysqldump advantages include the convenience and flexibility of viewing or even editing the output before restoring.
# You can clone DBs and create slight variations, kind of like branching, in a way.
#
# The backup step can take a reasonable time - however, restoring the data can be very slow because replaying
# the SQL involves disk I/O for insertion, index creation and so on.
#
# If we have a lot of tables using InnoDB tables or a mix of InnoDB and MyISAM - we can use mysqlbackup from MySQL Enterprise Backup.
#
# It has the best performance for InnoDB.
#
# Otherwise, for large scale backup operations - utilize physical allocation.
#
# mysqldump can retrieve and dump table contents row by row, or it can retrieve the entire content from a table
# and buffer it in memory before dumping it.
#
# Buffering in memory can be a problem if you are dumping large tables. To dump tables row by row, use the --quick
# option (or --opt, which enables --quick).
#
# The --quick (implicitly activated by --opt) is on by default, so to enable memory buffering - use --skip-quick
#
# If you are using a recent version of mysqldump to generate a dump to be reloaded into a very old MySQL server,
# use the --skip-opt option instead of the --opt or --extended-insert option.
#
# There is in general three ways of using mysqldump - one for a set of one or more tables, a set of one or more complete DBs,
# or an entire MySQL server -
#
# mysqldump [<options>] <db_name> [<tbl_name> ...] #Omitting table names infers to dump the entire db
# mysqldump [<options>] --databases <db_name>
# mysqldump [<options>] --all-databases

# The mysqldump command logs into a MySQL server to extract information. 
# The following options relate to how the connection interacts with the MySQL Server, local or remote:
#
# --bind-address=<ip address> - On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this option to select which interface to use for connecting to the MySQL server.
# --compress, -C - Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both support compression.
# --default-auth=<plugin> - A hint about the client-side authentication plugin to use.
# --enable-cleartext-plugin - Enable the <mysql_clear_password> cleartext authentication plugin
# --get-server-public-key - Request as per before:
#
# 									 Request from the server the public key required for RSA key pair-based PW exchange.
# 									 This option applies to clients that authenticate with the <caching_sha2_password> authentication plugin.
#              
#                           For that plugin, the server does not send the public key unless requested. This option is ignored
# 									 for accounts that do not authenticate with that plugin. Also ignored for non RSA based PWs, i.e secure connections.
#
# 									 If --server-public-key-path=<file name> is given and specifies a valid public key file - it takes precedence over
# 									 --get-server-public-key.
#
# --host=<host_name>, 		 Dump data from the MySQL server on the given host. Defaults localhost 
#  -h <host_name>
#
# --login-path=<name> 		 Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
# 									 A "login path" is an option group containing options that specify which MySQL Server
# 									 to connect to and which account to authenticate as.
#
# 									 To create or modify a login path file, use the mysql_config_editor utility.
# 									 
# --network-timeout, -M 	 Enable large tables to be dumped by setting max_allowed_packet to its maximum value
# 									 and network read and write timeouts to a large value.
#
# 									 This option is enabled by default. To disable, use --skip-network-timeout
#
# --password[=<password>],  The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option form (-p), no space req
#  -p [<password>] 			 Prompt kicks in if no pw - can specify PW in a option file
#
# --pipe, -W 					 On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. Applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections
#
# --plugin-dir=<dir_name> 	 The dir of where to look for plugins. Specify if the --default-auth option is used to specify an authentication plugin but mysqldump does not find it.
#
# --port=<port_num>, 		 The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection
# 	-P <port_num>
#
# --protocol= 					 The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. 
# {TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}
#
# --secure-auth 				 REMOVED
#
# --server-public-key-path  Same as before
#   =<file name>
#
# --socket=<path>, 			 For connections to <localhost>, the Unix socket file to use - or Windows, name of the named pipe to use 
#  -S <path>
#
# --ssl* 						 Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the server using SSL, indicate where to find SSL keys and Certs.
#
# --ssl-fips-mode= 			 Whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side. Which cryptographic ops are permitted.
#  {OFF|ON|STRICT} 			 OFF: Disable FIPS mode. ON: Enable FIPS mode. STRICT: Enable "strict" FIPS mode.
#
# --tls-version= 				 The protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections. 
# <protocol list> 			 The value is a comma-separated list containing one or more protocol names. Allowed values depend on the SSL lib used to Compile MySQL.
#
# --user=<user_name>, 		 User name to use for connecting
#  -u <user_name>
#
# --max_allowed_packet= 	 Maximum size of the buffer for client/server comm. Defaults to 24MB, max is 1GB.
#   <value>
#
# --net_buffer_length 		 The initial size of the buffer for client/server communication. When creating multiple-row INSERT
# 									 statements (as with the --extended-insert or --opt option), mysqldump creates rows up to <net_buffer_length>
# 									 bytes long. If we increase this, the MySQL Server in terms of net_buffer_length, must be at least this large.
#
# The following options pertain to option files and which option files to read:
# 
# --defaults-extra-file=<file name> - Same as before, read before user option file on unix but after global, permissions, etc.
# --defaults-file=<file name> - Use only given option. Relative if relative, still use .mylogin.cnf - error if inaccessible.
# --defaults-group-suffix=<str> - Regex match against suffix in grouping 
# --print-defaults - Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files.
#
# Scenarios of where you'd use mysqldump include setting up an entire new MySQL instance (including DB tables), and replacing
# data inside an existing instance with existing DBs and tables.
#
# The following options let you specify which things to tear down and what to set up when restoring a dump - by utilizing
# DDL statements in the dump file.
#
# --add-drop-database - Write a <DROP DATABASE> statement before each <CREATE DATABASE> statement. 
# 							   Usually used with a --all-databases or --databases option
# --add-drop-table 	 - Write a <DROP TABLE> statement before each <CREATE TABLE> statement.
# --add-drop-trigger  - Write a <DROP TRIGGER> statement before each <CREATE TRIGGER> statement.
#
# --all-tablespaces,  - Adds to a table dump all SQL statements needed to create any tablespaces used by an NDB table.
#                       Otherwise not included from mysqldump, only relevant to NDB cluster tables, not supported by MySQL 8.0
# --no-create-db, -n  - Suppress the <CREATE DATABASE> statements that are otherwise included in the output if the --databases
#                       or --all-databases option is given.
#
# --no-create-info,   - Do not write <CREATE TABLE> statements that create each dumped table.
#  -t 						This option does not exclude statements creating log file groups or tablespaces from mysqldump output.
# 								However, you can use the --no-tablespaces option for this.
#
# --replace 				Write REPLACE statements rather than INSERT statements.
# 
# The following options pertain to debuging
#
# --allow-keywords - Permit creation of column names that are keywords. This works by prefixing each column name with the table name.
# --comments, -i 	 - Write additional information in the dump file such as program version,server version and host.
# 							This option is enabled by default. To suppress this additional information, use --skip-comments.
# --debug 				 
# [=<debug_options>], Writes a debugging log. A typical <debug_options> string is d:t:o, <file_name>. Defaults to d:t:o, /tmp/mysqldump.trace
#-# [<debug options>]	
#
# --debug-check 	 - Print some debugging information when the program exits
# --debug-info 	 - Print debugging information, memory and CPU stats when the program exits.
# --dump-date 		 - If the --comments option is given, mysqldump produces a comment at the end of the dump of the following form:
# 							-- Dump completed on <DATE>
# 						
# 						   However, the date causes dump files taken at different times to appear to be different, even if data is identical.
# 							--dump-date and --skip-dump-date control whether the date is added to the comment.
# 							Defaults to --dump-date (include date in comment), --skip-dump-date to suppress
#
# --force, -f 		 - Ignore all errors, continue even if an SQL error occurs during a table dump.
# 							Can for instance ignore view errornous referential addresses - if underlying table has been dropped.
#
# 							Without --force, mysqldump exits with an error message.
# 						   --force causes mysqldump to print the error message - but also writes an SQL comment
# 							containing the view definition to the dump output and continues executing.
#
# 							If --ignore-error is also given, --force takes higher prio
#
# --log-error= 		Log warnings and errors by appending them to the named file. Defaults to no logging.
#	<file_name>
#
# --skip-comments 	See the description for the --comments options
#
# --verbose, -v 		Verbose mode
#
# The following options pertain to some help options
#
# --help, -? - Display a help message and exit
# --version, -V - Display version info and exit
#
# The following options pertain to char sets in relation to national language settings
#
# --character-sets-dir=<dir_name> - The dir where character sets are installed.
# --default-character-set= 		 - Use <charset_name> as default char set. If none specified, defaults to UTF8.
#  <charset_name>
# --no-set-names, -N 				 - Turns off the --set-charset setting, the same as specifying --skip-set-charset
# --set-charset 						 - Write SET NAMES <default character set> to the output. Enabled by default. 
# 												To suppress the SET NAMES, use --skip-set-charset
#
# The following options pertain to Replication and akin
#
# The mysqldump command is frequently used to create an empty instance, or an instance including data, on a slave server
# in a replication configuration.
#
# The following options apply to dumping and restoring data on replication master and slave servers:
#
# --apply-slave-statements - For a slave dump produced with the --dump-slave option, add a STOP SLAVE statement before the
# 									  CHANGE MASTER TO statement and a START SLAVE statement at the end of the output.
#
# --delete-master-logs 		- On a master replication server, delete the binary logs by sending a PURGE BINARY LOGS statement to the server
# 									  after performing the dump operation. Automatically enables --master-data.
#
# --dump-slave[=<value>] 	- Similar to --master-data except that it is used to dump a replication slave server to produce a dump file
# 									  that can be used to set up another server as a slave that has the same master as the dumped server.
#
# 									  It causes the dump output to include a CHANGE MASTER TO statement that indicates the binary log coords
# 									  (file name and pos) of the dumped slave's master.
#
# 									  The CHANGE MASTER TO statement reads the values of Relay_Master_Log_File and Exec_Master_Log_Pos
# 									  from the SHOW SLAVE STATUS output and uses them for MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS respectively.
#
# 									  Thoose are the master server coords to which the slave is to replicate from.
#
# 									  NOTE: Inconsistencies in the sequence of transactions from the relay log which have been executed can
# 									  cause the wrong coords to be used.
#
# 									  This option causes the coords from the master to be used rather than those of the dumped server, as is 
# 									  done by the --master-data option.
#
# 									  In addition - specifying this option causes the --master-data option to be overridden, if used, and ignored.
#
#  								  WARNING: Do not use in conjunction with dumped server coords which yields gtid mode=ON and MASTER_AUTOPOSITION=1
#
#  								  The option value is handled the same way as for --master-data:
#                            no value or 1 - Causes a CHANGE MASTER TO statement to be written to the dump
# 									  2 - Causes the statement to be written but encased in SQL comments (same effect as --master-data 
# 									  in enabling or disabling other options and in how locking is handled)
#
# 									  This option causes mysqldump to stop the slave SQL thread before the dump and restart it again after.
# 									  With --dump-slave - the --apply-slave-statements and --include-master-host-port options can also be used.
#
# --include-master-host-port For the CHANGE MASTER TO statement in a slave dump produced with --dump-slave option, add MASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT
# 									  options for the host name and TCP/IP port number of the slave's master.
#
# --master-data[=<value>] 	  Use this option to dump a master replication server to produce a dump file that can be used to set up another server
# 									  as a slave of the master.
#
# 									  Causes the dump output to include a CHANGE_MASTER_TO statement that indicates the binary log coords (file name and pos) 
# 									  of the dumped server. Said coords are the master server coords from which the slave should start replicating after the dump
# 									  is loaded into the slave.
# 							
# 									  If the option value is 2 - the CHANGE_MASTER_TO statement is written as an SQL comment, and is informative only.
# 									  Has no effect when the dump file is reloaded.
#
# 									  If the option value is 1 - the statement is not written as a comment and takes effect when the dump file is reloaded.
# 									  If none is specified - it defaults to 1.
#
# 									  Requires the RELOAD privilege and the binary log must be enabled.
#
# 									  The --master-data option automatically turns off --lock-tables. 
# 									  Also turns on --lock-all-tables, unless --single-transaction also is specified.
# 									  If --single-transaction is also specified - a global read lock is acquired only for a short time
# 									  at the beginning of the dump.
#
# 									  Any action on logs happens at the exact moment of the dump.
# 									  We can also set up a slave by dumping an existing slave of the master, using the --dump-slave option
# 									  - overriding the --master-data - causing both to be ignored.
#
# --set-gtid-purged=<value>  Enables control over global transaction ID (GTID) information written to the dump file, by indicating whether
# 									  to add a SET @@global.gtid purged statement to the output.
#
# 									  May also cause a statement to be written to the output that disables binary logging while the dump file is being
# 									  reloaded.
#
# 									  Default: AUTO.
#									  OFF  : Add no SET statement to the output.
# 									  ON   : Add a SET statement to the output. An error occurs if GTIDs are not enabled on the server.
# 								     AUTO : Add a SET statement to the output if GTIDs are enabled on the server.
#
# 									  A partial dump from a server that is using GTID-based replication requires the --set-gtid-purged={ON|OFF} option
# 									  to be specified.

# 									  If we wish to deploy a new replication slave using only some of the data from the dumped server, use ON.

# 									  If we wish to repair the table in terms of copying within a topology or copy between disjoint topologies
# 									  of which remain so - Use OFF.
# 
# 									  The --set-gtid-purged option has the following effect on binary logging when the dump file is reloaded:
#
# 									  --set-gtid-purged=OFF : SET @@SESSION.SQL_LOG_BIN=0; is not added to the output.
# 									  --set-gtid-purged=ON  : SET @@SESSION.SQL_LOG_BIN=0; is added to the output
# 									  --set-gtid-purged=AUTO: SET @@SESSION.SQL_LOG_BIN=0; is added to the output if GTIDs are enabled on the server you are backing up. (If AUTO evalutes to ON)
#
# 									  NOTE: It is not recommended to load a dump file when GTIDs are enabled on the server (gtid mode=ON), if your dump file
# 									  includes system tables.
#
# 								     mysqldump issues DML instructions for the system tables which use the non-transactional MyISAM storage engine,
#								     and this combination is not permitted when GTIDs are enabled.
#
# 									  Also be aware that loading a dump file from a server with GTIDs enabled - into another server with GTIDs enabled -
# 									  causes different transaction identifiers to be generated.
# 
# The following options specify how to represent the entire dump file or certain kinds of data in the dump file.
# They also control whether certain optional info is written to the dump file:
#
# --compact - Produce more compact output. This option enables the --skip-add-drop-table, --skip-add-locks, --skip-comments,
# 																						 --skip-disable-keys, --skip-set-charset options.
# --compatible=<name> - Produce output that is more compatible with other database systems or with older MySQL servers.
# 								Only permitted value for this is ansi - has the same meaning as for the Server SQL mode option.
# --complete-insert, -c Use complete INSERT statements that include column names
#
# --create-options 		Include all MySQL-specific table options in the CREATE TABLE statements.
#
# --fields-terminated-by=<...>, 				Options used with the --tab option and have the same meaning as the corresponding FIELDS
# --fields-enclosed-by=<...>, 				clauses for LOAD DATA INFILE.
# --fields-optionally-enclosed-by=<...>,
# --fields-escaped-by=<...>
#
# --hex-blob 				Dump binary columns using hexadecimal notation ('abc' becomes 0x616263).
# 								Affected data types are BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB types and BIT.
#
# --lines-terminated-by=<...> 				Used with the --tab option and has the same meaning as the corresponding LINES clause for LOAD DATA INFILE.
#
# --quote-names, -Q 		Quote identifiers, such as DB, table and column names - within ` chars. If the ANSI_QUOTES SQL mode is on, identifiers are quoted with "
# 								Enabled by default. Can be disabled with --skip-quote-names, but this option should be given after any option such as --compatible that may
# 								enable --quote-names. i.e - Order this command after others
#
# --result-file= 		   Direct output to the named file. Result file is created and its previous contents overwritten, even if an error occurs while generating dump.
#  <file_name>, 			Used on Windows to prevent \n from becoming \r\n
#
# --tab=<dir_name>, 	   Produce tab-separated text-format data files. For each dumped table, mysqldump creates a <tbl_name>.sql file that contains 
#  -T <dir_name> 			the CREATE TABLE statements - of which create the table and the server writes a <tbl_name>.txt that contains its data.
# 								The option value is the dir in which to write the files.
#
# 								NOTE: Should only be used when mysqldump is run on the same machine as the mysqld server.
# 										The server creates *.txt files in the dir that we specify - the dir must be writable by the server
# 										and the MySQL acc that we use must have the FILE privs.
#
# 									   Because mysqldump creates *.sql in the same dir, it must be writable by the system login acc.
#
# 								By default - the .txt data files are formatted using tab chars between column values and a newline at the end of each line.
# 								The format can be specified explicitly using the --fields-<xxx> and --lines-terminated-by options.
#
# 								Column values are converted to the character set specified by the --default-character-set option.
#
# --tz-utc 					Enables TIMESTAMP columns to be dumped and reloaded between servers in different time zones.
# 								mysqldump sets its connection time zone to UTC and adds SET TIME_ZONE='+00:00' to the dump file.
# 			
# 								Without this - TIMESTAMP columns are dumped and reloaded in the time zones local to the source and
# 								destination servers - Which causes discrepencies in values if the servers are in different timezones.
#
# 								Also protects against changes due to daylight saving time.
# 								Enabled by default - disable with --skip-tz-utc
#
# --xml, -X 				
#  -r <file_name> 		Write dump output as well-formed XML.
#
# 								The following example showcases the differences:
# 								VALUE: 									XML Representation:
# 								NULL(unknown value) 					<field name="column_name" xsi:nil="true" />
# 								''(empty strting) 					<field name="column_name"></field>
# 								'NULL'(string value) 				<field name="column_name">NULLL</field>
#
# 								An example of mysqldump can be showcased as follows:

#
# 
# The following options pertain to filtering in terms of Schema objects being written to dump files, sorted by:
# Category
# triggers/events
# names to be dumped
# Filtering based on WHERE
#
# --all-databases, -A - Dump all the tables in all of the DBs. Same as using --databases on cmd line
# 								To include routines and events in terms of > 8.0, use --routines and --events in addition to the --all-databases
# 								The reason for this - is that the mysql.event and mysql.proc tables are not used.
#
# 								< 8.0, the system DB included the mysql.proc and mysql.event tables with the routines and event defs
#
# --databases, -B 	 - Dump several DBs. Normally - mysqldump treats each name past the first as tables. This treats all names as DBs.
# 								This can be used to dump the performance_schema DB, not normally dumped with --all-databases
# 								(Also use the --skip-lock-tables)
#
# --events, -E 		 - Include Event Scheduler events for the dumped databases in the output. This option requires the EVENT privs for those DBs.
# 								The output generated by using --events contains CREATE EVENT statements to create the events.
#
# --ignore-error= 		Ignore the specified errors. The option value is a comma-separated list of error numbers specifying the errors to ignore
#   <error>[,<error>].. during mysqldump execution.
#
# 								If the --force option is also given to ignore all errors, --force takes precedence.
#
# --ignore-table= 		Do not dump the given table, which must be specified using both the DB and Table names.
#   <db_name>.<tbl_name> To ignore multiple tables, use this option multiple times. Can also be used to ignore views.
#
# --no-data, -d 			Do not write any table row info (that is, do not dump the table contents). This is useful if you want to dump
# 								only the CREATE TABLE statement for the table (For example - to create a empty copy of the table by loading the dump file)
#
# --routines, -R 			Include stored routines (procedures and functions) for the dumped databases in the output. This option requires the global
# 								SELECT priv.
#
# 								The output generated by using --routines contains CREATE_PROCEDURE and CREATE_FUNCTION statements to create the routine.
# 
# --tables 					Override the --databases or -B option. mysqldump regards all name arguments following the option as table names.
#
# --triggers 				Include triggers for each dumped table in the output. This option is enabled by default; disable it with --skip-triggers
#
# 								To be able to dump a table's triggers - you must have the TRIGGER priv for the table.
#
# 								Multiple triggers are permitted. mysqldump dumps triggers in activation order so that when the dump file is reloaded,
# 								triggers are created in the same activation order. 
#
# 								If a mysqldump file contains multiple triggers for a table that have the same trigger event and action time,
# 								an error occurs to load the dump file into a older server that does not support multiple triggers.
#
# --where= 					Dump only rows selected by the given <WHERE> condition. Quotes around the condition are mandatory if it contains
#  <WHERE CONDITION>  	spaces or other chars that are special to your cmd interpreter (Just escape with ""'s)
#  -w <WHERE CONDITION>
#
# The following options pertain to performance options related to restore operations.
# For large data sets - restore operations (processing the INSERT statements in the dump file) takes a lot of time (or most)
# 
# Performance is also influenced by the transactional options, primarily for the dump operation.
#
# --column-statistics - Add <ANALYZE TABLE> statements to the output to generate histogram stats for dumped tables when the dump file is reloaded.
# 								This option is disabled by default because histogram generation for large tables takes a long time.
#
# --disable-keys, -K  - For each table - surround the <INSERT> statements with /*!40000 ALTER TABLE <tbl_name> DISABLE KEYS */;
# 																										 /*!40000 ALTER TABLE <tbl_name> ENABLE KEYS */;
#
# 								This makes loading the dump files faster because the indexes are created after all rows are inserted.
#								Effective only for nonunique indexes of MyISAM tables.
#
# --extended-insert,  - Write <INSERT> statements using multiple-row syntax that includes several VALUES lists.
#  -e  						Results in a smaller dump file and speeds up inserts when the file is reloaded.
#
# --insert-ignore 	 - Write <INSERT IGNORE> statements rather than <INSERT> statements.
#
# --opt 					 - This option, enabled by default - is short hand for: 
# 											--add-drop-table --add-locks --create-options
# 											--disable-keys --extended-insert --lock-tables
# 											--quick --set-charset
#
# 								It's basically a fast dump.
# 								Since --opt is default, running --skip-opt just turns off several defaults.
#
# --quick, -q 			 - Useful for dumping large tables. Forces mysqldump to retrieve rows for a table from the
# 								server a row at a time rather than retrieving the entire row set and buffering it in memory before writing it out.
#
# --skip-opt 			 - Read --opt 
#
# The following options pertain to trade off between speed, reliability and consistency of the exported data.
#
# --add-locks 			- Surround-each table dump with LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES statements.
# 							  Results in faster inserts when dump file is reloaded.
#
# --flush-logs,  		-  Flush the MySQL server log files before starting the dump. This option requires the RELOAD priv.
#  -F 					 	If you use this option in combo with the --all-databases option - the logs are flushed
# 								for each DB dumped.
#
# 								The exception is when using --lock-all-tables, --master-data or --single-transaction.
# 								In this case, the logs are flushed only once - corresponding to the moment that all tables
# 								are locked by <FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK>.
#
# 								If you want your dump and the log flush to happen at exactly the same moment - you should use
# 								--flush-logs together with --lock-all-tables, --master-data, or --single-transaction.
#
# --flush-privileges 	Adds a FLUSH PRIVILEGES statement to the dump output after dumping the mysql database.
# 								This option should be used any time the dump contains the mysql DB and any other DB that depends
# 								on the data in the mysql db for proper restoration.
#
# 								For > 5.7.2 - do not use --flush-privileges.
#
# --lock-all-tables, 	Lock all tables across all databases. This is achieved by acquiring a global read lock for the
#  -x  						duration of the whole dump.
#
# 								This option automatically turns off --single-transaction and --lock-tables
# 
# --lock-tables, -l 		For each dumped database, lock all tables to be dumped before dumping them.
# 								The tables are locked with READ LOCAL to permit concurrent inserts in the case
# 								of MyISAM tables.
#
# 								For transactional tables such as InnoDB, --single-transaction is a much better option
# 								than --lock-tables because it does not need to lock the tables at all.
#
# 								Because --lock-tables locks tables for each DB separately, this option does not guarantee
# 								that the tables in the dump file are logically consistent between DBs.
#
# 								Tables in different DBs may be dumped in different states.
#
# 								Some options such as --opt automatically enable --lock-tables.
# 								If you want to override this  - use --skip-lock-tables at the end of the options list.
# 								
# --no-autocommit 		Enclose the INSERT statements for each dumped table within SET autocommit = 0 and COMMIT statements.
#
# --order-by-primary 	Dump each table's rows sorted by it's primary key - or by its first unique index - if such an index exists.
# 								This is useful when dumping a MyISAM table to be loaded into an InnoDB table, but makes the dump operation
# 								take a lot more time.
#
# --shared-memory- 		On Windows, the shared-memory name to use - for connections made using shared memory to a local server.
#  base-name=<name> 		The default value is MySQL. The shared-memory name is case-sensitive.
#
# 								Server must be started with the --shared-memory to enable shared-memory connections
#
# --single-transaction 	This option sets the transaction isolation mode to REPEATABLE READ and sends a START TRANSACTION SQL statement
# 								to the server before dumping data. It is useful only with transactional tables such as InnoDB - because it
# 								dumps the consistent state of the DB at the time of when START TRANSACTION was issued without blocking
# 								any apps.
#
# 								When using this option - you should keep in mind that only InnoDB tables are dumped in a consistent state.
# 								For example, any MyISAM or MEMORY tables dumped while using this option may still change state.
#
# 								While a --single-transaction dump is in process, to ensure a valid dump file (correct table contents and binary log coords)
# 								no other connection should use the following statements:
#
# 								ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, RENAME TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE
#
# 								A consistent read is not isolated from those statements - so use of them on a table to be dumped
# 								can cause the SELECT that is performed by mysqldump to retrieve the table contents to obtain incorrect contents or fail.
#
# 								The --single-transaction option and the --lock-tables option are mutually exclusive because LOCK TABLES causes any
# 								pending transactions to be committed implicitly.
#
# 								To dump larger tables - combine the --single-transaction option with the --quick option.
#
# The following are some examples:
#
# Backup of an entire DB:
#
# mysqldump <db_name> > backup-file.sql
#
# To load the dump file back into the server:
#
# mysql <db_name> < backup-file.sql
#
# Another way to reload the dump file:
#
# mysql -e "source /path-to-backup/backup-file.sql" <db_name>
#
# mysqldump can also populate other DBs by copying data from one MySQL server to another:
#
# mysqldump --opt <db_name> | mysql --host=<remote_host> -C <db_name>
#
# We can also dump several DBs with one comment:
#
# mysqldump --databases <db_name1> [<db_name2> ...] > <my_databases.sql>
#
# We can also direct flow of output to a sql file :
# mysqldump --all-databases > all_databases.sql
#
# For InnoDB tables, mysqldump provides a way of making a online backup:
#
# mysqldump --all-databases --master-data --single-transaction > all_databases.sql
#
# This backup acquires global read lock on all tables (using the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK) at the beginning of the dump.
# As soon as the lock has been aquired - the binary log co-ords are read and the lock is released.
#
# If long updating statements are running when the FLUSH statement is issued - the MySQL server may get stalled
# until said statements finish.
#
# After that - the dump becomes lock free and does not disturb reads and writes on the tables. If the update statements
# that the MySQL server receives are short (in terms of execution time) - the initial lock period should not be noticable.
#
# If we are interested in point-in-time recovery (known as "roll-forward" - when we need to restore an old backup and replay the changes that
# 																  happened since that backup) - it is useful to rotate the binary log - or at least know the binary log co-ords
# 																  to which the dump corresponds:
#
# mysqldump --all-databases --master-data=2 > all_databases.sql
#
# OR
#
# mysqldump --all-databases --flush-logs --master-data=2 > all_databases.sql
#
# The --master-data and --single-transaction options can be used at the same time - which provides a convenient way to make a online
# backup suitable for use prior to point-in-time recovery if tables are used with InnoDB as a storage engine.
#
# Mysqldump does not dump the performance_schema or sys schema by default. To dump any of these - name them explicitly  on the cmd line.
# You can also name them with the --databases option. For performance_schema - also use the --skip-lock-tables option.
#
# mysqldump does not dump the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema
#
# mysqldump does not dump InnoDB CREATE TABLESPACE statements
#
# mysqldump includes statements to recreate the <general_log> and <slow_query_log> tables for dumps of the mysql database.
# Log table contents are not dumped.
#
# The following options section pertains to mysqlimport - which is used for data imports.
#
# The mysqlimport client provides a CMD line interface to the LOAD DATA INFILE SQL statement.
# Most options to mysqlimport correspond directly to clauses of LOAD DATA INFILE syntax.
#
# To invoke mysqlimport, the syntax is generally:
#
# mysqlimport [<options>] <db_name> <textfile1> [<textfile2>]
#
# For each text file named on the cmd line - mysqlimport strips any extension from the file name and uses
# the result to determine the name of the table into which to import the file's contents.
#
# For example - files named patient.txt, patient.text and patient all would be imported into a table called patient.
#
# We can define the following options on the cmd line or the [mysqlimport] and [client] groups of an option file.
#
# 		FORMAT 											Desc

#
# --ignore, -i 						 - --replace, basically
#
# --ignore-lines=<N> 				 - Ignore the N first lines of hte data file
#
# --lines-terminated-by=<...> 	 - This option has the same meaning as the corresponding clause for LOAD DATA INFILE.
# 												For example - to import Windows files that have lines terminated with carriage return/linefeed pairs,
# 												use --lines-terminated-by="\r\n".
#
# --local, -L 							 - Default, files are read by the server on the server host. With this option, mysqlimport reads input files locally
# 												on the client host. Enabling local data loading also requires that the server permits it.
#
# --lock-tables, -l 					 - Lock all tables for writing before processing any text files. Ensures that all tables are synched on the server.
#
# --login-path=<name> 				 - Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
# 												A "login path" is an option group containing options that specify which MySQL server to connect to
# 												and which acc to auth as. Used with mysql_config_editor
#
# --low-priority 						 - Use LOW_PRIORITY when loading the table. This affects only storage engines that use only table-level locking
# 												(such as MyISAM, MEMORY, and MERGE)
#
# --no-defaults 						 - Same as other no-defaults
#
# SKIP A FEW BECAUSE REPEAT
#
# --replace, -r 						  - The --replace and --ignore options control handling of input rows that duplicate existing rows on unique key values.
# 												 If given - new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key value.
# 												 --ignore skips - If neither is given, an error occurs when running into a duplication and ignores the rest of the file.
#
# //SKIPPED REPEATAL
#
# --use-threads=<N> 						- Load files in parallel using <N> threads
#

# The following section covers mysqlpump - which breaks down DBs etc. into logical backups, which comes in the form of
# a set of SQL statements that can rebuild the system you broke down.
#
# Can dump one or several DBs.
#
# The features covers things akin to:
#
# Parallel processing of DBs, and of objects within DBs
# Better control over which DB and DB objects (tables, stored programs, user accs) to dump
# Dumping of user accs as account-management statements (CREATE USER, GRANT) - rather than as inserts into the mysql DB
# 
# Capability of creating compressed output
# Progress indicator (estimates)
# In terms of dump file reloading, faster secondary index creation for InnoDB tables by adding indexes after rows are inserted
#
# mysqlpump requires at least the SELECT privilege for dumped tables, SHOW VIEW for dumped views, TRIGGER for dumped triggers
# LOCK TABLES if the --single-transaction option is not used
#
# The SELECT priv on the mysql system db is required to dump user defs. Certain options might require other privs
# as noted in the option desc.
#
# To reload a dump file - you must have the privs reqed to execute the statements that it contains - such as appropiate CREATE privs
# for objects created by said statements.
#
# When dumping, use --result-file to circumvent UTF-16 encoding
#
# mysqlpump [<options>] > dump.sql #UTF-16, not allowed as server conn Char set
#
# mysqlpump [<options>] --result-file=dump.sql
#
# By default, mysqlpump dumps all the DBs, except a few. Can use --all-databases to do all
#
# To dump more specifically - following syntax holds:
#
# mysqlpump <db_name>
# mysqlpump <db_name> <tbl_name1, tbl_name2>
#
# To treat all name args as DB names - use the --databases option:
#
# mysqlpump --databases <db_name1, db_name2>
#
# By default, mysqlpump does not dump user acc defs - even if you dump the mysql system DB that contains the grant tables.
# To dump grant table contents as logical definitions in the form of CREATE USER and GRANT statements - use the --users option
# and suppress all DB dumping
#
# mysqlpump --exclude-databases=% --users
#
# The % above is wildchar regex against any name sequence in the context above
#
# mysql has different options for including/excluding DBs, tables, stored programs and user defs.
#
# To reload a dump file - execute the statements that it contains. For instance:
#
# mysqlpump [<options>] > dump.sql
# mysql < dump.sql

# --add-drop-user - Write a DROP USER statement before each CREATE USER statement
#
# --add-locks - Surround each table dump with LOCK_TABLES and UNLOCK_TABLES statements. Causes faster inserts when dump is loaded
#
# 					 Does not work with parallelism because INSERT statements from different tables can be interleaved,
# 					 UNLOCK TABLES following the end of the inserts for one table could release locks on tables for which inserts remain.
#
# 					 i.e - --add-locks and --single-transaction are mutually exclusive
#
# --all-databases, - Dump all databases. Exclusive towards --databases. Defaults to dumping all, except few.
#  -A
#
# 							< MySQL 8.0 - includes mysql system db, also mysql.proc and mysql.event tables - with routines and events
# 							>= MySQL 8.0 - mysql.event and mysql.proc tables are not used. To include, use --routines and -events explicitly
#
# --bind-address   - On a computer having multiple network interfaces - use this option to select which interface to use for connecting to the MySQL server 
#  =<ip address>
#
# --character-sets-dir - The dir where char sets are installed
#  =<path>
#
# --column-statistics - Add ANALYZE TABLE statements to the output to generate histogram statistics for dumped tables when the dump file is reloaded.
# 								This option is disabled by default because histogram generation for large tables can take a long time.
#
# --complete-insert 	 - Write complete INSERT statements that include column names
#
# --compress, -C 		 - Compress all information sent between the client and server if both support compression
#
# --compress-output=  - By default, mysqlpump does not compress output. This option specifies output compressiion using the specified algo.
#  <algorithm> 		   Permitted are LZ4 and ZLIB.
#
# 								To uncompress compressed output - you must have an appropiate utility. If the system commands iz4 and openssl zlib are not about,
# 								MySQL includes iz4_decompress and zlib_decompress utilities that can be used to decompress mysqlpump output that was
# 								compressed using the --compress-output=LZ4 and --compress-output=ZLIB.
#
# --databases, -B 	 - Normally, mysqlpump treats the first name arg on the cmd line as a db name and any following names as table names.
# 								With this option - it treats all name args as db names. CREATE DATABASE statements are included in the output before
# 								each new DB.
#
# 								--all-databases and --databases are exclusive.
#
# --debug[=<debug options>] - Write a debugging log. A typical <debug_options> is d:t:o, <file_name>. Defaults to d:t:O, /tmp/mysqlpump.trace
#  -# [<debug_options>
#
# --debug-check - Print some debugging when the program exits
#
# --debug-info, -T - Print debugging info, memory and stats usage when the program exits.
#
# --default-auth - Hint about the client-side auth plugin to use 
#  =<plugin>
#
# --default-character-set= - Use <charset_name> as the default char set - if none specified, defaults to UTF8
#   <charset_name>
#
# --default-parallelism=<N> - The default number of threads for each parallel processing queue. Defaults to 2.
#
# 										--parallel-schemas also affects parallelism - and can be used to override the default numbers of threads.
#
# 										If we use --default-parallelism=0 and no --parallel-schemas - mysqlpump runs a single-threaded process and 
# 										creates no queues.
# 	
#  									With parallelism enabled - it is possible for output from different databases to be interleaved
#
# --defaults-extra-file=    - Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix) before the user option file.
#   <file name> 					Relative if relative, absolute if absolute - failure to access throws an error
#
# --defaults-file= 			 - Use only the given option file. If it does not exist or cannot be accessed - error is thrown.
#   <file name> 					.mylogin.cnf is still read
#
# 										Relative if relative, absolute if absolute etc.
#
# --defaults-group-suffix=  - Regex match against suffix in groupings
#  <str>
#
# --defer-table-indexes 	 - In the dump output, defer index creation for each table until after its rows have been loaded.
# 										This works for all storage engines - but for InnoDB applies only for secondary indexes.
#
# 										Enabled by default, --skip-defer-tables-indexes to disable.
#
# --events 							Include Event Scheduler events for the dumped databases in the output. 
# 										Event dumping requires the EVENT privs for those DBs.
#
# 										The output generated by using --events contains CREATE EVENT statements to create the events.
# 										On by default - use --skip-events to disable it
#
# --exclude-databases= 		 - Do not dump the DBs in said list. This option stacks.
#  <db_list>
#
# --exclude-events= 			 - Do not dump the DBs in <event list>. Stacks.
#  <event_list>
#
# --exclude-routines/tables/triggers/users - Do not dump events/tables/triggers/users in said list. Stacks.
#
# --extended-insert=<N> 	 - Write INSERT statements using multiple-row syntax that includes several VALUES lists.
# 										Results in smaller dump file and speeds up inserts when the file is reloaded.
#
# 										Option value indicates number of rows to include in each INSERT statement. Defaults to 250.
# 										This means the total of 250 rows are bound to a INSERT statement in terms of list relation.
#
# --hex-blob 					-  Binary colums are converted to hexadecimal. BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB and BIT are affected.
#
# --host=<host name>,      -  Dump data from the MySQL server on the given host.
#  -h <host name>
#
# --include-databases/events/routines/tables/triggers/user= Dump the databases/events/routines/tables/triggers/users in the respective list. Stacks. 		-  
# 	 <db_list>
#
# --insert-ignore 			- Write INSERT IGNORE instead of INSERT statements.
#
# --log-error-file= 			- Log warnings and errors by appending them to the named file. If this option is not given, mysqlpump writes warnings and 
# 									  errors to the std error output.
#
# --login-path=<name> 		- Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
# 									  A "login path" is an option group containing options that specify which MySQL
# 									  to connect to and which acc to auth as. Create or modify with mysql_config_editor
#
# --max-allowed-packet=<N> - Max size of the buffer for client/server comm. Defaults to 24MB, max to 1gb
#   <file name>
#
# --net-buffer-length=<N>  - The initial size of the buffer for client/server comm. When creating multiple-row INSERT 
# 									  statements (as with the --extended-insert) - mysqlpump creates rows up to <N> bytes long.
#
# 									  If you use this option to increase the value - ensure that the MySQL server <net buffer length>
# 									  system var has a value at least this large.
#
# --no-create-db 				- Suppress any <CREATE DATABASE> statements that might otherwise be included in the output.
#
# --no-create-info, -t 		- Do not write <CREATE TABLE> statements that create each dumped table
#
# --parallel-schemas=[<N:> - Create a queue for processing the DBs in db_list. If N is given, the queue uses N threads.
#  <db list>] 					  If N is not defined - --default-parallelism defines the number of queue threads.
#
# 									  Multiple instances of this option creates multiple queues. Also creates a default queue to use
# 									  for DBs not named in any --parallel-schemas option - and for dumping user definitions if command
# 									  options select them.
#
# --password[=<password>], - The PW to use for connecting to the server. If -p is used - cannot have space between designation.
#  -p [<password>] 			  
#
# --plugin-dir=<dir name>  - The dir where to look for plugins. Specify this option if the --default-auth option is used to specify
# 									  an auth plugin but mysqlpump doesn ot find it.
#
# --port=<port num>, 	   - The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection
#  -P <port_num>
#
# --print-defaults 			- Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files
#
# --protocol= 					- Protocol to use
#  {TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}
#
# --replace 					- Write REPLACE statements rather than INSERT statements
#
# --result-file=<file name>- Direct output to the named file. Result file is created and its previous contents overwritten,
# 									  even if an error occurs while generating the dump.
#
# 									  Should be used on Windows to prevent \n from being converted to \r\n
#
# --routines 					- Include stored routines (procedures and functions) for the dumped DB in the output.
# 									  Requires the global SELECT priv.
#
# 									  output generated by using --routines contains CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION statements to 
# 									  create the routines.
#
# 									  Enabled by default, use --skip-routines to disable it.
#
# --secure-auth 				- REMOVED
#
# --set-gtid-purged=<value>- Enables control over global transaction ID (GTID) info written to the dump file, by indicating whether
# 									  to add a SET @@global.gtid purged statement to the output.
#
# 									  This option may also cause a statement to be written to the output that disables binary logging
# 									  while the dump file is being reloaded.
#
# 									  Defaults: AUTO
# 									  OFF --> No SET statement in the output
# 									  ON  --> Add a SET statement to the output. Error occurs if GTIDs are not enabled on the server.
# 									  AUTO -> Add a SET statement to the output if GTIDs are enabled on the server.
#
# 									  The --set-gtid-purged option has the following effect on binary logging when the dump file is reloaded:
#
# 									  --set-gtid-purged=OFF:SET @@SESSION.SQL_LOG_BIN=0; is not added to the output
# 									  --set-gtid-purged=ON:SET @@SESSION.SQL_LOG_BIN=0; is added to the output
# 									  --set-gtid-purged=AUTO:SET @@SESSION.SQL_LOG_BIN=0; is added to the output if GTIDs are enabled on the server
# 									  you are backing up (that is - if AUTO is evaluated as ON)
#
# --single-transaction 		- Sets the transaction isolation mode to REPEATABLE READ and sends a START TRANSACTION SQL statement to the server before dumping data.
# 									  It is useful only with transactional tables such as InnoDB, because then it dumps the consistent state of the DB
# 									  at the time when START TRANSACTION was issued without blocking any app.
#
# 									  Only InnoDB tables are dumped in a consistent state. For example - MyISAM or MEMORY tables dumped while using this
# 									  may still change state.
#
# 									  While a --single-transaction dump is in process, to ensure a valid dump file (correct table contents and binary log coords)
# 									  no other connection should use the following statements:
#
# 									  ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, RENAME TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE
#
# 									  a consistent read is not isolated from those statements - so use of them on a table to be dumped
# 									  can cause the SELECT that is performed by mysqlpump to retrieve the table contents to obtain
# 									  incorrect contents or fail.
#
# 								     --add-locks is exclusive against --single-transaction
#
# --skip-definer 				- Omit DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses from the CREATE statements for views and stored programs. The dump file,
# 									  when reloaded - creates objects that use the default DEFINER and SQL SECURITY values.
#
# --skip-dump-rows, 			- Do not dump table rows
#  -d
#
# --socket= 						- For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use - or on Windows, name of the named pipe to use
# {<file name>|<pipe name>}, 
# -S {<file name>|<pipe name>}
#
# --ssl* 							- Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys/certs
#
# --ssl-fips-mode= 				- Whether to use fips mode on client. 
#  {OFF|ON|STRICT}
#
# --tls-version=<protocol list> - The protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections.
#
# --triggers 						- Include triggers for each dumped table in the output.
# 										  Enabled by default - use --skip-triggers to disable it
#
# --tz-utc 							- Enables TIMESTAMP columns to be dumped and reloaded between servers in different time zones.
# 										  mysqlpump Sets its connection time zone to UTC and adds SET TIME_ZONE='+00:00' to the dump file.
#
# 										  Without this option - TIMESTAMP columns are dumped and reloaded in the time zones local to the source
# 										  and destination server - which can cause the values to change if servers are in different time zones.
# 
# 										  --tz-utc also protects against changes due to daylight saving time.
#
# 										  Enabled by default, use --skip-tz-utc to disable it
#
# --user=<user name>, 		   - Name of MySQL user to connect with
#  -u <user_name>
#
# --users 							- Dump user accs as logical definitions in the form of CREATE USER and GRANT statements.
# 											
#                               User definitions are stored in the grant tables in the mysql system database. By default, mysqlpump
# 										  does not include the grant tables in mysql database dumps.
#
# 										  To dump the contents of the grant tables as logical definitions - use the --users option and suppress
# 										  all database dumping:
#
# 										  mysqlpump --exclude-databases=% --users
#
# --version, -V 					- Display version info and exit
#
# --watch-progress 				- Periodically display a progress indicator that provides info about the completed and total number of tables, rows, etc.
# 										  On by default - --skip-watch-progress to disable it
#
# The following section covers mysqlpump Object Selection
#
# mysqlpump has a set of inclusion and exclusion options that enable filtering of several object types and control which objects to dump:
#
# --include-databases and --exclude-databases apply to databases and all objects within them
# --include-tables and --exclude-tables apply to tables. These options also affect triggers associated with tables unless the trigger-specific
# 																			options are given.
# --include-triggers and --exclude-triggers - apply to triggers
#
# --include-routines and --exclude-routines - apply to stored procedures and functions. If a routine option matches a stored
# 															 function of the same name.
#
# --include-events and --exclude-events - apply to Event Scheduler events
#
# --include-users and --exclude-users - apply to user accounts
#
# Any inclusion or exclusion option may be given multiple times. Stacks. Order of options does not matter.
# The value of each inclusion and exclusion option is a list of namings
#
# --exclude-databases=test,world
# --include-tables=customer,invoice
#
# Wildcard chars are permitted (% as sequence, _ as regex against singular char)
#
# Example: --include-tables=t%, _____tmp matches all table names that begin with t - and all len(5) table names that end with tmp
#
# For users, a name specified without a host part is interpreted with an implied host of %.
# For example: u1 and u1@% are equivalent.
#
# Inclusion and exclusion options interact as follows:
#
# With no inclusion or exclusion options - mysqlpump dumps all databases (with a few notable exceptions)
#
# If inclusion options are given in the absence of exclusion options - only the objects named as included are dumped.
#
# If exclusion options are given in the absence of inclusion options - all objects are dumped except those named as excluded.
#
# If inclusion and exclusion options are given - all objects named as excluded and not named as inlcuded are not dumped. All others are.
#
# If multiple DBs are being dumped - it is possible to name tables, triggers and routines in a specific database by qualifying 
# the object names with the DB name.
#
# Example:
#
# mysqlpump --include-databases=db1,db2 --exclude-tables=db1.t1,db2.t2 #Dumps db1 and db2, but excludes specific tables
#
# The following options provide alternative ways to specify which DB to dump:
#
# The --all-databases option dumps all DBs (with certain exceptions). Equivalent to specifying no object options at all
#
# --include-databases=% is similar to --all-databases, but selects all databases for dumping, even those that are exceptions for --all-databases
#
# The --databases option causes mysqlpump to treat all name args as names of DBs to dump.
# Equivalent to an --include-databases option that names the same DBs.
#
# mysqlpump Parallel Processing
#
# mysqlpump can use parallelism to achieve concurrent processing. You can select concurrency between DBs (to dump multiple DBs at once)
# and within DBs (to dump multiple objects from a given DB simultaneously)
#
# By default - mysqlpump sets up one queue with two threads. You can create additional queues and control the number of threads assigned
# to each one - including the default queue:
#
# --default-parallelism=<N> specifies the default number of threads used for each queue. In the absence of this Option, N is 2.
#
# 									 The default queue always uses the default number of threads. Additional queues use the default number of threads
# 									 unless you specify otherwise.
#
# --parallel-schemas=[<N:>] sets up a processing queue for dumping the DBs named in <db_list> and optionally specifies how many
#  <db_list> 					 threads the queue uses.
#
# 									 <db_list> is a list of DB names. If the option argument begins with <N:>, the queue uses <N> threads.
# 									 Otherwise, the --default-parallelism option determines the number of queue threads.
#
# 									 Multiple instances of the --parallel-schemas option create multiple queues.
#
# 									 Names in the database list are permitted to contain the same % and _ wildcards as filtering.
#
# mysqlpump uses the default queue for processing any DBs not named explicitly with a --parallel-schemas option, and for dumping 
# user defs if cmd options select them.
#
# In general - with multiple queues, mysqlpump uses parallelism between the sets of DBs processed by the queues, to dump multiple
# DBs at once.
#
# For a queue that uses multiple threads, mysqlpump uses parallelism within DBs - to dump multiple objects from a given DB at once.
# Exceptions can occur; for example, mysqlpump may block queues while it obtains from the server lists of objects in DBs.
#
# With parallelism on - it is possible for output from different DBs to interleave. For example, INSERT statements from multiple
# tables dumped in parallel can be interleaved - they are not written in any specific order.
#
# Does not affect reloading because output statements qualify object names with DB names or are preceded by USE statements as required.
#
# The smallest scope of parallelism - is a single DB.
#
# Example:
#
# mysqlpump --parallel-schemas=db1,db2 --parallel-schemas=db3 #Partition db1 and db2 to a specific queue, another to Db3 - and a default for the rest. All queues use two threads.
#
# mysqlpump --parallel-schemas=db1,db2 --parallel-schemas=db3 --default-parallelism=4 #Same as above, except 4 threads for each queue
#
# We can also further partition thread usage if we wish:
#
# mysqlpump --parallel-schemas=5:db1,db2 --parallel-schemas=3:db3 #Run with 5 threads for queue related to db1 and db2, run with 3 for queue on db3, 2 for default to rest
#
# We can also disable multi-threading and allocate no queues
#
# --default-parallelism=0 and no --parallel-schemas options - runs a single-threaded process and creates no queues.
#
# The following pertains to mysqlpump in terms of restrictions
#
# mysqlpump does not dump the performance_schema, ndbinfo or sys schema by default. To dump any of said ones, name them
# explicitly on cmd line. Can also name them with --databases or --include-databases option
#
# mysqlpump does not dump the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema
#
# mysqlpump does not dump InnoDB CREATE_TABLESPACE statements
#
# mysqlpump dumps user accounts in logical form using CREATE USER and GRANT statements (for example - when using the --include-users or --users option)
# For this reason, dumps of the mysql system DB do not by default include the grant tables that contain user defs:
#
# user,db,tables_priv, columns_priv, procs_priv or proxies_priv. To dump any of the grant tables, name the mysql DBs by the table names:
#
# mysqlpump mysql user db ...
#
# The following section pertains to mysqlshow.
#
# The mysqlshow client can be used to quickly see which DB exists, their tables or a table's columns or indexes.
#
# mysqlshow provides a cmd-line interface to several SQL SHOW statements. The same info can be obtained by using those statements directly.
# For example - we can issue them from the mysql client program.
#
# mysqlshow [<options>] [<db_name> [<tbl_name> [<col_name>]]]
#
# If no DB is given - a list of DB names is shown.
# If no table is given - all matching tables in the DB are shown.
# If no column is given - all matching columns and column types in the table are shown.
#
# The output displays only the names of those databases, tables or columns for which you have some privs.
# 
# If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard chars (*, ?, %, or _) - only those names that are matched
# by the wildcard are shown. If a DB name contains any underscores - those should be escaped with // or /.
#
# * and ? are converted into SQL % and _ wildcard chars. This might cause some confusion when you try to display
# the columns for a table with a _ in the name, because in this case - mysqlshow shows you only the table names
# that match the pattern.

# The following covers mysqlslap , used for diagnostics to emulate client load for a MySQL Server and to report timing of each stage.
#
# The interaction is emulating as if multiple clients are accessing the server.
#
# mysqlslap [<options>]
#
# Some options such as --create or --query enables you to specify a string containing an SQL statement or a file containing statements.
# If it specifies a file - it must contain one statement per line. (Implicit delimiter is \n)
#
# Use the --delimiter to specify a different delimiter - which allows us to span multiple lines or place multiple statements on a single line.
# Comments cannot be included in terms of mysqlslap
#
# It runs in three stages:
#
# Create schema, table and optionally any stored programs or data to use for the test. This stage uses a single client connection
# 
# Run the load test. Can use many client connections
#
# Clean up (disconnect, drop table if specified) - uses a single client connection
#
# An example of 50 clients, 200 selects for each - created query integrated:
#
# mysqlslap --delimiter=";" 
#   --create="CREATE TABLE a (b int);INSERT INTO a VALUES (23)"
#   --query="SELECT * FROM a" --concurrency=50 --iterations=200
#
# Let mysqlslap build the query SQL statements with a table of two INT and Three VARCHAR columns.
# Use five clients querying 20 times each. 
#
# Do not create the table or insert the data (that is - use previous test's schema and data):
#
# mysqlslap --concurrency=5 --iterations=20 #5 clients, 20 times each
#   --number-int-cols=2 --number-char-cols=3 #2 int, 3 char
#   --auto-generate-sql #Auto build the query statements
#
# Tell the program to load the create, insert and query SQL statements from the specified files - where the
# create.sql has multiple table creation statements delimited by ';' and multiple insert statements delimited by
# ';'
#
# In this instance, the Query file has multiple queries delimited by ';'. Run all of em, then run all
# the queries in the query file with five clients (five times each):
#
# mysqlslap --concurrency=5
#   --iterations=5 --query=query.sql --create=create.sql
#   --delimiter=";"
#

# The following section covers Administrative and Utility programs
#
# The following pertains to ibd2sdi - InnoDB Tablespace SDI Extraction Utility
#
# ibd2sdi is a utility for extracting serialized dictionary information (SDI) from InnoDB tablespace files.
# SDI data is present all persistent InnoDB tablespace files.
#
# ----------------------------------------------
# SDI:
#
# Dictionary object metadata in a serialized form. SDI is stored in JSON format.
#
# >= 8.0.3, SDI is present in all InnoDB tablespace files except for temp tablespace and undo tablespace files.
# The presence of SDI in tablespace files provides metadata redundancy. For example - dictionary object metadata
# can be extracted from tablespace files using the ib2sdi utility if the data dictionary becomes unavailable.
#
# For a MyISAM table, SDI is stored in a .sdi metadata file in the schema dir. 
# An SDI metadata file is required to perform an IMPORT TABLE operation.
# 															
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# ibd2sdi can be run on:
# file-per-table tablespace files (*.ibd files), 
# general tablespace files (*.ibd files),
# system tablespace files (ibdata* files),
# data dict tablespace (mysql.ibd) 
#
# It is not supported for use with temp tablespaces or undo tablespaces.
#
# ib2sdi can be used at runtime or while the server is offline. 
# During DDL operations, ROLLBACK operations, and to undo log purge operations related to SDI.  
# There may be a short interval of time when ibd2sdi fails to read SDI data stored in the tablespace.
#
# ibd2sdi performs an uncommitted read of SDI from the specified tablespace. Redo logs and undo logs are not accessed.
# To invoke the ibd2sdi:
#
# ib2sdi [<options>] <file_name1> [<file_name2> <file_name3> ...]
#
# ibd2sdi supports multi-file tablespaces like the InnoDB system tablespace - but it cannot be run on more
# than one tablespace at a time.
#
# For multi-file tablespaces:
#
# ibd2sdi <ibdata1 ibdata2>
#
# The files of a multi-file tablespace must be specified in order of the ascending page number.
# If two successive files have the same space ID - the later file must start with the 
# last page number of the previous file + 1.
#
# ibd2sdi outputs SDI (containing id, type and data fields) in JSON format.
#
# ibd2sdi Options
#
# ibd2sdi supports the following options:
#
# --help, -h

#
# The following covers innochecksum - Offline InnoDB File Checksum Utility
#
# Innochecksum prints checksums for InnoDB files. 
#
# This tool reads an InnoDB tablespace file, calculates the checksum for each page, 
# compares the calculated checksum to the stored checksum and reports mismatches, 
# which indicate damaged pages.
#
# Originally developed to speed up verifying the integrity of tablespace files after power
# outages but can also be used after file copies.
#
# Because checksum mismatches cause InnoDB to deliberately shut down a running server,
# it may be preferable to use this tool rather than waiting for an in-production server to encounter the damaged pages.
#
# Innochecksum cannot be used on tablespace files that the server already has open.
# For such files, you should use CHECK TABLE to check tables within the tablespace.
#
# Attempting to run innochecksum on a tablespace that the server already has open will
# result in an "Unable to lock file" error.
#
# If checksum mismatches are found - you would normally restore the tablespace from backup
# or start the server and attempt to use mysqldump to make a backup of the tables within the tablespace.
#
# innochecksum [<options>] <file_name>
#
# innochecksum supports the following options. For options that refer to page numbers, the numbers are zero-based:
#
# --help, -? 
# innochecksum --help
#
# --info, -I
# Synonym for --help. Displays command line help.
# innochecksum --info
#
# --version, -V
# Displays version info
# innochecksum --version
#
# --verbose, -v
# Verbose mode; prints progress indicator to log file every five seconds. 
# 
# innochecksum --verbose - Verbose mode on
#
# innochecksum --verbose=FALSE - Verbose mode off
#
# --verbose and --log can be specified at the same time:
#
# innochecksum --verbose --log=/var/lib/mysql/test/logtest.txt
#
# To locate the progress indicator info in the log file - you can preform the following search:
#
# cat ./logtest.txt | grep -i "okay"
#
# Prints lines simply put of status, progress, etc.
#
# --count, -c - Prints a count of the number of pages in the file and exit.
# innochecksum --count ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# --start-page=<num>, -s <num> - Starts at this page number:
#
#  innochecksum --start-page=600 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
#  innochecksum -s 600 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# --end-page=<num>, - End at this page number
#  -e <num>
# 							 --end-page=700 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# 							 --p 700 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
# 
# --page=<num>, -p <num> - Check only this page number.
# 									innochecksum --page=701 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# --strict-check, -C - Specify a strict checksum algo. Options include innodb, crc32 and none.
#
# 							  innochecksum --strict-check=innodb ../data/test/tab1.ibd #use innodb checksum
#
# 							  innochecksum -C crc32 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# 							  The following conditions apply:
#
# 							  If you do not specify --strict-check - innochecksum validates against innodb, crc32 and none.
#
# 							  If none: only checksums generated by none are allowed
# 							  If innodb: only checksums generated by innodb are allowed
# 							  If crc32: only checksums generated by crc32 are allowed
#
# --no-check, -n - Ignore the checksum verification when rewriting a checksum. This option may only be used with the innochecksum
# 						 --write option. If the --write option is not specified - innochecksum will terminate.
#
# 						 Example of innodb checksum rewritten to replace invalid checksum:
#
# 						 innochecksum --no-check --write innodb ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# --allow-mismatches, - The max number of checksum mismatches allowed before innochecksum terminates.
#  -a 						Defaults to 0. If --allow-mismatches=<N>, where N>=0 - N mismatches are permitted and innochecksum terminates at N+1.
#
# 								When --allow-mismatches is set to 0, innochecksum terminates on the first checksum mismatch.
#
# 								In this example, an existing innodb checksum is written to set --allow-mismatches to 1.
#
# 								innochecksum --allow-mismatches=1 --write innodb ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# 								With --allow-mismatches set to 1, if there is a mismatch at page 600 and another at page 700 out of 1k pages
#
# 								If a mismatch at 600 and 700, it's updated for 0-599 - and 601-699 - terminates at second.
# 								Leaves 600 and 700-999 unchanged
#
# --write=<name>, 	 - Rewrite a checksum. When rewriting an invalid checksum, the --no-check option must be used together with
# 								the --write option.
#
# 								The --no-check option tells innochecksum to ignore verification of the invalid checksum.
# 								You do not have to specify the --no-check option if the current checksum is valid.
#
# 								An Algo must be specified when using the --write option. Possible values are:
#
# 								innodb - Checksum calculated in software, using the original algo from InnoDB
# 								crc32 - Checksum calculated using the crc32, possibly done with a hardware assist
# 								none - A constant number
#
# 								The --write option rewrites entire pages to disk. If the new checksum is identical to the existing
# 								checksum, the new checksum is not written to disk in order to minimize I/O.
#
# 								innochecksum obtains an exclusive lock when the --write option is used.
#
# 								In this example, a crc32 checksum is written for tab1.ibd:
#
# 								innochecksum -w crc32 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# 								Here, we replace the invalid crc32 checksum:
#
# 								innochecksum --no-check --write crc32 ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# --page-type-summary, - Display a count of each page type in a tablespace. Example:
#  -S 						 innochecksum --page-type-summary ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# 								 Sample output for --page-type-summary:
#
# 								 File::./data/test/tab1.ibd
# 								 ====================PAGE TYPE SUMMARY===================
# 								 #PAGE_COUNT PAGE_TYPE
# 								 ========================================================
# 								 		2 		 Index page
# 										0      Undo log page
# 										1 		 Incode page
# 										0 		 Insert buffer free list page
# 										2 		 Freshly allocated page
# 										1 		 Insert buffer bitmap
# 									   0 		 System page
# 										0 		 Transaction system page
# 										1 		 File Space Header
# 										0 		 Extent descriptor page
# 										0 		 BLOB page
# 										0 		 Compressed BLOB page
# 									   0 		 Other type of page
# 								 =========================================================
# 								 Additional information:
# 								 Undo page type: 0 insert, 0 update, 0 other
# 								 Undo page state: 0 active, 0 cached, 0 to_free, 0 to_purge, 0 prepared, 0 other
#
# --page-type-dump,   - Dump the page type info for each page in a tablespace to stderr or stdout. Example:
#  -D 						innochecksum --page-type-dump=/tmp/a.txt ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# --log, -l 			 - Log output for the innochecksum tool. A log file name must be provided.
# 								Log output contains checksum values for each tablespace page.
#
# 								For uncompressed tables, LSN values are also provided. The --log replaces the --debug option,
# 								which was available in earlier releases. Example usage:
#
# 								innochecksum --log=/tmp/log.txt ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# 								innochecksum -l /tmp/log.txt ../data/test/tab1.ibd
#
# - Option
# Specify this to read from STD input.
# 								Specify the - option to read from STD input. 
# 								
# 								If the - option is missing when "read from standard in" is expected
# 								innochecksum will output innochecksum usage information indicating that the
# 								"-" option was omitted. Examples of usage:
#
# 								cat t1.ibd | innochecksum -
#
# 								In this example, innochecksum writes the crc32 checksum algorithm to a.ibd without
# 								changing the original t1.ibd file.
#
# 								cat t1.ibd | innochecksum --write=crc32 - > a.ibd
#
# The following section covers the case of running innochecksum on Multiple User-defined Tablespace files
#
# User defined tablespace files are denoted (.ibd)
#
# The following examples demonstrate how to run innochecksum on multiple user-defined tablespace files
#
# innochecksum ./data/test/*.ibd #Run innochecksum for all tablespace (.ibd) files in a DB called "test"
#
# innochecksum ./data/test/t*.ibd #Run innochecksum for all tablespace files (.ibd files) that start with t
#
# innochecksum ./data/*/*.ibd #Run innochecksum for all tablespace files (.ibd files) in the data dir
#
# Running innochecksum on multiple user-defined tablespace files is not supported on Windows OS, as Windows shells
# such as cmd.exe do not support glob pattern expansion.
#
# On Windows systems, innochecksum must be run separately for each user-defined tablespace file.
# 
# cmd> innochecksum.exe t1.ibd
# cmd> innochecksum.exe t2.ibd
# cmd> innochecksum.exe t3.ibd
#
# The following section covers innochecksum on Multiple System Tablespace Files
#
# By default - there is only one InnoDB system tablespace file (ibdata1) but multiple files for the system
# tablespace can be defined using the innodb data file path option.
#
# In the following example, three files for the system tablespace are defined using the innodb data file path option:
# ibdata1, ibdata2 and ibdata3
#
# ./bin/mysqld --no-defaults --innodb-data-file-path="ibdata1:10M;ibdata2:10M;ibdata3:10M:autoextend"
#
# The three above files form a logical system tablespace.
#
# To run innochecksum on multiple files that form one logical system tablespace - innochecksum requires the
# - option to read the tablespace file from Standard input - which equates to concatenating multiples files to creating one.
#
# To run the above, we would use:
#
# cat ibdata* | innochecksum -
#
# Windows CMD shell does not support globbing patterns - thus each file must be run seperately.
#
# The following covers myisam_ftdump - Used to display Full-Text Index information:
#
# myisam_ftdump displays info about FULLTEXT indexes in MyISAM tables.
# It reads MyISAM index files directly - so it must be run on the server host where the table is located.
#
# Before using myisam_ftdump, be sure to issue a FLUSH TABLES statement first if the server is running.
#
# myisam_ftdump scans and dumps the entire index - which is not fast. Does not need to be run often, however.
#
# To invoke the myisam_ftdump:
#
# myisam_ftdump [<options>] <tbl_name> <index_num>
#
# We can also specify the table name by naming its index file (a file with .MYI suffix).
#
# If we do not invoke the myisam_ftdump in the dir where the table files are located - the table
# or index file name must be preceded by the path name to the table's DB dir.
#
# Index numbers begin with 0.
#
# Assume the base of:
#
# CREATE TABLE mytexttable
# (
# 	 id 	INT NOT NULL, #Index 0
#   txt  TEXT NOT NULL, #Index 1
#   PRIMARY KEY (id),
#   FULLTEXT (txt)
# ) ENGINE=MyISAM;
#
# If the cwd is test DB dir, invoke myisam_ftdump:
#
# myisam_ftdump mytexttable 1
#
# If our path name to the test DB dir is /usr/local/mysql/data/test - you can also specify the table
# name arg using that path name.
#
# myisam_ftdump /usr/local/mysql/data/test/mytexttable 1
#
# We can also use myisam_ftdump to generate a list of index entries in order of frequency of occurence
# on Unix systems:
#
# myisam_ftdump -c mytexttable 1 | sort -r #-c is count, pipe the output and sort it - -r here is Recursive calling
#
# On Windows, can use:
#
# myisam_ftdump -c mytexttable 1 | sort /R - same as above, except /R is Recursive interaction on Windows
#
# The following options are supported by myisam_ftdump:
#
# --help, -h -? - Display a help message and exit
#
# --count, -c - Calculate per-word stats (counts and global weights)
#
# --dump, -d - Dump the index, include data offset and word weights
#
# --length, -l - Report length distribution
#
# --stats, -s - Report global index stats. Default operation if not other operation is specified
#
# --verbose, -v - Verbose. 
#
# The following section covers - myisamchk - a MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility
#
# The myisamchk utility gets information about the DB, checks, repairs or optimizes them.
#
# myisamchk works with MyISAM tables (tables with .MYD and .MYI files for storing data and indexes)
#  
# We can also use the CHECK TABLE and REPAIR TABLE to check and repair MyISAM tables.
#
# NOTE: Not supported for partitioned tables, have backups in case of Errors.
#
# General syntax of myisamchk:
#
# myisamchk [<options>] <tbl_name> ...
#
# myisamchk defaults to checking tables - to get more info or correct tables - specify options.
#
# Path of file is relative if relative, Absolute if Absolute
#
# myisamchk *.MYI #Checks all files in CWD
#
# Absolute path check:
#
# myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI
#
# * wildcarding is also allowed for Folders.
#
# An example of running a fast check on all MyISAM tables:
#
# myisamchk --silent --fast /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
#
# An example of repairing any corrupt tables and checking:
#
# myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state \
# 	  --key_buffer_size=64M --myisam_sort_buffer_size=64M \
# 	  --read_buffer_size=1M --write_buffer_size=1M \
# 	  /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
#
# Assumes >= 64M memory allocation
#
# When checking tables - no other operations are to be run on them. I.e - they must be locked - or server completely dead.
#
# Otherwise, we might get:
#
# warning: Clients are using or have not closed table properly
#
# This can occur if the table has not been closed or it has been updated - Iterating over it and modifying it in this state,
# can cause corruption and loss of data in terms of MyISAM tables.
#
# If mysqld is running - you must force it to flush table modifications, to clear buffered memory with FLUSH TABLES.
# 
# We could also just use CHECK TABLE to check tables.
#
# myisamchk supports the following options - can be specified on CMD or in the [myisamchk] group of an option file.

# The following pertains to myisamchk General Options
#
# --help, -? - Display help and exit. Options are grouped by type of operation
# --HELP, -H - Displays help and exit. Presented in a single list.
# --debug=<debug options>, - Write a debugging log. Typical string is d:t:o, <file_name>. Defaults to d:t:o, /tmp/myisamchk.trace
#  -# <debug_options>
# --defaults-extra-file=<file name> - Read this option file after global option file but (On Unix) before the User option file.
# 												  Relative if relative, absolute if absolute - if cannot access file, error is thrown
# --defaults-file=<file name> - Use only the given option file. Relaive if relative, absolute if absolute - error thrown if inaccessible.
# --defaults-group-suffix - Read not only the usual option groups, but also suffix regex. Normally only reads [myisamchk]
#
# --no-defaults - Do not read any option files. .mylogin.cnf is read if exists 
# --print-defaults - Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files
# --silent, -s - Silent mode. Write output only when errors occur - stacks twice (-ss)
# --verbose, -v - Verbose mode. Prints more info about what the program does. Can be used with -d and -e. Stacks.
# --wait, -w - Instead of terminating with an error if the table is locked - wait until the table is unlocked before continuing.
# 					If you are running mysqld with external locking disabled - the table can be locked only by another myisamchk cmd
#
# We can also define the following variables with the general syntax of --var_name=value:
#
# 		Var 					 Default
# decode_bits 				 9
# ft_max_word_len 		 version-dependent
# ft_min_word_len 		 4
# ft_stopword_file 		 built-in-list
# key_buffer_size 		 523264
# myisam_block_size 		 1024
# myisam_sort_key_blocks 16
# read_buffer_size 		 262136
# sort_buffer_size 		 2097144
# sort_key_blocks 		 16
# stats_method 			 nulls_unequal
# write_buffer_size 		 262136
#
# The possible myisamchk vars and their default values can be examined with myisamchk --help:
#
# myisam_sort_buffer_size is used when the keys are repaired by sorting keys, which is the normal case when you use
# --recover. 
#
# sort_buffer_size is a deprecated synonym for myisam_sort_buffer_size
#
# key_buffer_size is used when you are checking the table with --extend-check or when the keys are repaired by inserting
# keys row by row into the table 
#
# Repairing through the key buffer is used in the following cases:
#
# You use --safe-recover
#
# The temp files needed to sort the keys would be more than twice as big as when creating the key file directly.
# This is usually the case when you have large key values for CHAR, VARCHAR or TEXT columns - because the sort operation
# needs to store the complete key values as it proceeds.
#
# If we have  a lot of tmp space and we can force myisamchk to repair by sorting - we can use the --sort-recover option.
#
# Repairing through the key buffer takes much less disk space than using sorting, but is also much slower.
#
# If we wish to have fast repairs - we can set the key_buffer_size and myisam_sort_buffer_size var to about 25%
# of our available memory.
#
# Only one of em is used at a time.
#
# myisam_block_size is the size used for index blocks.
#
# stats_method influences how NULL values are treated for index stats collection when the --analyze option is given.
# It acts like the myisam_stats_method system var.
#
# ft_min_word_len and ft_max_word_len indicate the min and max word length for FULLTEXT indexes on MyISAM tables.
# ft_stopword_file names the stopword file. 
#
# If we use myisamchk to perform an operation that modifies table indexes (such as repair or analyze), the FULLTEXT
# indexes are rebuilt using the default full-text param values for min and max word length and the stopword file unless specified otherwise.
# This can cause Queries to fail.
# 
# This can occur due to that said params are known only by the server.
# They are not stored in MyISAM index files. 
#
# To avoid the problem if you have modified the min or max word length or the stopward file in the server, specify
# the same ft_min_word_len, ft_max_word_len and ft_stopword_file values to myisamchk that we use for mysqld.
#
# For example - if we have set the min word length to 3 - we can repair a table with myisamchk as follows:
#
# myisamchk --recover --ft_min_word_len=3 <tbl_name.MYI>
#
# To ensure that myisamchk and the server uses the same values for full-text params - we can place each one in both the
# [mysqld] and [myisamchk] sections of a option file:
#
# [mysqld]
# ft_min_word_len=3
#
# [myisamchk]
# ft_min_word_len=3
#
# An alternative to using myisamchk is to use the REPAIR TABLE, ANALYZE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE or ALTER TABLE.
#
# The above statements are executed by the server.
#
# The following section covers myisamchk Check options
#
# myisamchk supports the following options for table checking ops:
#
# --check, -c - Check the table for errors. Default operation if you specify no option that selects an operation type explicitly
# --check-only-changed, -C - Check only tables that have changed since the last check
# --extend-check, -e - Check the table extensively. Very slow. Extreme case usage. Can raise key_buffer_Size to help speed.
# --fast, -F - Check only tables that have not been closed properly
# --force, -f - Do a repair operation automatically if myisamchk finds any errors in the table. Same as --recover or -r
# --information, -i - Print info stats about the table that is being checked
# --medium-check, -m - Faster than --extend-check.
# --read-only, -T - Do not mark the table as checked - useful if you use myisamchk to check a table that is in use by some other app that does not use locking 
# 						  - such as mysqld when run with external locking disabled
# --update-state, -U - Store info in the .MYI file to indicate when the table was checked and whether the table crashed. Should be used to get full benefit
# 							  of the --check-only-changed option - but you should not use this option if the mysqld server is using the table and you run it with external locking off.
#
#
# The following section covers myisamchk Repair Options
#
# myisamchk supports the following options for table repair operations (operations performed when an option such as --recover or --safe-recover is given):
#
# --back, -B - Make a backup of the .MYD file as <file_name-time.BAK>
# --character-sets-dir=<dir name> - The dir where char sets are installed
# --correct-checksum - Correct the checksum info for the table
# --data-file-length=<len>, -D <len> - The max length of the data file (when re-creating data file when it is "full")
# --extend-check, -e - Do a repair that tries to recover every possible row from the data file.
# 							  Normally - this also finds a lot of garbage rows.  Extreme case usage.
# --force, -f - Overwrite old intermediate files (files with names like <tbl_name.TMD>) instead of aborting
#
# --keys-used=<val>, - For myisamchk - the option value is a bit value that indicates which indexes to update.
#  -k <val> 			  Each binary bit of the option value corresponds to a table index - where the first index is bit 0.
# 							  
# 							  An option value of 0 disables updates to all indexes, which can be used to get faster inserts.
#							  Deactivated indexes can be reactivated by using myisamchk -r.
#
# --no-symlinks, -l  - Do not follow symbolic links. Normally myisamchk repairs the table that a symlink points to. 
# 							  Deprecated past 4.0 because symlinks are not removed during repair operations.
#
# --max-record-length= - Skip rows larger than the given length if myisamchk cannot allocate memory to hold them.
#  <len>  							  
#
# --parallel-recover,  - Use the same technique as -r and -n, but create all the keys in parallel - using different threads. (beta)
#  -p 
#
# --quick, -r 			  - Achieve a faster repair by modifying only the index file - not the data file.
# 								 You can specify this option twice to force myisamchk to modify the original data file in case of duplicate keys.
#
# --recover, -r 		  - Do a repair that can fix almost any problem except unique keys that are not unique.
# 								 Use this to recover tables.
#
# 								 Data remains intact if this fails. If it fails, use --safe-recover instead.
#
# --safe-recover,  	  - Do a repair using an old recovery method that reads through all rows in order and updates all index trees
#  -o 						 based on the rows found.
#
# 								 Slower than --recover, uses less memory though.
#
# --set-collation=     - Specify the collation to use for sorting table indexes. The char set is implied by the first part of the collation name.
#  <name> 
#
# --sort-recover, 	  - Force myisamchk to use sorting to resolve the keys even if temp files would be v large
#  -n
#
# --tmpdir=<dir name>, - The path of the dir to be used for storing temp files. If not set - myisamchk uses the value of the TMPDIR env var.
#  -t <dir name> 			 --tmpdir can be set to a list of dir paths that are used successivly on rotation for creating temp files.
#								 Separation char is : on Unix, ; on Windows.
#
# --unpack, -u - Unpack a table that was packed with myisampack.
#
# The following covers myisamchk options for actions other than table checks and repairs:
#
# --analyze, -a - Analyze the distribution of key values. This improves join performance by enabling the join optimizer to better choose the order
# 						in which to join the tables and which indexes it should use.
#
# 						To obtain information about the key distribution - use a myisamchk --description --verbose <tbl name> command or
# 						the SHOW INDEX FROM <tbl_name> statement.
#
# --block-search=<offset> - Find the record that a block at the given offset belongs to.
#  -b <offset>
#
# --description, -d - Print some descriptive info about the table. Specifying the --verbose option once or twice produces more info.
#
# --set-auto-increment [=<value>], - Force AUTO_INCREMENT numbering for new records to start at the given value (or higher - if there exists
#  -A [<value>] 							 records with AUTO_INCREMENT values this large).
#
# 												 If <value> is not specified, <AUTO_INCREMENT> numbers for new records begin with the largest value in the table + 1.
#
# --sort-index, -S 	- 	Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order. Optimizes seeks and makes table scans that use indexes faster.
#
# --sort-records=<N>, - Sort records according to a particular index. This makes your data much more localized and may speed up range-based
#  -R <N> 					SELECT and ORDER BY operations that use this index.
#
# 								May be very slow at first use.
#
# 								To determine table index number - use SHOW INDEX, which displays a table's indexes in the same order
# 								that myisamchk sees them. Indexes are numbered beginning with 1.
#
# 								If keys are not packed (PACK_KEYS=0) - they have the same length - so when myisamchk sorts and moves records,
# 								it just overwrites record offsets in the index.
#
# 								If keys are packed (PACK_KEYS=1), myisamchk must unpack key blocks first - then re-create indexes and pack
# 								the key blocks again. (re-creating indexes is faster than updating offsets for each index - in this case)
#
# The following covers how to obtain table info with myisamchk:
#
# To obtain a desc of a MyISAM table or stats about it - use the commands shown here. The output from these commands is explained later in this section.
#
# myisamchk -d <tbl name> - Runs myisamchk in "describe mode" to produce a description of your table. 
# 									 If you start the MySQL server with external locking disabled - myisamchk may report an
# 									 error for a table that is updated while it runs.
#
# 									 However - because myisamchk does not change the table in describe mode - there is no risk of destroying data.
#
# myisamchk -dv <tbl name> - Adding -v runs myisamchk in verbose mode so that it produces more info about the table. Stacks.
# myisamchk -eis <tbl name> - Shows only the most important information from a table. This operation is slow because it must read the entire table.
# myisamchk -eiv <tbl name> - This is like -eis, but tells you what is being done.
#
# The <tbl_name> arg can be either the name of a MyISAM table or the name of its index file. Multiple args can be given.
# 
# Assume following table Structure:
#
# CREATE TABLE person
# (
#   id 			INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
# 	 last_name 	VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
#   first_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
#   birth 		DATE,
#   death 		DATE,
#   PRIMARY KEY  (id),
#   INDEX (last_name, first_name),
#   INDEX (birth)
# ) MAX_ROWS = 10000000 ENGINE=MYISAM;
#
# Suppose also that the table has these data and index file sizes:
# -rw-rw---- 	1 mysql 	mysql 	9347072 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYD
# -rw-rw---- 	1 mysql 	mysql 	6066176 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYI
#
# An example of myisamchk -dvv would then output:

#
# Explanations for the types of information myisamchk produces are given here. "Keyfile" refers to the index file.
# "Record" and "row" are synonymous - as are "field" and "column"
#
# The initial part of the table desc contains these values:
#
# MyISAM file - Name of the MyISAM (index) file
# Record format - The format used to store table rows. The preceding examples use Fixed length.
# 						Other possible values are Compressed and Packed. (Packed corresponds to what SHOW TABLE STATUS reports as Dynamic)
# Character set - The table default char set
# File-version  - Version of MyISAM format. Always 1.
# Creation time - When the data file was created
# Recover time  - When the index/data file was last reconstructed
# Status 		 - Table status flags. Possible values are crashed, open, changed, analyzed, optimized keys and sorted index pages.
# Auto increment key, Last value - The key number associated the table's AUTO_INCREMENT column, and most recently generated value. Does not appear if none found.
# Data records  - Number of rows in the table
# Deleted blocks - How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. can optimize tables to minimize this space.
# Datafile parts - For dynamic-row format, this indicates how many data blocks there are. For an optimized table without fragmented rows, this is the same as Data records.
# 
# Deleted data - How many bytes of unreclaimed deleted data there are. You can optimize your table to minimize this space.
# Datafile pointer - The size of the data file pointer, in bytes. Usually is 2,3,4 or 5. Most manage with 2 - cannot be controlled with MySQL.
# 							For fixed tables - this is row address. For dynamic tables, this is byte address.
# Keyfile pointer - Size of the index file pointer, in bytes. Usually 1,2 or 3. Most manage with 2 - auto calculated by MySQL. is always a block address.
# Max datafile length - How long the table data file can become, in bytes.
# Max keyfile length - How long the table index can become, in bytes.
# Recordlength - How much space each row takes, in bytes.
#
# The table desc part of the output includes a list of all keys in the table. For each key, myisamchk displays some low-level info:
#
# Key - This key's number. This value is shown only for the first column of the key. If this value is missing, the line corresponds to the
# second or later column of a multiple-column key.
#
# For the table shown in the example, there are two table description lines for the second index.
# This indicates that it is a multiple-part index with two parts.
#
# Start - Where in the row this portion of the index starts.
# Len - How long this portion of the index is. For packed numbers, this should always be the full length of the column.
# 		  For strings - it may be shorter than the full length of the indexed column - because you can index a prefix of a string column.
#
# 		  The total length of a multiple-part key is the sum of the Len values for all key parts.
# Index - Whether a key value can exist multiple times in the index. Possible values are unique or multip. (multiple)
# Type - What data type this portion of the index has. This is a MyISAM data type with the possible values packed, stripped or empty.
# Root - Address of the root index block.
# Blocksize - The size of each index block. By default is 1024, but the value may be changed at compile time when MySQL is built from source.
# Rec/key - This is a statistical value used by the optimizer. It tells how many rows there are per value for this index.
# 				A unique index always has a value of 1. This may be updated after a table is loaded (or greatly changed) with myisamchk -a.
#
# 				If this is not updated at all,a default value os 30 is given.
#
# The last part of the output provides info about each column:
#
# Field - The column number.
# Start - The byte position of the column named within table rows.
# Length - The length of the column in bytes.
# Nullpos, Nullbit - For columns that can be NULL, MyISAM stores NULL values as a flag in a byte.
# 							Depending on how many nullable columns there are, there can be one or more bytes used for this purpose.
# 							The Nullpos and Nullbit values - if nonempty, indicate which byte and bit contains that flag indicating whether the column is NULL.
#
# 							The position and number of bytes used to store NULL flags is shown in the line for field 1. This is why there are
# 							six Field lines for the person table even though it has only five columns.
#
# Type - The data type. The value may contain any of the following descriptors:
# 			constant - all rows have the same value.
# 			no endspace - Do not store endspace.
# 			no endspace, not_always - Do not store endspace and do not do endspace compression for all values
# 			no endspace, no empty - Do not store endspace. Do not store empty values
# 			table-lookup - The column was converted to an ENUM.
# 			zerofill(N) - The most significant N bytes in the value are always 0 and are not stored.
#
# 			no zeros - Do not store zeros.
# 			always zero - Zero values are stored using one bit.
#
# Huff tree - The number of the Huffman tree associated with the column.
# Bits - The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.
#
# The Huff tree and Bits fields are displayed if the table has been compressed with myisampack.

#
# myisamchk -eiv output includes the following info:
#
# data records - Number of rows in the table
# Deleted blocks - How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. You can optimize your table to minimize this space.
# Key - The key number
# Keyblocks used - What percentage of the keyblocks are used. When a table has just been reorganized with myisamchk, the values
# 						 are very high (very near theoretical maximum)
# Packed - MySQL tries to pack key values that have a common suffix. This can only be used for indexes on CHAR and VARCHAR columns.
# 			  For long indexed strings that have similar leftmost parts - this can significantly reduce the space used.
#
# 			  In the preceeding example - the second key is 40 bytes long and a 97% reduction in space is achieved.
#
# Max levels - How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long key values get high values
# Records - How many rows are in the table.
# M.recordlength - The average row length. This is the exact row length for tables with fixed-length rows, because all rows have the same length.
# Packed - MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The Packed value indicates the percentage of savings achieved by doing this.
# Recordspace used - What percentage of the data file is used.
# Empty space - What percentage of the data file is unused.
# Blocks/Record - Average number of blocks per row (that is - how many links a fragmented row is compsoed of). This is always 1.0 for fixed-format tables.
#						This value should stay as close to 1.0 as possible. If it gets too large - you can reorganize the table.
# Recordblocks - How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed-format tables, this is the same as the number of rows.
# Deleteblocks - How many blocks (links) are deleted
#
# Recorddata - How many bytes in the data file are used
# Deleted data - How many bytes in the data file are deleted (unused)
# Lost space - If a row is updated to a shorter length - some space is lost. This is the sum of all such losses - in bytes.
# Linkdata - When the dynamic table format is used, row fragments are linked with pointers (4 to 7 bytes each).
# 				 Linkdata is the sum of the amount of storage used by all such pointers.
#
# The following section covers myisamchk Memory Usage:
#
# Memory allocation is important when you run myisamchk. myisamchk uses no more memory than its memory-related vars are set to.
# If you are going to use myisamchk on very large tables - you should first decide how much memory you want it to use.
#
# The default is to use about 3MB to perform repairs. By using larger values, you can get myisamchk to operate faster.
# For example, if you have more than 512MB RAM available - you could use options such as these (in addition to any other options you might specify):
#
# myisamchk --myisam_sort_buffer_size=256M \
# 						--key_buffer_size=512M   \
# 						--read_buffer_size=64M 	 \
# 						--write_buffer_size=64M ...
#
# Using --myisam_sort_buffer_size=16M is probably enough for most cases.
#
# Be aware that myisamchk uses temp files in TMPDIR. If TMPDIR points to a memory file system - out of memory
# errors can easily occur. If this happens - run myisamchk with the --tmpdir=<dir name> option to specify
# a dir located on a file system that has more space.
#
# When performing repair operations, myisamchk also needs a lot of disk space:
#
# Twice the size of the data file (the original file and copy). This space is not needed if you do a repair
# with --quick; in this case, only the index file is re-created. (This space must be available on the same file system as the original data file)
# as the copy is created in the same dir as the original.
# 
# Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The old index file is truncated at the start of the repair operation, so you usually
# ignore this space. This space must be available on the same file system as the original data file.
#
# When using --recover or --sort-recover (but not when using --safe-recover) - you need space on disk for sorting.
# This space is allocated in the temp dir (specified by TMPDIR or --tmpdir=<dir name>). 
#
# The following formula yields the amount of space required:
#
# (largest_key + row_pointer_length) * number_of_rows * 2
#
# You can check the length of the keys and the row_pointer_length with myisamchk -dv <table name>
# The <row_pointer_length> and <number_of_rows> values are the <Datafile pointer> and <Data records> values
# in the table desc.
#
# To determine the <largest_key> value - check the Key lines in the table desc.
# The Len column indicates the number of bytes for each key part.
# For a multiple-column index, the key size is the sum of the Len values for all key parts.
#
# If disk space is an issue in relation to repairs, use --safe-recover instead of --recover
#
# The following part pertains to myisamlog - Interactions of displaying MyISAM Log File Contents
#
# myisamlog processes the contents of a MyISAM log file. To create such a file, start the server with
# a --log-isam=<log file> option.
#
# Invoke myisamlog as follows:
#
# myisamlog [<options>] [<file_name> [<tbl_name>] ...]
#
# The default operation is to update (-u).
# If a recovery is done (-r) - all writes and possibly updates and deletes are done and errors are only counted.
# The default log file name is myisam.log if no <log_file> arg is given.
#
# If tables are named on the cmd line - only those tables are updated.
#
# myisamlog supports the following options:
#
# -?, -I - display a help message and exit
# -c <N> - Execute only N amount of commands
# -f <N> - Specify the max number of open files
# -F <filepath/> - Specify the file path with a trailing slash
# -i - Display extra info before exiting
# -o <offset> - Specify the starting offset
#
# -p <N> - Removes <N> components from path
# -r - Performs a recovery operation
# -R <record_pos_file record_pos> - Specify record pos file and record pos
# -u - Perform an update operation
# -v - Verbose mode. Print more output. Stacks.
# -w <write_file> - Specify the write file
# -V - version info
#
# myisampack - Generate compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables
#
# The myisampack utility compresses MyISAM tables. myisampack works by compressing each column in the table separately.
# Usually, myisampack packs the data file 40% to 70%
#
# When the table is used later - the server reads into memory the info needed to decompress columns.
# This results in much better performance when accessing individual rows, because you only have to uncompress exactly one row.
#
# MySQL uses mmap() when possible to perform memory mapping on compressed tables.
# If mmap() does not work - MySQL falls back to normal read/write file operations.
#
# NOTE: 
#
# If the mysqld server was invoked with external locking disabled - it is not a good idea to invoke myisampack if the 
# table might be updated by the server during the packing process. It is better to compress tables with the server turned off.
#
# After packing a table - it becomes read only. 
#
# myisampack does not support partitioned tables.
#
# To invoke:
#
# myisampack [<options>] <file_name> ...
#
# Each file name argument should be the name of an index (.MYI) file. 
# If you are not in the DB dir, you should specify the path name to the file. 
# It is permissible to omit the .MYI extension
#
# After we compress a table with myisampack - we can use myisamchk -rq to rebuild its indexes.
# 
# 
# It also reads option files and supports the options for processing them.
#
# myisampack supports the following options: 
#
# --help, -?
# --backup, -b - Make a backup of each table's data file using the name <tbl_name>.OLD
# --character-sets-dir=<dir name> - The dir where char sets are installed.
# --debug[=<debug_options>], - Write a debugging log. A typical <debug_options> string is d:t:o, <file_name>. Defaults to d:t:o
#  -# [<debug_options>]
# --force, -f - Produce a packed table even if it becomes larger than the original or if the intermediate file from an earlier invocation
# 					 of myisampack exists.
#
# 					 myisampack creates an intermediate file named <tbl_name>.TMD in the database dir while it compresses the table.
# 					 If you kill myisampack, the .TMD file might not be deleted.
# 					 Normally, myisampack exits with an error if it finds that <tbl_name>.TMD exists.
#
# 					 With --force, myisampack packs the table anyway.
#
# --join=<big tbl name>, - Join all tables named on the cmd line into a single packed table <big_tbl_name>.
#  -j <big_tbl_name> 		All tables that are to be combined must have identical structure (same column names and types, same indexes, etc.)
# 	
# 									<big_tbl_name> must not exist prior to the join operation. All source tables named on the cmd line
# 									to be merged into <big_tbl_name> must exist. The source tables are read for the join operation but not modified.
# --silent, -s 			 - Silent mode. Writes only error outputs.
# --test, -t 				 - Do not actually pack the table, just test packing it.
# --tmpdir=<dir name>,   - Use the named dir as the location where myisampack creates temp files.
#  -T <dir_name>
# --verbose, -v 			 - Verbose. Write info about the progress of the packing ops and its result.
# --version, -V 			 - Display version info and exit
# --wait, -w 				 - Wait and retry if the table is in use. If the mysqld server was invoked with external locking disabled, it is not a good idea
# 									to invoke myisampack if the table might be updated by the server during the packing process.

# myisampack displays the following kinds of info:
#
# normal - Number of cols for which no extra packing is used
# empty-spaces - Number of cols containing values that are only spaces. Occupies one bit.
# empty-zero - Number of cols containing values that are only binary zeros. Occupies one bit
# empty-fill - Number of integer cols that do not occupy the full byte range of their type. These are 
# 					changed to a smaller type. For example - a BIGINT column (eight bytes) can be stored
# 					as a TINYINT col (one byte) if all the values are in the range of a TINYINT (-128 to 127)
# pre-space  - Number of decimal cols that are stored with leading spaces. In this case - each value contains a count for the number of leading spaces.
# end-space  - Number of columns that have a lot of trailing space. In this case - each value contains a count for the number of trailing spaces
# table-lookup - The column had only a small number of different values, which are converted to ENUM before Huffman compression.
# zero 		 - Number of cols in which all values are zero
# Original trees - Initial number of Huffman trees.
# 
# After join - Number of distinct Huffman trees left after joining trees to save some header space.
#
# After a table has been compressed, the Field lines displayed by myisamchk -dvv include additional informaton about each col:
#
# Type - The data type. Can be one of the following:
#
# constant - Same values across all rows
# no endspace - Do not store endspace
# no endspace, not_always - Do not store endspace and do not do endspace compression for all values
# no endspace, no empty - Do not store endspace. Do not store empty values
# table-lookup - The column was converted to an ENUM.
# zerofill(<N>) - The most significant <N BYTES> in the value are always 0 and are not stored.
# no zeros - Do not store zeros
# always zero - Zero values are stored using one bit.
#
# Huff tree - Number of the Huffman tree associated with the column.
# Bits - Number of bits used in the huffman tree
#
# After you run myisampack, use myisamchk to re-create any indexes. 
# At this time, you can also sort the index blocks and create stats needed for the MySQL optimizer to work better:
#
# myisamchk -rq --sort-index --analyze <tbl_name.MYI>
#
# After you have installed the packed table into the MySQL DB dir, you should execute mysqladmin flush-tables to force
# mysqld to start using the new table.
#
# To unpack a packed table, use the --unpack option to myisamchk.
#
# The following covers mysql_config_editor - a MySQL Configuration Utility
#
# The mysql_config_editor utility enables you to store authentication creds in a obfuscated login path file named .mylogin.cnf
# 
# The file location is the %APPDATA%\MySQL directory on Windows and the current user's home dir on non-Windows systems.
# The file can be read later by MySQL client programs to obtain authentication credentials for connecting to MySQL server. 
#
# The unobfuscated format of the .mylogin.cnf login path consists of option groups, similar to other option files.
# Each option group in .mylogin.cnf is called a "login path" which is a group that permits only certain options:
#
# host, user, password, port and socket
#
# Think of a login path option group as a set of options that specify which MySQL server to connect to and which
# account to authenticate as.
#
# An unobfuscated example:
#
# [client]
# user = mydefaultname
# password = mydefaultpass
# host = 127.0.0.1
# [mypath]
# user = myothername
# password = myotherpass
# host = localhost
#
# Order of prio is: Cmd > mylogin.cnf > other option files
#
# To specify a alternative login path file name, set the MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE environment variable.
# This variable is recognized by mysql_config_editor, by standard MySQL clients and the mysql-test-run.pl testing utility.
#
# Programs use groups in the login path file as follows:
#
# mysql_config_editor operates on the client login path by default if you specify no --login-path=<name> option
# to indicate explicit pathing.
#
# Without a --login-path option - it reads the same groups from other option files as well as the loginpath file.
# i.e default groups pertaining to said command.
#
# With a --login-path option, client programs read the named login path from the login path file.
# The option groups read from other option files remain the same.
#
# mysql --login-path=<mypath>
#
# The mysql client then reads [client] and [mysql] from other option files - whilst reading [client], [mysql] and [mypath] from the login path file.
#
# Client programs read the login path file even when the --no-defaults option is used.
# 
# mysql_config_editor obfuscates the .mylogin.cnf file so it cannot be read as cleartext - and it's contents when obfuscated by client programs
# are used only in memory.
#
# In said way - a PW can be stored in a file in non-cleartext format and used later, without exposing in a Env var or cmd.
# 
# mysql_config_editor does come with a print command as to show login path file contents - but this still omits PWs.
#
# Note: .mylogin.cnf files can be unobfuscated with root privs
#
# The login path file must be readable and writable to the current user - and inaccessible to other users.
# Otherwise, mysql_config_editor ignores it and client programs do not use it either.
#
# To invoke mysql_config_editor:
#
# mysql_config_editor [<program options>] <command> [<command_options>]
#
# If the login path files does not exist - mysql_config_editor creates it.
#
# <program options> : Pertains to general mysql_config_editor options
# <command> : Pertains to what action to perform on the .mylogin.cnf login path file. 
# 				  For example - set writes a login path to the file, remove removes a login path, and print displays login path contents.
# <command_options> : Indicates any additional options specific to the command, such as the login path name and the values to use in the login path.
#
# The position of the command name within the set of program arguments is explicit.
# 
# mysql_config_editor --help set #Interprets it as "--help", ignores the set part
# mysql_config_editor set --help #Interprets it as "set --help" - as in, help command regarding set
#
# Assuming that you wish to have a client login path that defines default connection params - and a separate one for remote,,
# an example:
#
# The following will modify your .mylogin.cnf using set commands:
#
# mysql_config_editor set --login-path=client
# 		--host=localhost --user=localuser --password
# >Prompt for PW to localhost
#
# mysql_config_editor set --login-path=remote
# 		--host=remote.example.com --user=remoteuser --password
# >Prompt for PW to Remote 
#
# We can showcase groupings from the .mylogin.cnf with print --all:
#
# mysql_config_editor print --all
# [client]
# user = localuser
# password = *******
# host = localhost
# [remote]
# user = remoteuser
# password = *******
# host = remote.example.com
#
# If we omit names or --all, it prints client path by default - if there is one.
#
# The login path file can contain multiple login paths.
# A quick example of how to access remote in addition to the stnadard config ones:
#
# mysql --login-path=remote #Reads [client], [mysql] and [remote] groups form login path file
#
# Note: Groups read from later appearances - take precedence over earlier ones appearing.
#
# mysql_config_editor adds login paths to the login path file in the order we create them,
# Thus, more general ones first - more specific ones later on
#
# Ommited values can be appended in terms of specification:
# mysql --login-path=remote --host=remote2.example.com #Assuming that remote yields same login details as the remote2.example.com host, we can just redirect to that specific host
#
# The following are mysql_config_editor General options
#
# mysql_config_editor supports the following general options 
#
# --debug - Write debugging log
# --help - Display help message and exit
# --verbose - Verbose mode

#
# --help, -? - Display a general help message and exit. 
# Example: mysql_config_editor <command> --help
#
# --debug[=<debug options>], - Write a debugging log. A typical <debug_options> string is d:t:o, <file_name>.
#  -# <debug_options> 			 Defaults to d:t:o, /tmp/mysql_config_editor.trace
#
# --verbose, -v - Verbose mode.
#
# --version, -V - Display version info and exit
#
# The following covers:

#
# 			mysql_config_editor <command> --help
# 
# print [<options>] - Print the contents of the login path file in unobfuscated form, with the exception that passwords are displayed as ****.
# 
# 							 The default login path name is <client> if no login path is named.
# 							 If both --all and --login-path are given, --all takes precedence.
#
# 							 The <print> command permits these options following the command name:

#
# 						  --warn, -w - Warn and prompt the user for confirmation if the command attempts to overwrite an existing login path.
# 											On by default - turn off with --skip-warn
#
# The following section pertains to mysqlbinlog - A utility for Processing Binary Log Files
#
# The server's binary log consists of files containing "events" that describe modifications to the DB contents.
# The server writes these files in binary formatting. To display said contents in text - use the mysqlbinlog utility.
#
# You can also use mysqlbinlog to display the contents of relay log files written by a slave server in a replication setup
# because relay logs have the same format as binary logs.
#
# The binary log and relay log are covered later.
#
# Invoke mysqlbinlog as follows:
#
# mysqlbinlog [<options>] <log_file>
#
# To display contents of binary log file binlog.000003:
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000003
#
# The output includes events contained in binlog.000003.
# For statement-based logging, event information includes the SQL statement, the ID of the server on which it
# was executed, timestamp of execution, time taken, etc.
#
# For row-based logging, the event indicates a row change rather than an SQL statement.
#
# Events are preceded by header comments that provide additional information:
#
# # at 141 #Line start or offset in the bin log file
#
# #100309 9:28:36 server id 123 end_log_pos 245 #date, time, server, id, end_log_pos + 1 is where next event will start - timestamp is propagated to slave servers. 
#
#  Query thread_id=3350 exec_time=11 error_code=0 #id of thread, time spent executing the event on the master server. 
#  
#  #On a slave, it is the replication lag behind the master the slave is having. error_code is the raised error - 0 means no error.
#
# When using event groups - the file offset of events may be grouped together and the comments of events may be grouped together.
# Do not mistake these grouped events for blank file offsets.
#
# The output from mysqlbinlog can be re-executed (For example - by using it as input to mysql) - to redo the statements in the log.
# This is useful for recovery operations after a server crash.
#
# Normally - we use mysqlbinlog to read binary log files directly and apply them to the local MySQL server.
# It is also possible to read binary logs from a remote server by using the --read-from-remote-server option.
#
# To read remote binary logs - the connection param options can be given to indicate how to connect to the server.
# These options are --host, --password, --port, --protocol, --socket and --user.
# They are ignored except when you also use the --read-from-remote-server option.
#
# When running mysqlbinlog against a large binary log - be careful that the filesystem has enough space for the
# resulting files.
#
# To configure the directory that mysqlbinlog uses for temp files - use the TMPDIR environment variable.
#
# mysqlbinlog supports the following options, which can be specified on cmd line or in [mysqlbinlog] and [client] groups.

# --verbose 					Reconstruct row events as SQL statements
# --verify-binlog-checksum Verify checksums in binary log
# --version 					Display version info and exit
#
# The following maps the further attributes of some of the above commands:
#
# --help, -? - Display a help message and exit
# --base64-output=<value> - This option determines when events should be displayed encoded as base-64 strings using BINLOG statements.
# 									 The option has these permissible values (not case-sensitive):
#
# 									 AUTO/UNSPEC - displays BINLOG statements automatically when necessary (that is - for format desc. events and row events).
# 														If no --base64-output option is given, the effect is the same as --base64-output=AUTO
#
# 														NOTE: Automatic BINLOG display is the only safe behavior if you intend to use the output of mysqlbinlog 
# 														to re-execute binary log file contents.
#
# 														The other option values are intended only for debugging or testing purposes because they may produce output
# 														that does not include all events in executable form.
#
# 									 NEVER - Causes BINLOG statements not to be displayed. mysqlbinlog exits with an error if a row event is found that must
# 												be displayed using BINLOG.
#
# 									 DECODE-ROWS - Specifies to mysqlbinlog that you intend for row events to be decoded and displayed as commented SQL statements
# 														by also specifying the --verbose option.
#
# 														Like NEVER, DECODE-ROWS suppresses display of BINLOG statements, but unlike NEVER - it does not exit with an error
# 														if a row event is found.
#
# 									 For examples that show the effect of --base64-output and --verbose on row event output.
#
# --bind-address=<ip address> - On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this option to select which interface to use for connecting to the MySQL server.
# --binlog-row-event-max-size=<N> - General syntax formatting and values:
#
# 												Command-Line format - --binlog-row-event-max-size=#
# 												Type 						 Numeric
# 												Default Value 			 4294967040
# 												Minimum Value 			 256
# 												Maximum Value 			 18446744073709547520
# 											
# 												The above values are in bytes. Refers to row-based binary log events size.
# 												Rows are grouped into events smaller than this size if possible.
#
# 												Value should be a multiple of 256 - Defaults to 4GB
#
# --character-sets-dir=<dir name> - The dir where char sets are installed.
#
# --connection-server-id=<server id> - specifies the server ID that mysqlbinlog reports when it connects to the server. 
# 													Can be used to avoid a conflict with the ID of a slave server or another mysqlbinlog process.
#
# 													If the --read-from-remote-server option is specified, mysqlbinlog reports a server ID of 0,
# 													which tells the server to disconnect after sending the last log file (nonblocking behavior)
#
# 													If the --stop-never option is also specified to maintain the connection to the server, mysqlbinlog
# 													reports a server ID of 1 by default instead of 0 - and --connection-server-id can be used to
# 													replace that server ID if required.
#
# --database=<db name>, -d <db_name> - This option causes mysqlbinlog to output entries from the binary log (local log only) that occur
# 													while <db_name> has been selected as the default DB by <USE>.
#
# 													The --database option for mysqlbinlog is similar to the --binlog-do-db option for mysqld, but
# 													can be used to specify only one DB. If --database is given several times, the last one is taken.
#
# 													The effects of this option depend on whether the statement-based or row-based logging format is
# 													in use, in the same way that the effects of --binlog-do-db depend on whether statement-based
# 													or row-based logging is used.
#
# 													Statement-based logging:
#
# 													The --database option works as follows:
#
# 														While <db_name> is the default DB, statements are output whether they modify tables in
# 														<db_name> or a different database.
#
# 														Unless <db_name> is selected as the default DB, statements are not output - even if they modify tables in <db_name>.
#
# 														There is an exception for CREATE DATABASE, ALTER DATABASE and DROP DATABASE. 
# 														The database being created, altered or dropped is considered to be the default database
# 														when determining whether to output the statement.
#
#													Assuming the following base of implementation:
#
# 														INSERT INTO test.t1 (i)  VALUES(100);
# 														INSERT INTO db2.t2 (j) 	 VALUES(200);
# 														USE test;
# 														INSERT INTO test.t1 (i)  VALUES(101);
# 														INSERT INTO t1 (i) 		 VALUES(102);
# 														INSERT INTO db2.t2 (j) 	 VALUES(201);
# 														USE db2;
# 														INSERT INTO test.t1 (i)  VALUES(103);
# 														INSERT INTO db2.t2 (j) 	 VALUES(202);
# 														INSERT INTO t2 (j) 		 VALUES(203);
#
# 													mysqlbinlog --database=test does not output the first two INSERT statements because there is no default DB.
# 													It outputs the three INSERT statements following USE test, but not the three INSERT statements following USE db2.
#
# 													mysqlbinlog --database=db2 does not output the first two INSERT statements because there is no default DB.
# 													It does not output the three INSERT statements after USE.test - but it does output the three after USE db2. (because default usage db2)
#
# 													Row-based logging. mysqlbinlog outputs only entires that change tables belonging to <db_name>.
# 													The default DB has no effect on this. Suppose that the binary log just described was created using
# 													row-based logging rather than statement-based logging.
#
# 													mysqlbinlog --database=test outputs only those entries that modify t1 in the test database, regardless of
# 													whether USE was issued or what the default DB is.
#
# 													If a server is running with binlog format set to MIXED - and we want to use mysqlbinlog with --database option,
# 													the modified tables must be selected by USE. (In particular, no cross-database updates should be used)
#
# 													When used together with the --rewrite-db option, the --rewrite-db option is applied first;
# 													Then the --database option is applied - using the rewritten database name.
#
# 													The order in which the options are provided makes no difference in this regard.
#
# --debug[=<debug options>], 			 	Write a debugging log. A typical <debug_options> string is d:t:o, <file_name>. Defaults to d:t:o, /tmp/mysqlbinlog.trace
#  -# [<debug options>]
#
# --debug-check 								Print debug info when the program exits
#
# --debug-info 								Print debug info, memory and CPU usage stats when exiting
#
# --default-auth=<plugin> 					A hint about the client-side auth plugin to use.
#
# --defaults-extra-file=<file name> 	Read this option file after the global option file, but (on Unix) before the user option file.
# 													Relative if relative, absolute if absolute - error if permissions denied or not found.
#
# --defaults-file=<file name> 			Use only the given option file. Relative if relative, error if non permissible or found. Still reads .mylogin.cnf
#
# --defaults-group-suffix=<str> 			Regex suffix matching in grouping 
#
# --disable-log-bin, -D 					Disable binary logging. Useful for avoiding an endless loop if we use --to-last-log option and we are sending the output
# 													to the same MySQL server.
#
# 													Useful when restoring after a crash to avoid duplication of the statements we logged.
#
# 													Causes mysqlbinlog to include a <SET sql log bin = 0> statement in its output to disable binary
# 													logging of the remaining output.
#
# 													Manipulating the session value of the sql log bin system var is a restricted operation - so 
# 													this requires permissions to set restricted session vars.
#
# --exclude-gtids=<gtid set> 				Do not display any of the groups listed in the <gtid_set>
#
# --force-if-open, -F 						Read binary log files even if they are open or were not closed properly.
#
# --force-read, -f 							With this option, if mysqlbinlog reads a binary log event that it does not recognize
# 													- it prints a warning, ignores the event and continues. Without this option - mysqlbinlog stops reading in such an event.
#
# --get-server-public-key 					Same as otherwise with RSA public key request, applies to clients authenticating caching_sha2_password auth plugin.
#
# --hexdump, -H 								Display a hex dump of the log in comments - can be useful for replicating debugging
#
# --host=<host name>, 						Get the binary log from the MySQL server on the given host.
#  -h <host name>
#
# --idempotent 								Tell the MySQL server to use idempotent mode while processing updates.
# 													Causes suppression of any duplicate-key or key-not-found errors that the server
# 													encounters in the current session while processing updates.
#
# 													May prove useful whenever it is desirable or nessecary to replay one or more binary logs
# 													to a MySQL server which may not contain all of the data to which the logs refer.
#
# 													The scope of effect for this option includes the current mysqlbinlog client and session only.
#
# --include-gtids=<gtid set> 		 		Display only the groups listed in the gtid_set
#
# --local-load=<dir name>,  				Prepare local temporary files for LOAD DATA INFILE in the specified dir.
#  -l <dir_name> 								(These are not automatically removed by any MySQL program)
#
# --login-path=<name> 						Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
# 													This specific option group pertains to connection details to server and account to auth as.
#
# --no-defaults 								Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to reading unknown options from an option file
# 													--no-defaults can be used to prevent them from being read.
#
# 													The exception is that the .mylogin.cnf file, it's always read.
#
# --offset=<N>, -o <N> 						Skip the first N entries in the log.
#
# --password[=<password>], 				The PW to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option (-p) - cannot have space.
#  -p [<password>]  							If value omitted, prompted for one
#
# --plugin-dir=<dir name> 					The dir in which to look for plugins. Specify if --default-auth option is used to specify a auth plugin 
# 													but mysqlbinlog can't find it
#
# --port=<port num>, 						The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a remote server
#  -P <port_num>
#
# --print-defaults 							Print the program name and all the options that it gets from option files.
#
# --print-table-metadata 					Print table related metadata from the binary log. 
# 													Configure the amount of table related metadata binary logged using binlog-row-metadata
#
# --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}  The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server.
# 													
# --raw 											By default, mysqlbinlog reads binary log files and writes events in text format.
# 													The --raw option tells mysqlbinlog to write them in their original binary format.
#
# 													Its use requires that --read-from-remote-server also be used because the files are requested from a server.
#
# 													mysqlbinlog writes one output file for each file read from the server.
# 													The --raw option can be used to make a backup of the Server's binary log.
#
# 													With --stop-never, the backup acts as "live" - because connection is not interuppted.
# 													Defaults to writing to a output file in the CWD with the same name as the original log files.
#
# 													Output file names can be modified using the --result-file 
#
# --read-from-remote-master=<type> 		Read binary logs from a MySQL server with the COM_BINLOG_DUMP or COM_BINLOG_DUMP_GTID commands
# 													by setting the option value to either BINLOG-DUMP-NON-GTIDS or BINLOG-DUMP-GTIDS, respectively.
#
# 													If --read-from-remote-master=<BINLOG-DUMP-GTIDS> is combined with --exclude-gtids - transactions
# 													can be filtered out on the master - avoiding unessecary network traffic.
#
# --read-from-remote-server, -R 			Read the binary log from a MySQL server rather than reading a local log file.
# 													Any connection parameter options are ignored unless this option is given as well.
#
# 													These options are --host, --password, --port, --protocol, --socket and --user.
#
# 													Requires that the remote server is running. Works only for binary log files on the remote server,
# 													not relay log files.
#
# 													This option is equivalent to --read-from-remote-master=BINLOG-DUMP-NON-GTIDS
#
# --result-file=<name>, -r <name> 		Without the --raw option, this option indicates the file to which mysqlbinlog writes text output.
#
# 													With -raw, mysqlbinlog writes one binary output file for each log file transferred from the server,
# 													writing them by default in the CWD using the same name as the original log file.
#
# 													In this case, the --result-file option value is treated as a prefix that modifies output file names.
#
# --rewrite-db='<from name->to name>' 	When reading from a row-based or statement-based log, rewrite all occurrences of <from_name> to <to_name>.
# 													Rewriting is done on the rows, for row-based logs - as well as on the USE clauses, for statement based logs.
#
# 													NOTE: Statements in which table names are qualified with DB names are not rewritten to use the new name when using this option.
#
# 													The rewrite rule employed as a value for this option is a string having the form '<from_name>-><to_name>' as shown previously,
# 													and it must be enclosed ''
#
# 													To employ it multiple times, an example:
#
# 													mysqlbinlog --rewrite-db='dbcurrent->dbold' --rewrite-db='dbtest->dbcurrent' \
# 																	binlog.00001 > /tmp/statements.sql
#
# 													When used together with the --database option, the --rewrite-db option is applied first -
# 													then --database is applied, using the rewritten DB name.
#
# 													In this case, ordering makes no difference.
#
# 													For instance, if mysqlbinlog is started with --rewrite-db='mydb->yourdb' --database=yourdb, then all
# 													updates to any tables in databases mydb and yourdb are included in said output.
#
# 													On the other hand, if it is started with --rewrite-db='mydb->yourdb' --database=mydb, then no outputs are given,
# 													because all updates to mydb are first rewritten as updates to yourdb before applying the --database option
#
# 													Thus no updates are left matching --database=mydb
#
# --server-id=<id> 							Display only events created by the server having the given server ID
#
# --set-charset=<charset name> 			Add a SET NAMES <charset name> statement to the output to specify the char set to be used for processing log files.
#
# --shared-memory-base-name=<name> 		On Windows, the shared-memory name to use for connections made using shared memory to a local server.
# 													Defaults to MySQL. Case-sensitive
#
# 													Server must be started with --shared-memory to enable shared-memory connections
#
# --short-form, -s 							Display only the statements contained in the log, without any extra information or row-based events.
# 													DEPRECATED, DO NOT USE.
#
# --skip-gtids[=(true|false)] 			Do not display any GTIDs in the output. Needed when writing to a dump file from one or more binary logs
# 													containing GTIDs, as shown:
#
# 													mysqlbinlog --skip-gtids binlog.000001 >  /tmp/dump.sql
# 													mysqlbinlog --skip-gtids binlog.000002 >> /tmp/dump.sql
# 													mysql -u root -p -e "source /tmp/dump.sql"
#
# 													Not recommended for production
#
# --socket=<path>, -S <path> 				For connections to localhost, Unix socket file to use or Windows - named pipe to use.
#
# --ssl* 										Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the server using SSL and indicate where to
# 													find SSL keys and certs.
#
# --ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT} 		Controlling FIPS mode on the client side.
#
# --start-datetime=<datetime> 			Start reading the binary log at the first event having a timestamp equal to or later than the <datetime> argument.
# 													The <datetime> value is relative to the local time zone on the machine where you run mysqlbinlog.
#
# 													The value should be in a format accepted for the DATETIME or TIMESTAMP data types.
#
# 													mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="2005-12-25 11:25:56" binlog.000003
#
# 													Useful for point-in-time recovery.
#
# --start-position=<N>, -j <N> 			Start reading the binary log at the first event having a position equal to or greater than <N>.
# 													This option applies to the first log file named on the cmd line.
#
# 													Useful for point-in-time recovery.
#
# --stop-datetime=<datetime> 				Stop reading the binary log at the first event having a timestamp equal to or later than the <datetime> argument.
# 													This option is useful for point-in-time recovery.
#
# --stop-never 								This option is used with --read-from-remote-server. It tells mysqlbinlog to remain connected to the server.
# 													Otherwise mysqlbinlog exits when the last log file has been transferred from the server.
#
# 													--stop-never implies --to-last-log - so only the first log file to transfer needs to be named on the cmd line.
#
# 													--stop-never is commonly used with --raw to make a live binary log backup, but can also be used without --raw
# 													to maintain a continous text display of log events as the server generates them.
#
# 													With --stop-never, by default, mysqlbinlog reports a server ID of 1 when it connects to the server.
# 													Use --connection-server-id to explicitly specify an alternative ID to report. Can be used to
# 													avoid a conflict with the ID of a slave server or another mysqlbinlog.
#
# --stop-never-slave-server-id=<id> 	DEPRECATED, use --connection-server-id instead to specify a server ID for mysqlbinlog to report.
#
# --stop-position=<N> 						Stop reading the binary log at teh first event having a position equal to or greater than <N>.
# 													Applies to the last log file named on the cmd line.
#
# 													Useful for point-in-time recovery.
#
# --tls-version=<protocol list> 			The protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections. Depends on compilated SSL libs relative to MySQL.
#
# --to-last-log, -t 							Do not stop at the end of requested binary log from a MySQL server, but rather continue printing
# 													until the end of the last binary log.
#
# 													If this is sent to the same MySQL server, it causes an endless loop.
#
# 													Requires --read-from-remote-server.
#
# --user=<user name>, -u <user_name> 	The MySQL user name to use when connecting to a remote server
#
# --verbose, -v 								Reconstruct row events and display them as commented SQL statements.
# 													If given twice - output includes comments to indicate column data types, some metadata and row query log events.
#
# --verify-binlog-checksum, -c 			Verify checksums in binary log files.
#
# --version, -V 								Display version info and exit
#
# --open_files_limit=<value> 				Specifies number of open file descriptors to reserve
#
# We can pipe the output of mysqlbinlog into the mysql client to execute the events contained in the binary log.
# This can be done to recover from a crash with a old backup:
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 | mysql -u root -p
#
# or
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.[0-9]* | mysql -u root -p
#
# If the statements produced by mysqlbinlog may contain BLOB values, these may cause problems when mysql processes them.
# In such a case - use mysql with --binary-mode then.
#
# We can also redirect the output of mysqlbinlog to a text file instead - if we need to modify the statement log first
# (for example - to remove statements that we do not want to execute)
#
# Example of redirection:
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 > tmpfile #Redirect unto tmpfile
# <Interlude>
# mysql -u root -p < tmpfile #Redirect from tmpfile to the DB
#
# When mysqlbinlog is invoked with the --start-position option - it displays only those events
# with an offset in the binary log greater than or equal to the given pos. (The pos must align with start of an event)
#
# Thus we can do rollbacks or rollfowards to specific time points - such as roll forward to how the DB was @ a specific time point (in tandem with --stop-datetime)
#
# The following covers how to approaching multiple file integrations: 
#
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 | mysql -u root -p  #Problematic if contains CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement and second uses said table
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p  #The reason why it's an isssue, is that the connection is terminated between the two commands, so tmp table is dropped - have to specify them as 1 command
#
# Example:
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p
#
# Another way is to route log files to a file and then read the file:
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 > /tmp/statements.sql
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 >> /tmp/statements.sql
# mysql -u root -p -e "source /tmp/statements.sql"
#
# As of 8.0.12, you can also supply multiple binary log files to mysqlbinlog as streamed input using a shell pipe.
# An archive of compressed binary log files can be decompressed and provided directly to mysqlbinlog.
#
# In this example, binlog-files_1.gz contains multiple binary log files for processing.
#
# The pipeline extracts the contents of binlog-files_1.gz - pipes the binary log files to mysqlbinlog as standard input,
# and pipes the output of mysqlbinlog into mysql for execution:
#
# gzip -cd binlog-files_1.gz | ./mysqlbinlog - | ./mysql -uroot -p
#
# We can chain more than one archive file:
#
# gzip -cd binlog-files_1.gz binlog-files_2.gz | ./mysqlbinlog - | ./mysql -uroot -p
#
# For streamed input, do not use --stop-position, because mysqlbinlog cannot identify the last log file to apply this option.
#
# LOAD DATA INFILE operations: mysqlbinlog can produce output that reproduces a LOAD DATA INFILE operation without
# the original data file.
#
# mysqlbinlog copies the data to a temp file and writes a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE statement that refers to the file.
# The default location of the dir where said files are written is system-specific.
#
# To specify a dir explicitly, use the --local-load option
#
# Because mysqlbinlog converts LOAD DATA INFILE statements to LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE statements (i.e, it adds LOCAL) - both the client
# and server that you use to process the statements must be configured with the LOCAL capability enabled.
#
# WARNING: The temporary files created for LOAD DATA LOCAL statements are NOT automatically deleted because they are
# 			  needed until you actually execute those statements. You should delete the temporary files yourself after
#  		  you no longer need the statement log. The files can be found in the temporary file dir and have names like:
# 			  <original_file_name-#-#>
#
# The following covers mysqlbinlog Hex Dump Format
#
# The --hexdump option causes mysqlbinlog to produce a hex dump of the binary log contents:
#
# 	mysqlbinlog --hexdump master-bin.000001
#
# The hex output consists of comment lines beginning with #, it might look as follows:
#
# /* !40019 SET @@session.max_insert_delayed_threads=0*/;
# /* !50003 SET @@OLD_COMPLETION_TYPE=@@COMPLETION_TYPE, COMPLETION_TYPE=0*/;
# at 4
# 051024 17:24:13 server id 1 end_log_pos 98
# Position 	Timestamp 	Type 		Master ID 		Size 		Master Pos 	  Flags
# <                    Hexadecimal outputs           >   62 00 00 00   00 00
# < 						  Hexadecimal outputs 			  >   |..5.0.15.debug.l|
# etc.
# 		Start: binlog v 4, server v 5.0.15-debug-log created 051024 17:24:13
# 		at startup
# ROLLBACK;
#
# The hex dump output contains the elements in the following list: (This might change)
#
# Position: The byte pos within the log file
# Timestamp: The event timestamp. In the example shown, '9d fc 5c 43' is the representation of '051024 17:24:13' in hexadecimal
# Type: The event type code
# Master ID: The server ID of the master that created the event
# Size: The size in bytes of the event
# Master Pos: The position of the next event in the original master log file.
# Flags: Event flag values.
#
# The following covers mysqlbinlog Row Event Displays:
#
# The following examples illustrate how mysqlbinlog displays row events that specify data modifications.
# These correspond to events with the WRITE_ROWS_EVENT, UPDATE_ROWS_EVENT and DELETE_ROWS_EVENT type codes.
#
# The --base64-output=DECODE-ROWS and --verbose options may be used to affect row event output.
#
# Suppose that the server is using row-based binary logging and that you execute the following sequence of statements:
#
# CREATE TABLE t
# (
# 	 id 	INT NOT NULL,
# 	 name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
#   date DATE NULL,
# ) ENGINE = InnoDB;
#
# START TRANSACTION;
# INSERT INTO t VALUES(1, 'apple', NULL);
# UPDATE t SET name = 'pear', date = '2009-01-01' WHERE id = 1;
# DELETE FROM t WHERE id = 1;
# COMMIT;
#
# By default, mysqlbinlog displays row events encoded as base-64 strings using BINLOG statements.
# Omitting extraneous lines, the output for the row events produced by the preceding statement sequences might look as follows:
#
# mysqlbinlog <log_file>

# You can tell mysqlbinlog to suppress the BINLOG statements for row events by using the --base64-output=<DECODE-ROWS> option.

#
# NOTE: You should not suppress BINLOG statements if you intend to re-execute mysqlbinlog output
#
# The SQL statements produced by --verbose for row events are much more readable than the corresponding BINLOG statements.
# However, they do not correspond exactly to the original SQL statements that generated the events.
#
# The following limitations apply:
#
# The original column names are lost and replaced by @N where N is the column number
# 
# Character set information is not available in the binary log, which affects string column display:
# 		
# 		There is no distinction made between corresponding binary and nonbinary string types (BINARY and CHAR, VARBINARY and VARCHAR, BLOB and TEXT)
#     The output uses a data type of STRING for fixed-length strings and VARSTRING for variable-length strings.
#
# 		For multibyte char sets, the max number of bytes per character is not present in the binary log, so the length for string
# 		types is displayed in bytes rather than in characters. For example, STRING(4) will be used as the data type for values from either
#     of these column types:
#
# 		CHAR(4) 	CHARACTER SET latin1
# 		CHAR(2) 	CHARACTER SET ucs2
#
# 		Due to the storage format for events of type UPDATE_ROWS_EVENT, UPDATE statements are displayed with the WHERE clause preceding the SET clause.
# 
# Proper interpretation of row events requires the information from the format description event at the beginning of the binary log.
#
# Because mysqlbinlog does not know in advance whether the rest of the log contain rows row events, by default it displays the format
# description event using a BINLOG statement in the initial part of the output.
#
# If the binary log is known not to contain any events requiring a BINLOG statement (that is, no row events) - the --base64-output=NEVER option can be 
# used to prevent this header from being written.
#
# The following covers using mysqlbinlog to Back Up Binary Log Files
#
# By default, mysqlbinlog reads binary log files and displays their contents in text format. This enables you
# to examine events within the files more easily and to re-execute them (For example - by using the output as input to mysql)
#
# mysqlbinlog can read log files directly from the local file system, or, with the --read-from-remote-server option
# - it can connect to a server and request binary log contents from that server.
#
# mysqlbinlog writes text output to its standard output - or to the file named as the value of the --result-file=<file name> option
# if that option is given.
#
# mysqlbinlog can read binary log files and write new files containing the same content - that is, in binary
# format rather than text format.
#
# This capability enables you to easily back up a binary log in its original format. mysqlbinlog can make a static
# backup, backing up a set of log files and stopping when the end of the last file is reached.
#
# It can also make a continuous ("live") backup - staying connected to the server when it reaches the end of the last log
# file and continuing to copy new events as they are generated.
#
# In continuous-backup operation, mysqlbinlog runs until the connection ends (for example - when the server exits) or mysqlbinlog
# is forcibly terminated. When the connection ends, mysqlbinlog does not wait and retry the connection - unlike a slave replication server.
#
# To continue a live backup after the server has been restarted - you must also restart mysqlbinlog.
#
# Binary log backup requires that you invoke mysqlbinlog with two options at minimum:
#
# 		The --read-from-remote-server (or -R) option tells mysqlbinlog to connect to a server and request its binary log.
# 				(This is similar to a slave replication server connecting to its master server)
#
# 		The --raw option tells mysqlbinlog to write raw (binary) output, not text output
#
# Along with --read-from-remote-server - it is common to specify other options: --host indicates where the server
# is running and you may also need to specify connection options such as --user and --password
#
# Several other options are useful in conjunction with --raw:
#
# 		--stop-never: Stay connected to the server after reaching the end of the last log file and continue to read new events
#
# 		--connection-server-id=<id>: The server ID that mysqlbinlog reports when it connects to a server. 
# 											  When --stop-never is used, the default reported server ID is 1.
# 											  If this causes a conflict with the ID of a slave server or another mysqlbinlog process,
# 											  use --connection-server-id to specify an alternative server ID.
#
# 		--result-file: A prefix for output file names, as described later.
#
# To back up a server's binary log files with mysqlbinlog, you must specify file names that actually exist on the server.
# If you do not know the names, connect to the server and use the SHOW BINARY LOGS statement to see the current names.
#
# Suppose that the statement produces this output:
#
# 	SHOW BINARY LOGS;
# 	
# 		Log_name 			File_size
# 	 binlog.000130 		27459
#   binlog.000131 		13719
# 	 binlog.000132 		43268
#
# With that information, you can use mysqlbinlog to back up the binary log to the current dir as follows (enter each command on a single line):
#
# 		To make a static backup of binlog.000130 through binlog.000132, use either of the following commands:
#
# 			mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server --host=host_name --raw
# 				binlog.000130 binlog.000131 binlog.000132
#
# 			mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server --host=host_name --raw
# 				--to-last-log binlog.000130
#
# 		The first command specifies every file name explicitly. The second names only the first file and uses --to-last-log
# 		to read through the last.
#
# 		A difference between these commands is that if the server happens to open binlog.000130 before mysqlbinlog reaches the
# 		end of binlog.000132, the first command will not read it - but the second will.
#
# 		To make a live backup in which mysqlbinlog starts with binlog.000130 to copy existing log files - then stays
# 		connected to copy new events as the server generates them:
#
# 			mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server --host=host_name --raw --stop-never binlog.000130
#
# 		With --stop-never, it is not nessecary to specify --to-last-log to read to the last log file because that option is implied.
#
# The following pertains to Output File Naming
#
# Without --raw, mysqlbinlog produces text output and the --result-file option, if given - specifies the name of the single file
# to which all output is written.
#
# With --raw, mysqlbinlog writes one binary output file for each log file transferred from the server.
# By default, mysqlbinlog writes the files in the current directory with the same name as the original log files.
#
# To modify the output file names, use the --result-file option. In conjunction with --raw, the --result-file option
# value is treated as a prefix that modifies the output file names.
#
# Suppose that a server currently has binary log files named binlog.000999 and up.
# If you use mysqlbinlog --raw to back up the files, the --result-file option produces
# output file names as shown soon.
#
# You can write the files to a specific directory by beginning the --result-file value with the directory path.
# If the --result-file value consists only of a directory name - the value must end with the pathname separator char.
#
# Output files are overwritten if they exist:
#
# 	--result-file OPTION 		OUTPUT FILE NAMES
# --result-file=x 				xbinlog.000999 and up
# --result-file=/tmp/ 			/tmp/binlog.000999 and up
# --result-file=/tmp/x 			/tmp/xbinlog.000999 and up
#
# The following is an example of using mysqldump + mysqlbinlog for Backup and Restore
#
# The following example describes a simple scenario that shows how to use mysqldump and mysqlbinlog together to back
# up a server's data and binary log - and how to use the backup to restore the server if data loss happens.
#
# The example assumes that the server is running on host <host_name> and its first binary log file is named
# binlog.000999. 
#
# Make a continous backup of the bin log:
#
# mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server --host=host_name --raw
# 	--stop-never binlog.000999
#
# We can also use mysqldump to make a dump file which acts as a snapshot of the server's data.
#
# Use --all-databases, --events, and --routines to back up all data and --master-data=2 to include the
# current bin log co-ords in the dump file.
#
# mysqldump --host=host_name --all-databases --events --routines --master-data=2> <dump_file> #Select all the data, include binary log co-ords in the dump
#
# We can execute above to make snaphots. 
#
# To restore by usage of a dump file:
#
# mysql --host=host_name -u root -p < <dump_file>
#
# Assuming the binlog file looks as follows:
#
# -- CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='binlog.001002', MASTER_LOG_POS=27284;
#
# If the most recent is binlog.001004, you can re-execute log events as follows:
#
# mysqlbinlog --start-position=27284 binlog.001002 binlog.001003 binlog.001004 | mysql --host=host_name -u root -p
#
# We may also copy the backup files to the server, if we do not have root access.
#
# The following covers how to Specify mysqlbinlog Server ID
#
# When invoked with the --read-from-remote-server option, mysqlbinlog connects to a MySQL server,
# specifies a server ID to identify itself - requests binary log files.
#
# We can use mysqlbinlog to request log files from a server in several ways:
#
# Specify an explicit named set of files: For each file, mysqlbinlog connects and issues a Binlog dump command.
# The server sends the file and disconnects. There is one connection per file.
#
# Specify the beginning file and --to-last-log: mysqlbinlog connects and issues a Binlog dump command for all files.
# The server sends all the files and disconnects.
#
# Specify the beginning file and --stop-never (implies --to-last-log): mysqlbinlog connects and issues a Binlog dump
# command for all files. The server sends all files - but does not disconnect after sending the last one.
#
# If we use --read-from-remote-server only - mysqlbinlog connects using a server ID of 0 - which tells the server to disconnect
# after sending the last requested log file.
#
# With --read-from-remote-server and --stop-never, mysqlbinlog connects using a nonzero server ID, so the server does not
# disconnect after sending the last log file. The server ID is 1 by default, but can be changed with --connection-server-id.
#
# Thus, for the first two ways of requesting files, the server disconnects because mysqlbinlog specifies a server ID of 0.
# Does not disconnect if --stop-never is given because mysqlbinlog specifies a nonzero server ID.
#
# The following covers mysqldumpslow - Summarizing Slow Query Log Files
#
# The MySQL slow query log contains info about queries that take a long time to execute.
# mysqldumpslow parses MySQL slow query log files and prints a summary of their contents.
#
# Normally - mysqldumpslow groups queries that are similar except for the particular values of number and
# string data values. It "abstracts" these values to N and 'S' when displaying summary output.
#
# The -a and -n options can be used to modify value abstracting behavior.
#
# Invoke as follows:
#
# mysqldumpslow [<options>] [<log_file> ...]
#
# The following options pertain to mysqldumpslow:
#
# -a 		   Do not abstract all numbers to N and strings to S
# -n 		   Abstract numbers with at least the specified digits
# --debug   Write debug information
# -g 		   Only consider statements that match the pattern
# --help    Display help message and exit
# -h 		   Host name of the server in the log file name
# -i 		   Name of the server instance
# -l 		   Do not subtract lock time from total time
# -r 		   Reverse the sort order
# -s 		   How to sort output
# -t 		   Display only first num queries
# --verbose Verbose mode
#
# The following covers dynamics in more detail:
#
# --help - Display help message and exit
# -a - Do not abstract all numbers to N and strings to 'S'
# --debug, -d - Run in debug mode
# -g <pattern> - Consider only queries that match the (grep-style) pattern
# -host, <host_name> - Host name of the MySQL server for *-slow.log file name.
# 							  Can contain wildcard. Default wildcard is *
# -i <name> - Name of server instance (if using mysql.server startup script)
# -l - Do not subtract lock time from total time
# -n <N> - Abstract numbers with at least <N> digits within names
# -r - Reverse the sort order
# -s <sort_Type> - How to sort the output. The value of <sort_type> should be chosen from the following list:
# 						
# 						 		t, at: Sort by query time or average query time
# 								l, al: Sort by lock time or average lock time
# 								r, ar: Sort by rows sent or average rows sent
# 								c: Sort by count
#
# 								By default, it sorts by average query time (same as -s at)
#
# -t <N> - Display only the first <N> queries in the output.
# --verbose, -v - Verbose mode. 
#
# Example output:
#
# mysqldumpslow
#
# Reading mysql slow query log from /usr/local/mysql/data/mysqld51-apple-slow.log
# Count: 1 	Time=4.32s (4s) 	Lock=0.00s 	(0s) 		Rows=0.0 (0), 	root[root]@localhost
# 	insert into t2 select * from t1
#
# Count: 3 Time=2.53s (7s) Lock=0.00s (0s) 		Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
# 	insert into t2 select * from t1 limit N
#
# Count: 3 Time=2.13s (6s) Lock=0.00s (0s) 		Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
# 	insert into t1 select * from t1
#
# The following covers MySQL Program Development Utilities
#
# In shell scripts, you can use the my_print_defaults program to parse option files and 
# see what options would be used by a given program.
#
# The following example shows the output that my_print_defaults might produce when asked to show
# the options found in the [client] and [mysql] groups:
#
# my_print_defaults client mysql
# --port=3306
# --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
# --no-auto-rehash
#
# Option file handling is implemented in the C client lib simply by processing all options in the
# appropiate group or groups before any CMDline args.
#
# The following pertains to mysql_config - A utility to display options for Compiling Clients
#
# mysql_config provides you with useful information for compiling your MySQL client and connecting it to MySQL.
# It's a shell script.
#
# Note: pkg-config can be used as an alternative to mysql_config for obtaining info such as compiler flags
# or link libraries required to compile MySQL apps.
#
# mysql_config supports the following:
#
# --cflags - C compiler flags to find include files and critical compiler flags - defines used when compiling the libmysqlclient lib.
# 				 The options returned are tied to the specific compiler that was used when the library was created and might 
# 				 clash with the settings for your own compiler.
#
# 				 Using --include is more integratable in relation to portable options that contain only include paths.
#
# --cxxflags - Like -cflags, but for C++ compiler flags
#
# --include - Compiler options to find MySQL include files
#
# --libs - Libs and options required to link with the MySQL client lib.
#
# --libs r - Libs and options required to link with the thread-safe MySQL client lib.
# 				 In MySQL 8.0, all client libs are thread-safe. --libs can be used in all cases.
#
# --plugindir - Default plugin dir path name, defined when configuring MySQL
#
# --port - Default TCP/IP port number, defined when configuring MySQL
#
# --socket - Default Unix socket file, defined when configuring MySQL
#
# --variable=<var_name> - Display the value of the named config variable. 
# 								  Permitted <var_name> values are pkgincludedir (header file dir),
# 						        pkglibdir (the lib dir),
# 								  plugindir (the plugin dir)
#
# --version - Version number for MySQL distri
#
# If you invoke mysql_config with no options, it displays a list of all options that it supports and their values:
#
# mysql_config
# Usage: 	/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config [options]
# Options:
# 	--cflags 		[-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
#  --cxxflags 		[-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
#  --include 		[-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql]
# 	--libs 			[-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient
# 						 -lpthread -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl]
#  --libs_r 		[-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient_r
# 						 -lpthread -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl]
#  --plugindir 	[/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin]
# 	--socket 		[/tmp/mysql.sock]
# 	--port 			[3306]
#  --version 		 [5.8.0-m17]
#  --variable=<VAR> VAR is one of :
# 			pkgincludedir 	[/usr/local/mysql/include]
# 			pkglibdir 		[/usr/local/mysql/lib]
# 			plugindir 		[/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin]
#
# We can use mysql_config within a CMD line using backticks to include output for particular options.
# For example, we can compile and link a MySQL client program as follows:
#
# gcc -c `mysql_config --cflags` progname.c
# gcc -o progname progname.o `mysql_config --libs`
#
# The following pertains to my_print_defaults - Used for Display Options from Option Files
#
# my_print_defaults displays the options that are present in option groups of option files. 
# The output indicates what options will be used by programs that read the specified option
# groups.
#
# For example, the mysqlcheck program reads the [mysqlcheck] and [client] option groups.
# To see what options are present in thoose groups in the standard option files, invoke the
# my_print_defaults as follows:
#
# my_print_defaults mysqlcheck client
# --user=myusername
# --password=password
# --host=localhost
#
# The output consists of options - one a line.
#
# The following options are supported in terms of my_print_defaults:
#
# --help, -? - Display a help message and exit
#
# --config-file=<file name>, - Read only the given option file
# --defaults-file=<file name>,
#  -c <file_name>
#
# --debug=<debug options>, - Write a debugging log. A typical <debug_options> string is d:t:o, <file_name>.
#  -# <debug_options> 		  Defaults to d:t:o, /tmp/my_print_defaults.trace
#
# --defaults-extra-file=<file name>, - Read this option file after global option file (but on Unix) before the user option file.
# --extra-file=<file name>,
#  -e <file_name>
#
# --defaults-group-suffix=<suffix>, - Suffix regex match option groups
#  -g <suffix>
# --login-path=<name>, - Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login path file.
#  -L <name>
# --no-defaults, -n - Return an empty string
# --show, -s - my_print_defaults masks PWs by default. Use this to display in cleartext.
# --verbose, -v - Verbose mode.
# --version, -V - Version info and exit
#
# The following pertains to resolve_stack_dump - Used to resolve Numeric Stack Trace Dump to Symbols
#
# resolve_stack_dump resolves a numeric stack dump to symbols.
#
# Invoke:
#
# resolve_stack_dump [<options>] <symbols_file> [<numeric_dump_file>]
#
# The symbols file should include the output from the nm --numeric-sort mysqld command.
# The numeric dump file should contain a numeric stack track from mysqld.
# If no numeric dump file is named on the command line, the stack trace is read from the standard input.
#
# resolve_stack_dump supports the following options:
#
# --help, -h - Display a help message and exit.
# --numeric-dump-file=<file name>, -n <file_name> - Read the stack trace from the given file.
# --symbols-file=<file name>, -s <file_name> - Use the given symbols file.
# --version, -V - Display version info and exit.
#
# The following covers lz4_decompress - Decompress mysqlpump LZ4-Compressed Output
#
# The lz4_decompress utility decompresses mysqlpump output that was created using LZ4 compression.
#
# NOTE: If MySQL was configured with the -DWITH LZ4=system option, lz4_decompress is not built.
# 	     In this case, the system lz4 command can be used instead.
#
# Invoke lz4_decompress like this:
# lz4_decompress <input_file> <output_file>
#
# Example of usage:
#
# mysqlpump --compress-output=LZ4 > dump.lz4
# lz4_decompress dump.lz4 dump.txt
#
# To see help messages in relation to lz4_decompress, run it with no args.
# To decompress mysqlpump ZLIB-compressed output, use zlib_decompress.
#
# The following pertains to perror - Which displays error messages:
#
# perror displays the error message for MySQL or operating system error codes.
#
# perror [<options>] <errorcode> ...
#
# perror attempts to be flexible in understanding args. For example - 
#
# ER WRONG VALUE FOR VAR - can be translated as 1231, 001231, MY-1231 or MY-001231 or ER WRONG VALUE FOR VAR
#
# shell>perror 1231
# MySQL error code MY-001231 (ER_WRONG_VALUE_FOR_VAR): Variable '%-.64s' can't be set to the value of '%-.200s'
#
# If a error number is in the range where MySQL and OS sys errors overlap, perror displays both error messages:
# 
# perror 1 13
# OS error code 1: Operation not permitted
# MySQL error code MY-000001: Can't create/write to file '%s' (OS errno %d - %s)
# OS error code 13: Permission denied
# MySQL error code MY-000013: Can't get stat of '%s' (OS errno %d - %s)
#
# To obtain the error message for a MySQL Cluster error code, invoke perror with the --ndb option:
#
# perror --ndb <errorcode>
#
# The meaning of system error messages may be dependent on the OS. 
#
# perror supports the following options:
#
# --help, --info, -I, -? - Display a help message and exit
# --ndb - print the error message for a MySQL Cluster error code
# --silent, -s - Silent mode. Print only the error message
# --verbose, -v - Verbose mode
# --version, -V - Version info and exit
#
# The following covers the dynamics of resolveip - Resolve Host name to IP Address or Vice Versa
#
# The resolveip utility resolves host names to IP addresses and vice versa.
#
# Invoke as follows:
#
# resolveip [<options>] {<host_name>|<ip-addr>} ...
#
# Supports the following options:
#
# --help, --info, -?, -I - Display a help message and exit
# --silent, -s - Silent mode.
# --version, -V - Display version info and exit.
#
# The following options cover zlib_decompress - Decompress mysqlpump ZLIB-Compressed Output
#
# The zlib_decompress utility decompresses mysqlpump output that was created using ZLIB compression.
#
# Note: If we configured MySQL with the -DWITH ZLIB=system option, zlib_decompress is not built.
# 		  Then we can use openssl zlib instead.
#
# To use zlib_decompress:
#
# zlib_decompress <input_file> <output_file>
#
# Example:
#
# mysqlpump --compress-output=ZLIB > dump.zlib
# zlib_decompress dump.zlib dump.txt
#
# To see a help message, just run zlib_decompress with no args.
#
# To decompress mysqlpump LZ4-compressed output, use lz4_decompress.
#

# MYSQL_HISTIGNORE 						Patterns specifying statements that mysql should not log to $HOME/.mysql_history or syslog if --syslog is given
#
# MYSQL_HOME 								The path to the dir in which the server-specific my.cnf file resides
# MYSQL_HOST 								Default host name used by the mysql cmd line client

# MYSQL_PS1 								The cmd prompt to use use in the mysql cmd line 
# MYSQL_PWD 								The default PW when connecting to mysqld. Insecure.
# MYSQL_TCP_PORT 							Default TCP/IP port number
# MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE 				The name of the .mylogin.cnf login path file
# MYSQL_TEST_TRACE_CRASH 				Whether the test protocol trace plugin crashes clients.
# MYSQL_TEST_TRACE_DEBUG 				Whether the test protocol trace plugin produces output.
# MYSQL_UNIX_PORT 						The default Unix socket file name, used for connections to localhost
# MYSQLX_TCP_PORT 						The X plugin default TCP/IP port number
#
# MYSQLX_UNIX_PORT 						The X Plugin default Unix socket file name; used for connections to localhost
# NOTIFY_SOCKET 							Socket used by mysqld to communicate with systemd
# PATH 										Used by the shell to find MySQL programs.
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH 						Location of mysqlclient.pc pkg-config file.
# TMPDIR 									The dir in which temp files are created.
# TZ 											Should be set to your local time zone
# UMASK 										The user-file creation mode when creating files
# UMASK_DIR 								The user-directory creation mode when creating dirs
# USER 										The default user name on Windows when connecting to Mysqld
#
# MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE is the path name of the login path file (the file created by mysql_config_editor).
#
# If not set, the default value is %APPDATA%\MySQL\.mylogin.cnf dir on Windows and $HOME/.mylogin.cnf on non Windows OS's
#
# The MYSQL_TEST_TRACE_DEBUG and MYSQL_TEST_TRACE_CRASH vars control the test protocol trace client plugin,
# if MySQL is built with that plugin enabled.
#
# The default UMASK and UMASK_DIR values are 0640 and 0750, respectively.
#
# MySQL assumes that the value for UMASK or UMASK_DIR is in octal if it starts with a zero.
# For example, setting UMASK=0600 is equivalent to UMASK=384 because 0600 Octal is 384 decimal.
#
# UMASK and UMASK_DIR, are not masks, they are modes.
#
# If UMASK is set, mysqld uses ($UMASK | 0600) as the mode for file creation, so that newly created files have a mode in the range
# from 0600 to 0666 (octal values)
#
# If UMASK_DIR is set, mysqld uses ($UMASK_DIR | 0700) as the base mode for dir creation, which is AND supplemented with ~(~$UMASK & 0666)
# so that newly created dirs have a mode in the range from 0700 to 0777.
#
# The AND may remove read and write permissions from the dir mode, but not execute permissions.
#
# We might need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH if we use pkg-config in terms of MySQL programs
#
# The following covers MySQL Server Administration
#
# MySQL Server (mysqld) is the main program that does most of the work in a MySQL installation.

# The server shutdown process. Performance and reliability considerations depending on type of table (transactional or nontransactional) and whether to use replication.
#
# NOTE: Not all storage engines are supported by all MySQL server bins and configs.
#
# The following section covers how to configure the Server.
#
# The MySQL server, mysqld has many command options and system vars that can be set at startup to configure its operation.
# To determine the default command option and system var values used by the server:
#
# mysqld --verbose --help
#
# The command produces a list of all mysqld options and config system vars. 
# Its output includes the default option and var values, might look like:
#
# abort-slave-event-count 			0
# allow-suspicious-udfs 			FALSE
# archive 								ON
# auto-increment-increment 		1
# auto-increment-offset 			1
# autocommit 							TRUE
# automatic-sp-privileges 			TRUE
# avoid-temporal-upgrade 			FALSE
# back-log 								80
# basedir 								/home/jon/bin/mysql-8.0/
# ...
# tmpdir 								/tmp
# transaction-alloc-block-size 	8192
# transaction-isolation 			REPEATABLE-READ
# transaction-prealloc-size 		4096
# transaction-read-only 			FALSE
# transaction-write-set-extraction OFF
# updatable-views-with-limit 		YES
# validate-user-plugins 			TRUE
# verbose 								TRUE
# wait-timeout 						28800
#
# To see the system vars in use on the server:
#
# SHOW VARIABLES;
#
# To see some stats and status indicators for a running server:
#
# SHOW STATUS;
#
# We can also see system vars and status through mysqladmin:
#
# mysqladmin variables
# mysqladmin extended-status
#
# Options set on cmd line are only in effect for that session, for permanance use OPtion files.
#
# The following pertains to Server Configuration Defaults:
#
# The MySQL server has many operating params, which you can change at server startup using cmd line options or config files.
# We can also change params at runtime.
#
# On Windows, the MySQL installer interacts with the user and creates a file named my.ini in the base install dir as the default option file
#
# NOTE: The extension on Windows might not be displayed (in terms of .ini or .cnf)
#
# After completing the installation process, you can edit the default option file at any time to modify the params.
#
# On non Windows, no default option file is made in terms of installation. Without a option file, it just runs with defaults.
# 
# The following pertains to Server Options, System vars and Status Vars
#
# The following contains all cmd line options, system vars, and status vars within mysqld.
#

# mysqld reads options from the [mysqld] and [server] groups.
# mysqld_safe reads options from the [mysqld], [server], [mysqld_safe] and [safe_mysqld] groups.
#
# mysql.server reads options from the [mysqld] and [mysql.server] groups
#
# Memory allocations in size and defaulting is dependant upon platform.
#
# Values default to bytes in memory allocations in terms of buffer sizes, lengths, and stack sizes - unless specified otherwise.
#
# Note: Values are hints - MySQL retains freedom in assignments.
#
# 		Property 					 
# --allow-suspicious-udfs 		 					 						  
# 
#   cmd-line format - --allow-suspicious-udfs 
# 	 Type 				 Boolean
#   Default Value 	 FALSE
#
# 	 Controls whether user-defined functions that have only an xxx symbol for the main function can be loaded.
#   By default - is off and only UDFs that have at least one auxilliary symbol can be loaded; prevents attempts at loading
# 	 functions from shared object files other than those containing legit UDFs.
#
# --ansi
# 
# 	 cmd-line format 	--ansi
#
# 	 Use standard (ANSI) SQL Syntax instead of MySQL syntax. 
#   For more precise control over the server SQL mode - use --sql-mode instead.
#
# --basedir=<dir name>, -b <dir name>
#
# 	 cmd-line format 			--basedir=dir_name
# 	 System Var 				basedir
# 	 Scope 						Global
# 	 Dynamic 				 	No
# 	 SET_VAR Hint Applies  	No
#   Type 						Dir name
#   Default (>= 8.0.2) 		parent of mysqld installation dir
#   Default (<= 8.0.1) 		configuration-dependent default
#
# 	 The path to the MySQL installation dir. This option sets the basedir system var.
#
# 	 The server executable determines its own full path name at startup and uses the parent of the dir in which
# 	 it is located as the default basedir value.
#
# 	 This in turn enables the server to use that basedir when searching for server-related info such as the share dir containing error messages.
#
# --big-tables
#

# 	System var 					big_tables
# 	Scope 						Global, Session
# 	Dynamic 						Yes
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 	Type 							Boolean
# 	Default 						OFF
#
# 	Enable large result sets by saving all temp sets in files. This option prevents most 
# 	"table full" errors, but also slows down queries for which in-memory tables would suffice.
#
# 	The server is able to handle large result sets automatically by using memory for smaller temp tables and
#  switching to disk tables where necessary.
#
# --bind-address=<addr>
#
# cmd-line format 			--bind-address=addr
# System var 					bind_address
# Scope 							Global
# Dynamic 						No
# SET_VAR Hint Applies 		No
# Type 							String
# Default to 					*
#
# The MySQL server listens on one or more network sockets for TCP/IP connections.
# Each socket is bound to one address - but it is possible for an address to map onto
# multiple network interfaces.
#
# To specify how the server should listen for TCP/IP connections, use the --bind-address option at server startup
#
# < 8.0.13 - Accepts a single address value, which may specify a single non-wildcard IP address or host name, or one of the
#  			 wildcard address formats that permit listening on multiple network interfaces (*, 0.0.0.0 or ::)
#
# >= 8.0.13 - accepts a single value as just described, or a list of comma-separated values. When the opption names a list of
#  			  multiple values, each value must specify a single non-wildcard IP address or host name - i.e NONE may have (*, 0.0.0.0, or ::)
#
# IPs can be specified as IPv4 or IPv6. For any option that is a host name - the server resolves the name to an IP and binds to that address.
# If a host name resolves to multiple IP addresses, the server uses the first IPv4 address if there are any, or the first IPv6 address otherwise.
#
# The server treats different types of addresses as follows:
#
# 		If the address is *, the server accepts TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4 interfaces - and IPv6 if supported.
# 		This is the default behavior.  - If multiple values are specified, this is not allowed as a value.
#
# 		If the address is 0.0.0.0, the server accepts TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4 interfaces. Not permitted with a list of several values.
#
# 		If the address is ::, the server accepts TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Not permitted with a list of several values.
#
# 		If the address is an IPv4-mapped address, the server accepts TCP/IP connections for that address - in either IPv4 or IPv6.
#	 	Example: If server is bound to ::ffff:127.0.0.1 - Clients can connect using --host=127.0.0.1 or --host=::ffff:127.0.0.1
#
# 		If the address is a regular IPv4 or IPv6 address - such as 127.0.0.1 or ::1, the server accepts TCP/IP only for that IPv4 or IPv6.
#
# 		If binding to any address fails, server procedure fails and does not start.
#
# 		Some examples:
#
# 		--bind-address=* - Listens on all IPv4 or IPv6 - specified by *
#
# 		--bind-address=198.51.100.20 - Listens only on the 198.51.100.20 IPv4 address.
#
# 		--bind-address=198.51.100.20, 2001:db8:0:f101::1 - The server listens on the 198.51.100.20 IPv4 and 2001:db8:0:f101::1 IPv6
#
# 		--bind-address=198.51.100.20,* - Produces an error, Can't use wildcards with multiple designated values.
#
# 		When --bind-address names a single value (wildcard or non-wildcard) - the server listens on a single socket, which for a wildcard
# 		address may be bound to multiple network interfaces. 
#
# 		When it lists multiple values - the server listens on one socket per value - with each socket bound to a single network
# 		interface. This scaling is linear, i.e 1:1. Can come to affect connection-acceptance efficiency depending on the OS - long lists can cause overhead.
#
# 		If we intend to bind the server to a specific address - the mysql.user grant table must contain an account with admin privs that can connect to that 
# 		address.
#
# 		Otherwise - we cannot shut down the server. For example - if we bind the server to * - we can connect to it using all existing accounts.
# 		But if we bind to ::1, we'd need admin privs on root in terms of ::1 - as in 'root'@'::1' exists in the mysql.user table.
#
# --binlog-format={ROW|STATEMENT|MIXED}
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--binlog-format=format
# 		System var: 			binlog_format
# 		Scope 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Enumeration
# 		Defaults: 				ROW
# 		Can take: 				ROW, STATEMENT, MIXED
#
# 		Specify wether to use row-based, statement-based or mixed replication. Statement is default in >= 8.0
#
# 	 	Sometimes the var cannot be changed during runtime - or causes replication to fail.
#
# 		Setting the binary logging format without enabling binary logging sets the binlog format global sys var and logs a warning.
# 
# --character-sets-dir=<dir name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--character-sets-dir=dir_name
# 		Sys Var: 				character_sets_dir
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic 					No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Dir name
#
# 		The dir where char sets are installed
#
# --character-set-client-handshake
# 
# 		cmd line format: 		--character-set-client-handshake
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Defaults: 				TRUE
#
# 		Do not ignore char set info sent by the client. 
# 		To ignore client info and use the default server char set, use --skip-character-set-client-handshake.
# 		(Causes behavior akin to MySQL 4.0)
#
# --character-set-filesystem=<charset name>
# 		
# 		cmd line format: 		--character-set-filesystem=name
# 		System Var: 			character_set_filesystem
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Defaults: 				Binary
#
# 		The filesystem char set. Sets the char set filesystem System var.
#
# --character-set-server=<charset name>, -C <charset_name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--character-set-server
# 		System var: 			character_set_server
# 		Scope: 					global, session
#		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default (>= 8.0.1): 	utf8mb4
# 		Default (8.0.0): 		latin1
#
# 		Use <charset_name> as the default server char set. To specify a nondefault char set - use --collation-server to specify the collation.
#
# --chroot=<dir name>, -r <dir_name>
#
# 	 	cmd line format: 		--chroot=dir_name
# 		Type: 					Dir name
#
# 		Put the mysqld server in a closed env during startup by using the chroot() system call.
# 		Recommended security measure - limits interaction of LOAD_DATA_INFILE and SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE
#
# --collation-server=<collation_name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--collation-server
# 		System var: 			collation_server
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default (>= 8.0.1) 	utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
# 		Default (8.0.0) 		latin1_swedish_ci
#
# 		Use collation_name as the default server collation.
#
# --console
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--console 
# 		OS: 						Windows
#
# 		Cause the default error log destination to be the console. This affects log writers that base
# 		their own output destination on the default destination.
#
# 		Takes precedence over --log-error if both are given
#
# --core-file
# 
# 		cmd line format: 		--core-file
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		Write a core file if mysqld dies. Name and location of the core file is system dependent.
# 		On Linux, a core file named core.pid is written to the current working dir of the process, which for
# 		mysqld is the data dir.
#
# 		pid is the process ID of the server process. On macOS, a core file named core.pid is written
# 		to the /cores dir. On Solaris, use the coreadm cmd to specify where to write the core file and how to name it.
#
# 		For some systems, to get a core file you must also specify the --core-file-size option to mysqld_safe.
# 		On some systems, such as Solaris, you do not get a core file if you are also using the --user option.
# 		
# 		This may cause the need to write ulimit -c unlimited before starting the server.
#
# 		To reduce the size of core files - the innodb buffer pool in core file options can be disabled to prevent
# 		InnoDB buffer pool pages from being written to core files.
# 
# --daemonize, -D
# 		
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--daemonize[={OFF|ON}]
# 		Type 							Boolean
# 		Default: 					OFF
#
# 		Causes the server to run as a traditional, forking daemon, permitting it to work with OS systems that use
# 		systemd for process control.
#
# 		Mutually exclusive with --initialize and --initialize-secure
#
# 		If the server is started using the --daemonize option and is not connected to a tty device - a default log error option
# 		of --log-error="" is used in absence of explicit log file, to direct the error output to the default log file.
#
# 		-D is shorthand for this command.
#
# --datadir=<dir name>, -h <dir_name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--datadir=<dir_name>
# 		System var: 			datadir
# 		Scope:					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR hint 			No
# 		Type: 					Dir name
#
# 		Path to the MySQL server data dir. This option sets the datadir sys var.
#
# --debug[=<debug options>], -# [<debug_options>]
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--debug[=<debug_options>]
# 		Sys var: 				debug
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR hint 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		default (Windows): 	d:t:i:O, \mysqld.trace
# 		default (Unix): 		d:t:i:o, /tmp/mysqld.trace
#
# 		If MySQL is configured with the -DWITH_DEBUG=1 CMake option, you can use this option to get a trace
# 		file of what mysqld is doing.
#
# 		A typical <debug_options> string is d:t:o, <file_name>.
# 		
# 		Using -DWITH_DEBUG=1 to configure MySQL with debug support enables you to use the --debug="d,parser_debug" option
# 		when you start the server.
#
# 		This causes the Bison parser that is used to process SQL statements to dump a parser trace to the server's STD error output.
# 		Typically, this output is written to the error log.
#
# 		Stacks. Values that begin with + or - are subtracted from the previous value. For example:
# 		--debug=T --debug=+P sets the value to P:T
#
# --debug-sync-timeout[=N]
# 		
# 		cmd line format: 			--debug-sync-timeout[=#]
# 		Type: 						Integer
#
# 		Controls whether the Debug Sync facility for testing and debugging is enabled. Use of Debug Sync
# 		requires that MySQL be configured with the -DENABLE_DEBUG_SYNC=1 CMake option.
#
# 		If not compiled-in, this option is not available. The option value is timeout in seconds.
# 		Defaults to 0, which disables Debug Sync.
#
# 		To enable it, specify a value greater than 0; this value also becomes the default timeout for
# 		individual synchronization points.
#
# 		If the option is given without a value - the timeout is set to 300 seconds.
#
# --default-storage-engine=<type>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--default-storage-engine=name
# 		System var: 				default_storage_engine
# 		Scope: 						Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Enumeration
# 		Defaults to: 				InnoDB
#
# 		Set the default storage engine for tables. Sets the storage engine for permanent tables only.
# 		To set for temp tables - set the default_tmp_storage_engine sys Var.
#
# 		If you disable the default storage engine at server startup, you must set the default engine for both
# 		permanent and temp tables to a different engine or the server won't start
#
# --default-time-zone=<timezone>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--default-time-zone=name
# 		Type: 						String
#
# 		Set the default server time zone. This option sets the global time zone Sys var.
# 		If not given, defaults to sys time zone - same as sys time zone sys var
#
# --defaults-extra-file=<file name>
#
# 		Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix) before the user option file.
# 		If the file does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.
# 		Relative if relative, Absolute if Absolute.
#
# 		Must be the first option given if used on the cmd line.
#
# --defaults-file=<file name>
# 
#		Read only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.
# 		Relative if relative, absolute if absolute.
#
# 		Still reads mysqld-auto.cnf
#
# 		Must be first option on cmd, except if server is started with --defaults-file and --install (or --install-manual) options.
# 		(Then --install/--install-manual must be first)
#
# --defaults-group-suffix=<str>
#
# 		Read not only the usual option groups - but also the groups with usual names and suffix of <str>.
# 		Regex onm suffix of groups to read.
#
# --delay-key-write[={OFF|ON|ALL}]
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--delay-key-write[=name]
# 		Sys var: 				delay_key_write
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Enumeration
# 		Default: 				ON
# 		ACCEPTS: 				ON/OFF/ALL
#
# 		Specify how to use delayed key writes. Delayed key writing causes key buffers not to be flushed between
# 		writes for MyISAM tables.
#
# 		OFF disables delayed key writes.
# 		ON enables delayed key writes for those tables that were created with the DELAY_KEY_WRITE option.
# 		ALL delay key writes for all MyISAM tables.
#
# 		NOTE: If set to ALL, one should not use MyISAM tables from within another program (such as another MySQL server or
# 				myisamchk) when the tables are in use. Causes index corruption if you do.
#
# --des-key-file=<file name>
#
# 	 	cmd line format: 		--des-key-file=<file_name>
# 		Deprecated: 			Yes
#
# --early-plugin-load=<plugin list>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--early-plugin-load=<plugin_list>
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Defaults: 				Empty string
#
# 		This option tells the server which plugins to load before loading mandatory built-in plugins and before storage engine initialization.
# 		If multiple --early-plugin-load options are given, only the last one is used.
#
# 		The option value is a semicolon-separated list of <name>=<plugin_library> and <plugin_library> values.
#
# 		Each <name> is the name of a plugin to load, and <plugin_library> is the name of the library file that contains the plugin code.
# 		If a plugin library is named without any preceding plugin name - the server loads all plugins in the library.
#
# 		The server looks for plugin lib files in the dir named by the <plugin dir> Sys var.
#
# 		For example, if plugins named myplug1 and myplug2 have lib files myplug1.so and myplug2.so, use this option to perform an early plugin load:
#
# 			mysqld --early-plugin-load="myplug1=myplug1.so;myplug2=myplug2.so"
#
# 		Quotes are used around the arg value because otherwise a ; is treated as command eliminator in terms of for instance Unix systems.
#
# 		Each named plugin is loaded early for a single invocation of mysqld only.
# 		After a restart, the plugin is not loaded early unless --early-plugin-load is used again.
#
# 		If the server uses --initialize or --initialize-secure, plugins specified by --early-plugin-load are not loaded.
#
# 		If the server is run with --help, plugins specified by --early-plugin-load are loaded but not initialized. Ensures that
# 		plugin options are displayed in the help messages.
#
# 		Default of --early-plugin-load value is empty. To load the keyring_file plugin, you must use an explicit --early-plugin-load option with
# 		a nonempty value.
#
# 		The InnoDB tablespace encryption feature relies on the keyring_file plugin for encryption key management,
# 		and the keyring_file plugin must be loaded prior to storage engine initialization to facilitate InnoDB recovery for encrypted tables.
#
# 		Admins who want the keyring_file plugin loaded at startup should use the appropiate nonempty option value.
# 		For example - keyring_file.so on Unix and keyring_file.dll on Windows.
#
# --enable-named-pipe
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--enable-named-pipe
# 		Platform specific: 		Windows
#
# 		Enable support for named pipes. Applies only on Windows.
#
# --event-scheduler[=<value>]
# 		
# 		cmd line format: 			--event-scheduler[=<value>]
# 		Sys var: 					event_scheduler
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Enumeration
# 		Default (>= 8.0.3) 		On
# 		Default (<= 8.0.2) 		OFF
# 		Valid: 						ON/OFF/DISABLED
#
# 		For more info on this, see --event-scheduler.
# 		Enable, disable - start or stop the event scheduler.
#
# --exit-info[=<flags>], -T [<flags>]
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--exit-info[=<flags>]
# 		Type: 						Integer
#
# 		This is a bitmask of different flags that you can use for debugging the mysqld server.
# 		
# --external-locking
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--external-locking
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Defaults: 					FALSE
#
# 		Enable external locking (system locking), which is disabled by default.
#
# 		If you use this option on a system on which lockd does not fully work (such as Linux),
# 		mysqld can easily deadlock.
#
# 		To disable external locking explicitly, use --skip-external-locking.
#
# 		External locking affects only MyISAM table access. 
#
# --flush
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--flush
# 		Sys Var 						flush
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Defaults: 					OFF
#
# 		Flush (synchronize) all changes to disk after each SQL statement. 
#
# 		Normally, MySQL does a write of all changes to disk only after each SQL statement
# 		and lets the OS handle the synch to disk.
#
# 		Note: If activated, flush time is ignored.
#
# --gdb 
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--gdb
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		default: 					FALSE
#
# 		Install an interrupt handler for SIGINT (needed to stop mysqld with ^C to set breakpoints) and disable stack tracking
# 		and core file handling.
#
# 		On Windows, this option also suppresses the forking that is used to implement the RESTART statement:
#
# 			Forking enables one process to act as a monitor to the other, which acts as the server.
#
# 			However, forking makes determining the server process to attach to for debugging more difficult,
# 			so starting the server with --gdb suppresses forking.
# 
# 			For a server started with this, RESTART simply exits and does not restart.
#
# 			In non-debug settings, --no-monitor may be used to suppress forking the monitor process.
#
# --general-log[={0|1}]
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--general-log
# 		Sys var: 					general_log
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Defaults: 					OFF
#
# 		Specify the initial general query log state. With no argument or an argument of 1, the --general-log option enables the log.
# 		If omitted or given with an arg of 0 - the option disables the log.
#
# --initialize, -I
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--initialize
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Defaults: 					OFF
#
# 		Initializes a mysql installation by creating the data dir and populating the tables in the mysql system DB.
# 		
# 		When the server is started with --initialize, some functionality is unavailable that limits the statements permitted
# 		in any file named by the --init-file option.
#
# 		In addition, disabled_storage_engine sys var has no effect.
#
# 		--initialize is mutually exclusive with --daemonize 
#
# 		-I is a synonym for --initialize
#
# --initialize-insecure
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--initialize-insecure
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Default: 					OFF
#
# 		This option is used to initialize a MySQL installation by creating the data dir and populating the tables
# 		in the mysql system DB. This option implies --initialize.
#
# 		--initialize-insecure is mutually exclusive with --daemonize.
#
# --init-file=<file name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--init-file=file_name
# 		Sys var: 					init_file
# 		Scope: 						Global 
# 		Dynamic: 					No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						File name
#
# 		Read the SQL statements from this file at the startup. Each statement must be on a single line and should not include comments.
#
# 		If the server is started with the --initialize or --initialize-insecure option, it operates in bootstrap mode and some
# 		functionality is unavailable that limits the statements permitted in the file.
#
# 		These include statements that are related to account management (such as CREATE USER or GRANT), replication and global transaction identifiers.
#
# --innodb-<xxx>
#
# 		Set an option for the InnoDB storage engine. The InnoDB options are listed later.
#
# --install [<service name>]
# 
# 		cmd line format: 			--install [service_name]
# 		Platform: 					Windows
#
# 		Install the server as a Windows Service that starts automatically when Windows does as well.
# 		Defaults to MySQL if no Service_name value is given.
#
# 		If server is started with --defaults-file and --install, --install must be first.
#
# --install-manual [<service name>]
# 		
# 		cmd line format: 			--install-manual [<service_name>]
# 		Platform: 					Windows
#
# 		Install the server as a Windows service that must be started manually. Does not start automatically during Windows boot cycle.
# 		Default service name is MySQL if no service_name is given.
#
# 		--install-manual first if --defaults-file and --install-manual given.
#
# --language=<lang name>, -L <lang name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--language=name
# 		Deprecated: 				Yes; use lc-messages-dir
# 		Sys Var: 					language
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Dir name
# 		Default value: 			/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/english/
#
# 		The language to use for error messages. <lang_name> can be given as the language name or as the full path name to the dir
# 		where the language files are installed.
#
# 		--lc-messages-dir and --lc-messages should be used rather than --language, which is deprecated (and handeled as an alias for --lc-messages-dir).
# 		--language will be removed in a future MySQL release.
#
# --large-pages
# 
# 		cmd line format: 			--large-pages
# 		Sys var: 					large_pages
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					No
# 		SET_VAR hint: 				No
# 		Platform specific: 		Linux
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Default: 					FALSE
#
# 		Some hardware/OS architechtures support memory pages greater than the default (4kb normally)
# 		The actual implementation of this support depends on the underlying hardware and OS.
#
# 		Applications that perform a lot of memory accesses may obtain performance improvements by using
# 		large pages due to reduced Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) Misses.
#
# 		Disabled by default.
#
# 		MySQL supports the Linux implementation of large page support (which is called HugeTLB) in Linux.
#
# 		For solaris, this pertains to --super-large-pages.
#
# --lc-messages=<locale name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--lc-messages=name
# 		Sys var: 					lc_messages
# 		Scope: 						Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						String
# 		Default: 					en_US
#
# 		The locale to use for error messages. Defaults to en_US. The server converts
# 		the args to a language name and combines it with the value of --lc-messages-dir to produce the location
# 		for the error message file.
#
# --lc-messages-dir=<dir name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--lc-messages-dir=dir_name
# 		Sys var: 					lc_messages_dir
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Dir name
#
# 		The dir where error messages are located. The server uses the value together with the value
# 		of --lc-messages to produce the location for the error message file.
#
# --local-service
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--local-service
# 		
# 		Windows based: A --local-service option following the service name causes the server to run using the
# 							LocalService Windows acc that has limited sys privs.
#
# 							If both --defaults-file and --local-service are given following the service name, they can be in any order.
#
# --log-error[=<file name>]
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--log-error[=file_name]
# 		Sys var: 					log_error
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						File name
#
# 		Set the default error log dest. to the named file. This affects log writers that base their own
# 		output dest on the default dest.
#
# 		If the option names no file, the default error log dest on Unix and Unix-like systems is a file named <host_name.err> in the data Dir.
# 		The default destination on Windows is the same, unless the --pid-file option is specified.
#
# 		In that case, the file name is the PID file base name with a suffix of .err in the data dir.
#
# 		If the option names a file, the default destination is that file (with an .err suffix added if the name has no suffix),
# 		located under the data dir unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different location.
#
# 		If error log output cannot be redirected to the error log file, an error occurs and startup fails.
#
# 		On Windows, --console takes precedence over --log-error if both are given. In this case, the default error log destination is
# 		the console rather than a file.
#
# --log-isam[=<file name>]
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-isam[=file_name]
# 		Type: 					File name
#
# 		Log all MyISAM changes to this file (used only when debugging MyISAM)
#
# --log-output=<value>, ...
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-output=name
# 		Sys var: 				log_output
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Set
# 		Defaults: 				FILE
# 		Valid: 					TABLE, FILE, NONE
#
# 		This option determines the destination for general query log and slow query log output.
# 		The option value can be given as one or more of the words TABLE, FILE or NONE.
#
# 		TABLE select logging to the general log and slow_log tables in the mysql database as a destination.
# 		FILE selects logging to log files as a destination.
# 		NONE disables logging.
#
# 		If NONE is present in the option value, it takes precedence over any other words that are present.
# 		TABLE and FILE can both be given to select to both log output destinations.
#
# 		This option selects log output destinations, but does not enable log output.
# 		To do that, use the --general_log and --slow_query_log options.
#
# 		For FILE logging, the --general_log_file and -slow_query_log_file options determine the log file location.
#
# --log-queries-not-using-indexes
# 
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-queries-not-using-indexes
# 		System variable: 		log_queries_not_using_indexes
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		If you are using this option with the slow query log enabled, queries that are expected to retrieve all rows are logged.
#
# 		This option does not necessarily mean that no index is used. For example - a query that uses a full index scan uses an index
# 		but would be logged because the index would not limit the number of rows.
#
# --log-raw 
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-raw[=<value>]
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		Passwords in certain statements written to the general query log, slow query log and binary log are rewritten by the server
# 		not to occur literally in plain text.
#
# 		Password rewriting can be suppressed for the general query log by starting the server with the --log-raw option.
# 		This option may be useful for diagnostic purposes, to see the exact text of statements as received by the server,
# 		but for security reasons is not recommended for production use.
#
# 		If a query rewrite plugin is installed, the --log-raw option affects statement logging as follows:
#
# 			Without --log-raw, the server logs the statement returned by the query rewrite plugin. This may differ from the statement as received.
#
# 			With --log-raw, the server logs the original statement as received.
#
# --log-short-format
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-short-format
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				FALSE
#
# 		Log less information to the slow query log, if it has been activated.
#
# --log-tc=<file name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-tc=file_name
# 		Type: 					File name
# 		Default: 				tc.log
#
# 		The name of the memory-mapped transaction coordinator log file (for XA transactions that affect multiple storage engines
# 		when the binary log is disabled).
#
# 		The default name is tc.log. The file is created under the data dir if not given as a full path name. Unused.
#
# --log-tc-size=<size>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-tc-size=#
# 		Type: 					integer
# 		Default: 				6 * page * size
# 		Minimum value: 		6 * page * size
# 		Max (64-bit) 			<a lot>
# 		Max (32-bit) 			<less>
#
# 		The size in bytes of the memory-mapped transaction coordinator log. 
# 		Defaul and min values are 6 times the page size, and the value must be a multiple of the page size.
#
# --log-warnings[=<level>], -W [<level>]
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--log-warnings[=#]
# 		Deprecated: 			YES (removed in 8.0.3)
#     Sys var: 				log_warnings
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Int
# 		Default value: 		2
# 		Min val: 				0
# 		Max (64-bit) 			<a lot>
# 		Max (32-bit) 			<a lot>
#
# 		DEPRECATED - Use log error verbosity sys var instead.
#
# --low-priority-updates
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--low-priority-updates
# 		Sys var: 				low_priority_updates
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				FALSE
#
# 		Give table-modifying operations (INSERT, REPLACE, DELETE, UPDATE) lower prio than selects..
# 		This can also be done using { INSERT | REPLACE | DELETE | UPDATE } LOW PRIORITY ... to lower the prio of only one query,
# 		or by SET LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1 to change the priority in one thread.
#
# 		This affects only storage engines that use only table-level locking (MyISAM, MEMORY, MERGE)
#
# --min-examined-row-limit=<number>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--min-examined-row-limit=#
# 		Sys var: 				min_examined_row_limit
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				0
# 		Min value: 				0
# 		Max (64-bit) 			<a lot>
# 		Max (32-bit) 			<less>
#
# 		When this option is set - queries which examine fewer than <number> rows are not written to the slow query log. Default is 0.
#
# --memlock
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--memlock
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				FALSE
#
# 		Lock the mysqld process in memory. This option might help if you have a problem where the OS is causing mysqld to swap to disk.
#
# 		--memlock works on systems that support the mlockall() system call; this includes Solaris, most Linux distributions that use a 2.4 or higher kernel,
# 		and perhaps other Unix systems.
#
# 		On Linux systems, you can tell whether or not mlockall() (and thus this option) is supported by checking to see whether or not it is defined
# 		in the system mman.h file, as follows:
#
# 		grep mlockall /usr/include/sys/mman.h
#
# 		If mlockall() is supported, you should see in the output of the previous command something as follows:
#
# 		extern int mlockall (int __flags) __THROW;
#
# 		NOTE: Do not use on a system that does not support mlockall(). Will crash, if you do.
#
# 		Might need to run as root, but can be circumvented with limits.conf changing as well.
#
# --myisam-block-size=<N>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--myisam-block-size=#
# 		Type: 					integer
# 		Default: 				1024
# 		Min value: 				1024
# 		Max value: 				16384
#
# 		Block size used for MyISAM index pages.
#
# --myisam-recover-options[=<option>[, <option>] ...]]
# 	
# 		cmd line format: 		--myisam-recover-options[=<name>]
# 		Type: 					Enumeration
# 		Default: 				Off
# 		Valid values: 			OFF/DEFAULT/BACKUP/FORCE/QUICK
#
# 		Set the MyISAM storage engine recovery mode. The option value is any combination of the values of
# 		OFF, DEFAULT, BACKUP, FORCE or QUICK.
#
# 		If you specify multiple values, separate them by commas. Specifying the option with no argument is the same
# 		as specifying DEFAULT, and specifying with an explicit value of "" disables recovery (same as OFF).
#
# 		If recovery is enabled, each time mysqld opens a MyISAM table, it checks whether the table is marked as crashed
# 		or was not closed properly. (The last option works only if you are running with external locking disabled).
#
# 		If this is the case, mysqld runs a check on the table. If the table was corrupted, mysqld attempts to repair it.
#
# 		The following options pertain to how the repair works:
#
# 		OFF 		No recovery
# 		DEFAULT 	Recovery without backup, forcing or quick checking
# 		BACKUP 	If hte data file was changed during recovery, save a backup of the <tbl_name>.MYD file as <tbl_name-datetime>.BAK
# 		FORCE 	Run recovery even if we would lose more than one row from the .MYD file
# 		QUICK 	Do not check the rows in the table if there are not any delete blocks.
#
# 		Before the server automatically repairs a table, it writes a note about the repair to the error log.
#
# 		If you want to be able to recover from most problems without user intervention - you should use the options
# 		BACKUP, FORCE. This forces a repair of a table even if some rows would be deleted, but it keeps the old data file
# 		as a backup so that you can later examine what occured.
#
#
# --no-defaults
#
# 		Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to reading unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults
# 		prevents crashing in relation to reading.
#
# --no-dd-upgrade
#
# 		cmd line format: 				--no-dd-upgrade
# 		Introduced: 					8.0.4
# 		Type: 							Boolean
# 		Default: 						FALSE
#
# 		Prevents the automatic upgrade of data dictionary tables when starting the MySQL server. This option would typically be used
# 		when starting the MySQL server following an in-place upgrade of the MySQL server to a new version, which may include changes to
# 		data dictionary table defs.
#
# 		When --no-dd-upgrade is specified, and the server finds that the data dictionary version of the server is different from the 
# 		version stored in the data dictionary, startup fails with an error stating that data dictionary upgrade is prohibited.
#
# 		During a normal startup, the data dictionary version of the server is compared to the version stored in the data dictionary
# 		to determine if data dictionary table defs should be upgraded.
#
# 		If an upgrade is necessary and supported, the server creates data dictionary tables with updated definitions, copies persisted
# 		metadata to the new tables, automatically replaces the old tables with new ones, and reinitializes the data dir.
#
# 		If an upgrade is not necessary, startup continues without updating data dir tables.
#
# --no-monitor
#
# 	   cmd line format: 				--no-monitor
# 		Introduced: 					8.0.12
# 		Platform based: 				Windows
# 		Type: 							Boolean
# 		Default: 						FALSE
#
# 		Suppresses the forking that is used to implement the RESTART statement.
# 		Forking enables one process to act as a monitor to the other, which acts as the server.
#
# 		For a server started with this option, RESTART simply exits and does not restart.
#
# 		Case of < 8.0.12 - can use --gdb for workaround.
#
# --old-alter-table
#
# 		cmd line format: 				--old-alter-table
# 		Sys Var: 						old_alter_table
# 		Scope: 							Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 						Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 					No
# 		Type: 							Boolean
# 		Default: 						OFF
#
# 		When this option is given, the server does not use the optimized method of processing an ALTER TABLE operation.
# 		It reverts to using a temp table, copying over the data - and then renames the temp table to the original - as per MySQL <= 5.0
#
# --old-style-user-limits
#
# 		cmd line format: 				--old-style-user-limits
# 		Type: 							Boolean
# 		Default: 						FALSE
#
# 		Enable old-style user limits. (Causes account resource limits to be counted seperately for each host from which a user connected rather than per acc row in the user table)
#
# --open-files-limit=<count>
#
# 		cmd line format: 				--open-files-limit=#
# 		Sys Var: 						open_files_limit
# 		Scope: 							Global
# 		Dynamic: 						No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 					No
# 		Type: 							Int
# 		Default: 						5000, can be adjusted
# 		min: 								0
# 		max: 								OS dependant
#
# 		Changes the number of file descriptors available to mysqld. You should try increasing the value of this option if
# 		mysqld gives you the error "Too many open files".
#
# 		mysqld uses the option value to reserve desc with setrlimit().
# 		Internally, the maximum value for this option is the max unsigned integer value,
# 		but the actual max is OS dependant.
#
# 		If the requested number of file desc cannot be allocated, mysqld writes a warning to the error log.
#
# 		mysqld may attempt to allocate more than the requested number of desc (if they are available) using the values of max_connections
# 		and table_open_cache to estimate whether more descriptors will be needed.
#
# 		On Unix, the value cannot be set greater than ulimit -n
#
# --performance-schema-xxx
# 
# 		Configure a Performance Schema Option.
#
# --pid-file=<file name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 	--pid-file=<file_name>
# 		Sys Var: 			pid_file
# 		Scope: 				Global
# 		Dynamic: 			No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 		No
# 		Type: 				File name
#
# 		Path name of the process ID file. The server creates the file in teh data dir unless an absolute path name is given to specify
# 		a different dir.
#
# 		If specified - must specify a value.
#
# 		If not specified, defaults to <host_name>.pid - where host name is name of the host machine.
#
# 		The process ID file is used by other programs such as mysqld_safe to determine the servers process ID.
# 		On Windows, this variable also affects the default error log file name.
#
# --plugin-xxx
#
# 		Specifies an option that pertains to a server plugin. 
#
# 		For example, many storage engines can be built as plugins, and for such engines, options for them
# 		can be specified with a --plugin prefix.
#
# 		Thus, the --innodb_file_per_table option for InnoDB can be specified as --plugin-innodb_file_per_table
#
# 		For boolean options, that can be enabled or disabled, the --skip prefix and other alternatives are supported.
#
# 		For example - --skip-plugin-innodb_file_per_table disables innodb_file_per_table.
#
# 		The rationale for the --plugin prefix is that it enables plugin options to be specified unambiguously if there is a 
# 		name conflict with a built-in server option.
#
# 		For example, if named --sql-mode - it would conflict with built in systems. To circumvent, specify with --plugin first.
#
# --plugin-load=<plugin list>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--plugin-load=<plugin_list>
# 		Type: 						String
#
# 		This option tells the server to load the named plugins at startup.
#
# 		If multiple --plugin-load options are given, only last one is used. Additional may be loaded using --plugin-load-add.
#
# 		The option value is a semicolon listed of <name>=<plugin_library> and <plugin_library> values.
#
# 		Each <name> is the name of a plugin to load - and <plugin_library> is the name of the library file that contains 
# 		the plugin code.
#
# 		If a plugin library is named without any preceding plugin name, the server loads all plugins in the library.
# 		The server looks for plugin lib files in the dir named by the <plugin dir> sys var.
#
# 		For example - if plugins named myplug1 and myplug2 have lib files - myplug1.so and myplug2.so, use this to perform an early plugin load:
#
# 		mysqld --plugin-load="myplug1=myplug1.so;myplug2=myplug2.so"
#
# 		This differs from INSTALL PLUGIN in that it's localized to one invocation of mysqld - Which adds one entry to the mysql.plugins table to cause
# 		the plugin to be loaded for every normal server startup.
#
# 		Under normal startup, the server determines which plugins to load by reading the mysql.plguins system table.
#
# 		If the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option - it does not consult the mysql.plugins table and does not load plugins
# 		listed there.
#
# 		--plugin-load allows for plugins to be loaded even when --skip-grant-tables is given.
# 		--plugin-load also enables plugins to be loaded at startup that cannot be loaded at runtime.
#
# --plugin-load-add=<plugin list>
#
# 		cmd line format: 			--plugin-load-add=plugin_list
# 		Type: 						String
#
# 		This option complements the --plugin-load option. 
# 		--plugin-load-add adds a plugin or plugins to the set of plugins to be loaded at startup.
#
# 		The argument format is the same as for --plugin-load. --plugin-load-add can be used to avoid specifying a large
# 		set of plugins as a single long unwieldy --plugin-load argument.
#
# 		--plugin-load-add can be used instead of --plugin-load, but any ones that precedes --plugin-load, resets the set to load.
#
# 		i.e: 	--plugin-load=x --plugin-load-add=y   		--> 		--plugin-load="x;y"
#
# 				--plugin-load-add=y 	--plugin-load=x 		--> 		--plugin-load=x
#
# --port=<port_num>, -P <port_num>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--port=#
# 		Sys var: 				port
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				3306
# 		Min value: 				0
# 		Max value: 				65535
#
# 		Port number to use for listening on to TCP/IP connections. On Unix/akin, >= 1024 if not started by root
#
# --port-open-timeout=<num>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--port-open-timeout=#
# 		Type: 					int
# 		Default: 				0
#
# 		On some systems, when the server is stopped, the TCP/IP port might not become available immediately.
# 		If the server is restarted quickly afterwards, its attempt to reopen the port can fail.
#
# 		This indicates how many seconds the server should wait for the TCP/IP port to become free if it cannot be opened.
# 		Defaults to not wait.
#
# --print-defaults
#
# 		Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files.
# 		PWs are masked. Must be first - except in relaiton to --defaults-file or --defaults-extra-file.
#
# --remove [<service_name>]
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--remove [service_name]
# 		platform: 				Windows
#
# 		Removes a MySQL Windows service. Default service name is MySQL if no <service_name> value is given.
#
# --safe-user-create
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--safe-user-create
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				FALSE
#
# 		If this option is enabled, a user cannot create new MySQL users by using the GRANT statement unless the user has the INSERT privs
# 		for the mysql.user table or any column in the table.
#
# 		If you want a user to have the ability to create new users that have those privs that the user has the right to grant,
# 		grant the user the following privs:
#
# 		GRANT INSERT(user) 	ON mysql.user 	TO 'user_name'@'host_name';
#
# 		Ensures that the user cannot change any priv columns directly - but has to use the GRANT statement to give privs to other users.
#
# --secure-auth
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--secure-auth
# 		DEPRECATED: 			8.0.3
# 		Sys var: 				secure_auth
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					BOOLEAN
# 		Default: 				ON
# 		VALID: 					ON
#
# --secure-file-priv=<dir name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--secure-file-priv=dir_name
# 		Sys var: 				secure_file_priv
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				platform specific
# 		Valid: 					empty string, dirname, NULL
#
# 		Sets the secure file priv sys var - which is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations,
# 		such as those performed by the LOAD DATA and SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statements and the LOAD FILE() function.
#
# --shared-memory
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--shared-memory[={0,1}]
# 		Sys var: 				shared_memory
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Platform: 				Windows
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				FALSE
#
# 		Enables shared-memory connections by local clients. Can only be done on Windows.
#
# --shared-memory-base-name=<name>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--shared-memory-base-name=name
# 		System var: 			shared_memory_base_name
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Platform: 				Windows
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				MYSQL
#
# 		Name of the shared memory to use for shared-memory connections. Case sensitive.
#
# --skip-concurrent-insert
#
# 		Turns off the ability to select and insert at the same time on MyISAM tables. 
#
# --skip-event-scheduler
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--skip-event-scheduler
# 									--disable-event-scheduler
#
# 		Turns the Event Scheduler OFF. Not the same as disabling the event scheduler - that would require --event-scheduler=DISABLED;
#
# --skip-grant-tables
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--skip-grant-tables
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				FALSE
#
# 		Causes the server to start without using the privilege system at all, which gives
# 		anyone with access to the server unrestricted access to all DBs.
#
# 		Can cause a running server to start using the grant tables again by executing mysqladmin flush-privileges
# 		or mysqladmin reload cmd from a sys shell or by issuing a MySQL FLUSH PRIVILEGES statement after connecting to the server.
#
# 		If the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option to disable authentication checks, the server enables
# 		--skip-networking automatically to prevent remote connections.
#
# 		Also causes the server to suppress during its startup sequence the loading of user-defined functions (UDFs),
# 		scheduled events and plugins that were installed with the INSTALL PLUGIN statement.
#
# 		To cause plugins to be loaded anyway, use the --plugin-load option: --skip-grant-tables also causes the 
# 		disabled_storage_engines sys var to have no effect.
#
# 		Does not cause loading of server components to be suppressed during server startup.
#
# 		FLUSH PRIVILEGES might be executed implicitly by other actions performed after startup.
# 		For example, mysql_upgrade flushes the priv during the upgrade procedure.
#
# --skip-host-cache
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--skip-host-cache
#
# 		Disable use of the internal host cache for faster name-to-IP resolution.
# 		In this case, the server performs a DNS lookup every time a client connects.
#
# 		Use of --skip-host-cache is similar to setting the host_cache_size sys var to 0,
# 		but host_cache_size is more flexible - due to ability of integration of resizing, enabling or disabling,
# 		host cache at runtime, not just at server startup.
#
# 		If you start the server with --skip-host-cache - that does not prevent changes to the value of host_cache_size,
# 		but such changes have no effect and the cache is not re-enabled even if host_cache_size is set larger than 0.
#
# --skip-innodb
#
# 		Disable the InnoDB storage engine. In this case, because the default storage engine is InnoDB, the server will not
# 		start unless you also use --default-storage-engine and --default-tmp-storage-engine to set the default to some other
# 		engine for both permanent and TEMPORARY tables.
#
# 		The InnoDB storage engine cannot be disabled, and the --skip-innodb option is deprecated and has no effect.
# 		Results in a warning.
#
# --skip-name-resolve
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--skip-name-resolve
# 		Sys Var: 				skip_name_resolve
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		Do not resolve host names when checking client connections. Use only IP addresses.
# 		If used - all Host column values in the grant table must be IP addresses.
#
# 		Depending on the network configuration of your system and the Host values for your accounts,
# 		clients may need to connect using an explicit --host option - such as --host=127.0.0.1 or --host=::1
#
# 		Example: If on, 127.0.0.1 does not resolve to localhost. Must be designated with:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'root'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
# 		CREATE USER 'root'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
#
# --skip-networking
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--skip-networking
# 		Sys Var: 				skip_networking
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
#
# 		Do not listen for TCP/IP connections at all. All interactions with mysqld must be done through named pipes or shared memory or Unix sockets.
# 		Recommended for systems with only local clients permitted.
#
# 		If the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option to disable authentication checks, the server enables --skip-networking to prevent remote connections.
#
# --ssl*
#
# 		Specify whether to permit clients to connect using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys/Certs.
#
# --standalone
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--standalone
# 		Platform: 				Windows
#
# 		Instructs MySQL server to not run as a service.
#
# --super-large-pages
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--super-large-pages
# 		Platform: 				Solaris
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				FALSE
#
# 		Standard use of large pages in MySQL attempts to use the largest size supported, up to 4MB.
# 		Under Solaris, super large pages is up to 256MB of pages.
#
# 		Can be turned on/off with: --super-large-pages or --skip-super-large-pages option.
#
# --symbolic-links, --skip-symbolic-links
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--symbolic-links
# 		Deprecated: 			8.0.2
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default (8.0.2 >=) 	OFF
# 		Default (8.0.1 <=) 	ON
#
# 		Enable or disable symbolic link support. On Unix, enabling symbolic links means that you can link a MyISAM index file or
# 		data file to another dir with the INDEX DIR or DATA DIR option of the CREATE TABLE statement.
#
# 		If deleting or renaming the table - the files that its symbolic links point to also are deleted or renamed.
#
# 		Symbolic link support, --symbolic-links - is deprecated. Disabled by default. have_symlink sys var is also deprecated
# 		Does not pertain to Windows.
#
# --skip-show-database
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--skip-show-database
# 		Sys Var: 				skip_show_database
# 		Scope: 					Global
#		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
#
# 		This option sets the skip_show_database sys var that controls who is permitted to use the SHOW DATABASE.
#
# --skip-stack-trace
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--skip-stack-trace
#
# 		Do not write stack traces. Useful when running mysqld under a debugger.
# 		On some systems, you also must use this option to get a core file.
#
# --slow-query-log[={0|1}]
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--slow-query-log
# 		Sys Var: 				slow_query_log
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		Specify the initial slow query log state. With no argument or an argument of 1, the --slow-query-log
# 		option enables the log. If omitted or given 0 - disables the log.
#
# --slow-start-timeout=<timeout>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--slow-start-timeout=#
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				15000
#
# 		Controls the Windows service control manager's service start timeout.
# 		Max number of milliseconds that the service control manager waits before trying to kill the Windows service during startup.
# 		Default value is 15000 (15 seconds).
#
# 		0 is no timeout. 
#
# --socket=<path>
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--socket={file_name|pipe_name}
# 		Sys Var: 				socket
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default (Other)  		/tmp/mysql.sock
# 		Default (Windows) 	MySQL
#
# 		On Unix, specifies the Unix socket file to use when listening for local connections.
# 		The default value is /tmp/mysql.sock.
#
# 		If this option is given, the server creates the file in the data dir unless an absolute path name is given
# 		to specify a different dir.
#
# 		On Windows, the option specifies the pipe name to use when listening for local connections that used a named pipe.
# 		Default is MySQL (not case sensitive)
#

#
# --sysdate-is-now
#
# 	cmd line format: 			--sysdate-is-now
# 	Type: 						Boolean
# 	Default: 					FALSE
#
# 	SYSDATE() by default returns the time at which it executes, not the time at which the statement in which
# 	it occurs begins executing.
#
# 	This differs from the be´havior of NOW().
#
# 	Causes the SYSDATE() to be an alias for NOW().
#
# --tc-heuristic-recover={COMMIT|ROLLBACK}
#
# 	cmd line format: 			--tc-heuristic-recover=name
# 	Type: 						Enumeration
# 	Default: 					COMMIT
# 	Valid: 						COMMIT, ROLLBACK
#
# 	Type of decision to use in the heuristic recovery process. 
# 	To use this option, two or more storage engines that support XA transactions must be installed.
#
# --temp-pool
#
# 	cmd line format: 			--temp-pool
# 	Deprecated: 				Yes (Removed in 8.0.1)

# 	Scope: 						Global, Session
# 	Dynamic: 					Yes
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 	Type: 						Enumeration
# 	Default: 					REPEATABLE-READ
# 	Valid: 						READ-UNCOMMITTED
# 									READ-COMMITTED
# 									REPEATABLE-READ
# 									SERIALIZABLE
#
# 	Sets the default transaction isolation level. The <level> value can be:
# 	READ-UNCOMMITTED, READ-COMMITTED, REPEATABLE-READ or SERIALIZABLE.
#
# 	The default transaction isolation level can also be set at runtime using the SET TRANSACTION
# 	statement or by setting the transaction_isolation SYS VAR.
#
# --transaction-read-only
#
# 	cmd line format: 			--transaction-read-only
# 	Sys Var: 					transaction_read_only
# 	Scope: 						Global, Session
# 	Dynamic: 					Yes
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 	Type: 						Boolean
# 	Default: 					OFF
#
# 	Sets the default transaction access mode. By default, read-only mode is disabled, so the mode is read/write.
#
# 	To set the default transaction access mode at runtime, use the SET TRANSACTION statement or set the
# 	transaction read only SYS VAR.
#
# --tmpdir=<dir name>, -t <dir_name>
#
# 	cmd line format: 			--tmpdir=dir_name
# 	Sys Var: 					tmpdir
# 	Scope: 						Global
# 	Dynamic: 					No
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 	Type: 						Dir name
#
# 	Path of the dir to use for creating temp files. Might be useful if your default /tmp dir resides on a platform that is too small to hold temp tables.
# 	Accepts several paths that are used in round-robin typing.
#
# 	Separation char: : on Unix, ; on Windows.
#
# 	If the MySQL server is acting as a replication slave - you should not set --tmpdir to point to a dir on a memory-based file system or to a dir
# 	that is cleared when the server host restarts.
#
# 	A replication slave needs some of its temp files to survive a machine restart so that it can replicate temp tables or LOAD DATA INFILE operations.
# 	If files in the temp file dir are lost when the server restarts, replication fails.
#
# --user={<user name>|<user id>}, -u {<user_name>|<user_id>}
#
# 	cmd line format: 			--user=name
# 	Type: 						String
#
# 	Run the mysqld server as the user having the name <user_name> or the numeric user ID <user_id>.
# 	"User" here is sys acc, not MySQL users in grant tables.
#
# 	Mandatory when starting mysqld as root. Server changes its ID during its startup sequence, causing it to run
# 	as that particular user rather than as root.
#
# 	To avoid a possible security hole where a user adds a --user=root option to my.cnf file,
# 	mysqld only runs with the first --user - attempting several causes a warning.
#
# 	/etc/my.cnf and $MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf run before CMD line. Thus, put another user than root in /etc/my.cnf (found before any other)
#
# --verbose, -v - Use this option with the --help option for detailed help.
#
# --version, -V - Display version info and exit.
#
# The following pertains to Server System Variables and more coverage about their inner workings.
#
# Sys vars can be set at server startup using options on the cmd line or in an option file.
#
# Most of them can be changed dynamically at runtime using the SET statement, which enables you to modify
# operation of the server without having to stop and restart it.
#
# We can also use Sys var values in expressions.
#
# At runtime, setting a global sys var value normally requires the SYSTEM VARIABLES ADMIN or SUPER privilege.
# Setting a session sys var normally reqs no privs - can be done by any user, there are exceptions though.
#
# based on current versioning (option files, compiled in defaults): mysqld --verbose --help
#
# Based on compiled in defaults, ignoring option files: mysqld --no-defaults --verbose --help
# 
# Current values run on server can also be seen with SHOW VARIABLES or the Performance Schema sys var tables.
#
# In terms of options, 1 and 0 act as logical booleans (TRUE and FALSE, respectively)
#
# Relative paths pertain to the data dir - such as /var/mysql/data
#
# activate_all_roles_on_login
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--activate-all-roles-on-login
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.2
# 		Sys Var: 				activate_all_roles_on_login
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		Whether to enable automatic activation of all granted roles when users log in to the server:
#
# 			If activate_all_roles_on_login is enabled, the server activates all roles granted to each account at login time.
# 			This takes precedence over default roles specified with SET DEFAULT ROLE.
#
# 			If activate_all_roles_on_login is disabled, the server activates the default roles specified with SET DEFAULT ROLE, if any, at login time.
#
# 			Granted roles include those granted explicitly to the user and those named in the mandatory_roles SYS VAR.
#
# 			activate_all_roles_on_login applies only at login time, and at the beginning of execution for stored programs and views that execute
# 			in definer context.
#
# 			To change the active roles within a session, use SET_ROLE. 
#        To change the active roles for a stored program, the program body should execute SET ROLE.
#
# authentication_windows_log_level
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--authentication-windows-log-level
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 		Sys var: 				authentication_windows_log_level
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				2
# 		Min value: 				0
# 		Max value: 				4
#
# 		Available only if the authentication_windows Windows auth plugin is enabled and debugging code is enabled.
#
# 		Sets the log level for Windows auth Plugin:
#
# 		0 		No logging
# 		1 		Log only error messages
# 		2 		Log level 1 messages and warning messages
# 		3 		Log level 2 messages and information notes
# 		4 		log level 3 messages and debug messages
#
# authentication_windows_use_principal_name
# 		
# 		cmd line format: 		--authentication-windows-use-principal-name
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 		Sys Var: 				authentication_windows_use_principal_name
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				ON
#
# 		Is available only if the authentication_windows Windows auth plugin is enabled.
#
# 		A client that authenticates using the InitSecurityContext() function should provide a string identifying
# 		the service to which it connects.
#
# 		MySQL uses the principal name (UPN) of the account under which the server is running. 
# 		The UPN has the form <user_id@computer_name> and need not be registered anywhere to be used.
#
# 		The UPN is sent by the server at the beginning of authentication handshake.
#
# 		This variable controls whether the server sends the UPN in the initial challenge.
# 		By default, the variable is enabled.
#
# 		For security reasons, it can be disabled to avoid sending the server's account name to a client in clear text.
# 		If the variable is disabled, the server always sends a 0x00 byte in the first challenge, the client does not
# 		specify <targetName>, and as a result - NTLM authentication is used.
#
# 		If the server fails to obtain its UPN (which will happen primarily in environments that do not support Kerberos authentication),
# 		the UPN is not sent by the server and NTLM authentication is used.
#
# autocommit
#
# 		cmd line format: 	--autocommit[=#]
# 		Sys Var: 			autocommit
# 		Scope: 				Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 			Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 		No
# 		Type: 				Boolean
# 		Default: 			ON
#
# 		The autocommit mode. If set to 1, all changes to a table take effect immediately. 
# 		If set to 0 - you must use COMMIT to accept a transaction or ROLLBACK to cancel it.
#
# 		If autocommit is 0 and you change it to 1, MySQL performs an automatic COMMIT of any open transaction.
# 		Another way to begin a transaction is to use a START TRANSACTION or BEGIN statement.
#
# 		By default, client connections begin with autocommit set to 1. To cause clients to begin with a default of 0,
# 		set the global autocommit value by starting the server with the --autocommit=0 option.
#
# 		Option file usage:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		autocommit=0
#
# automatic_sp_privileges
#
# 		Sys Var: 			automatic_sp_privileges
# 		Scope: 				Global
# 		Dynamic: 			Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 		No
# 		Type: 				Boolean
# 		Default: 			TRUE
#
# 		When set to 1 (Default), the server automatically grants the EXECUTE and ALTER ROUTINE privs to the
# 		creator of a stored routine - if the user cannot already execute and alter or drop the routine.
#
# 		(The ALTER ROUTINE priv is required to drop the routine). The server also automatically drops those 
# 		privs from the creator when the routine is dropped. If automatic_sp_privileges is 0, the server does
# 		not automatically add or drop these privs.
#
# 		The creator of a routine is the account used to execute the CREATE statement for it.
# 		This might not be the same as the account named as the DEFINER in the routine def.
#
# auto_generate_certs
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--auto-generate-certs[={OFF|ON}]
# 		System Var: 			auto_generate_certs
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				ON
#
# 		This variable is available if the server was compiled using OpenSSL. Controls whether 
# 		the server autogenerates SSL key and certificate files in the data dir, if they do not already exist.
#
# 		At startup, the server automatically generates server-side and client-side SSL cert and key files in the data dir
# 		if the auto_generate_certs SYS Var is enabled, no SSL options other than --ssl is on and the server-side SSL files are 
# 		missing from the data dir.
#
# 		These files enable secure client connections using SSL.
#
# 		The sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys and caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys SYS vars are related,
# 		but control autogeneration of RSA key-pair files for secure PWs using RSA over unencrypted connections.
#
# avoid_temporal_upgrade

#
# 		This variable controls whether ALTER TABLE implicitly upgrades temporal columns found to be in pre-5.6.4 format
# 		(TIME, DATETIME and TIMESTAMP columns without support for fractional seconds precision)
#
# 		Upgrading such columns require a table rebuild, which prevents any use of fast alternations that might otherwise
# 		apply to the operation to be performed.
#
# 		This variable is disabled by default - Enabling it causes ALTER TABLE not to rebuild temporal columns and thereby be able to
# 		take advantage of fast alterations.
#
# 		DEPRECATED, will be removed.

# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				-1 (autosizing)
# 		min: 						1
# 		max: 						65535
#
#		Number of oustanding connection requests MySQL can have.
# 		This comes into play when the main MySQL thread gets very many connection requests in a very short time.
# 		It takes a small gap of time for the main thread to then check the connection and start a new thread.
#
# 		The back_log indicates how many requests can be stacked during this short time before MySQL momentarily stops answering new requests.
#
# 		Only increase this if you expect a large number of connections in a short amount of time.
#
# 		Basically the size of the listen queue for incoming TCP/IP connections.
#
# 		OS has it's own limitations. Cannot be set higher than this limit.
#
# 		defaults to max connections, adjusts max permitted number of connections.

# 		Sys Var: 				big_tables
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		If set to 1 - all temp tables are stored on disk rather than in memory.
# 		This is a little slower, but the error "The table <tbl_name> is full" does not occur for SELECT operations that require
# 		a large temp table.
#
# 		Default value for a new connection is 0 (use in-memory temp tables).
# 		Normally, you should never need to set this Var.
#
# 		When in-memory internal temporary tables are managed by the TempTable storage engine 
# 		(the default), and max amount of memory that can be occupied by the TempTable storage engine is exceeded,
# 		the TempTable storage engine starts storing data to temp files on Disk.
#
# 		When in-memory temporary tables are managed by the MEMORY storage engine,
# 		in-memory tables are automatically converted to disk-based tables as required.

# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				aes-128-ecb
#
# 		This controls the block encryption mode for block-based algorithms such as AES.
# 		It affects encryption for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT().
#
# 		block_encryption_mode takes a value in aes-<keylen>-<mode> format, where <keylen> is the key length
# 		in bits and <mode> is the encryption mode.
#
# 		The value is not case-sensitive. Permitted <keylen> values are 128, 192 and 256.
#
# 		Permitted encryption depend on whether MySQL was compiled using OpenSSL or wolfSSL:
#
# 			For OpenSSL, permitted <mode> values are: ECB, CBC, CFB1, CFB8, CFB128, OFB
#
# 			For wolfSSL, permitted <mode> values are: ECB, CBC
#
# 		For example - the following is 256 bits key length with AES encryption with the CBC mode:
#
# 			SET block_encryption_mode = 'aes-256-cbc';
#
# 		An error occurs for attempts to set block_encryption_mode to a value containing an unsupported key length
# 		or a mode that the SSL lib does not support.

# 		Default: 				8388608
# 		Min value: 				0
# 		Max value (64-bit) 	a lot
# 		Max value (32-bit) 	less
#
# 		MyISAM uses a special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts faster for INSERT ... SELECT, INSERT ... VALUES (...),
# 		(...), ... and LOAD DATA INFILE when adding data to nonempty tables.
#
# 		This variable limits the size of the cache tree in bytes per thread. 
# 		Setting it to 0 disables this optimization. Defaults to 8MB.
#
# 		(MySQL 8.0.14 >=) : Setting the session value of this SYS var is a restricted operation.
# 								  The session user must have privs sufficient to set restricted session vars.

# 		Sys Var: 				caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				ON
#
# 		Available if the server was compiled using OpenSSL. The server uses it to determine whether to autogenerate
# 		RSA private/public key-pair files in the data dir if they do not already exist.
#
# 		At startup, the server automatically generates RSA private/public key-pair files in the data dir if all of the following is true:
#
# 			The sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys or caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys sys var is Enabled
#
# 			No RSA options are specified
#
# 			No RSA files are in the data dir.
#
# 			The key-pair files enable secure password exchange using RSA over unencrypted connections for accounts authenticated
# 			by the sha256_password or caching_sha2_password plugin
#
# 			auto_generate_certs SYS var is related but controls autogeneration of SSL cert and key files needed for Secure connections using SSL.

# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						File Name
# 		Default: 					private_key.pem
#
# 		This variable specifies the path name of the RSA private key file for the caching_sha2_password auth plugin.
# 		If relative, it's relative to server data dir. File must be in PEM format.
#
# 		Because a private key is stored within - access should be restricted to MySQL.

# character_set_client
#
# 		Sys var: 					character_set_client
# 		Scope: 						Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						String
# 		Default (>= 8.0.1) 		utf8mb4
# 		Default (8.0.0) 			utf8
#
# 		Char set for statements that arrive from the client.
#
# 		The session value of this var is set using the char set requested by the client when the client
# 		connects to the server.
#
# 		Many clients support a --default-character-set option to enable this char set to be specified explicitly.
#
# 		The global value of the variable is used to set the session value in cases when the client-requested value is unknown
# 		or not available - or the server is configured to ignore client requests
#
# 		examples:
#
# 		The client requests a char set not known to the server. For example, a japanese-enabled client requests sjis when connecting
# 		to a server not configured with sjis support.
#
# 		The client is from a version of MySQL older than MySQL 4.1 - i.e, does not require a char set
#
# 		mysqld started with the --skip-character-set-client-handshake option - ignores client char set configs.
#
# 		Some char sets are invalid for client char sets. Trying to use them as the character_set_client value produces an error.
#
# character_set_connection
#
# 		Sys var: 				character_set_connection

# 		Default (8.0.0) 		latin1
# 		Footnote: 				Dynamic - but server should be designating this value by itself.
# 		
# 		The char set used by the default DB. The server sets this var whenever the default DB changes.
# 		If there is no default DB, the var has the same value as character_set_server.
#
# 		(8.0.14 >=) setting the session value of this system variable is a restricted operation.
# 		The session user must have privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables.
#
# 		The global character_set_database and collation_database SYS vars are deprecated, will be removed.
#
# 		Since they are deprecated - attempting to assign them causes a warning.
#
# 		The session vars is read only in the future.
#
# 		Can still access for reading purposes in relation to DB charset and collation.

# 		cmd line format: 			--character-set-filesystem=name
# 		Sys var: 					character_set_filesystem
# 		Scope: 						Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						String
# 		Default: 					binary
#
# 		The file system char set. Used to interpret string literals that refers to file names, such as 
# 		in the LOAD_DATA_INFILE and SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE statements and the LOAD_FILE() function.
#
# 		Such file names are converted from character_set_client to character_set_filesystem before the file opening
# 		attempt occurs.
#
# 		Default is binary, which means no conversion occurs. 
# 		For systems on which multibyte file names are permitted, a different value may be used.
#
# 		For example, if using UTF-8 in the system - we can set this to 'utf8mb4'
#
# 		(MySQL 8.0.14)	- This is a restricted operation - session user must have privs sufficient to set restricted session vars.
#
# character_set_results

# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		Some authentication plugins implement proxy user mapping for themselves (for example, the PAM and Windows auth plugins)
# 		Other authentication plugins do not support proxy users by default.
#
# 		Of these, some can request that the MySQL server itself map proxy users according to granted proxy privs:
#
# 		mysql_native_password_sha256_password
#
# 		If the check_proxy_users SYS Var is enabled, the server performs proxy user mapping for any authentication plugins that make
# 		such a request.
#
# 		However, it may also be necessary to enable plugin-specific system variables to take advantage of server proxy user mapping support:
#
# 			For the mysql_native_password plugin, enable mysql_native_password_proxy_users
#
# 			For the sha256_password plugin, enable sha256_password_proxy_users

# collation_connection
#
# 		Sys var: 				collation_connection
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
#
# 		The collation of the connection char set. 
#
# 		collation_connection is important for comparisons of literal strings.
#
# 		For comparisons of strings with column values, collation_connection does not matter because columns
# 		have their own collation, which has a higher collation precedence.

#
# 		The transaction completion type. This variable can take the values shown in the following:
#
# 		Name 						DESC
# 	
# 		NO_CHAIN/0  			COMMIT and ROLLBACK are unaffected. Default value.
#
# 		CHAIN/1 					COMMIT and ROLLBACK are equivalent to COMMIT AND CHAIN and ROLLBACK AND CHAIN respectively.
# 									(A new transaction starts immediately with the same isolation level as the just-terminated transaction)
#
# 		RELEASE/2 				COMMIT and ROLLBACK are equivalent to COMMIT RELEASE and ROLLBACK RELEASE, respectively.
# 									(The server disconnects after terminating the transaction)
#
# 		completion_type affects transactions that begin with START_TRANSACTION or BEGIN and end with COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

# 		Type: 					Enumeration
# 		Default: 				AUTO
# 		VALID: 					NEVER, AUTO, ALWAYS, 0, 1, 2
#
# 		If AUTO - MySQL permits INSERT and SELECT statements to run concurrently for MyISAM tables that have no free blocks in
# 		the middle of the data file.
#
# 		If you start mysqld with --skip-new, this variable is set to NEVER.
#
# 		Values:
#
# 		Name 				DESC
# 		
# 		NEVER/0 			Disables concurrent inserts
#
# 		AUTO/1 			Enables concurrent insert for MyISAM tables that do not have holes.
#
# 		ALWAYS/2 		Enables concurrent inserts for all MyISAM tables - even those that have holes.
# 							For a table with a hole - new rows are inserted at the end of the table if it is in
# 							use by another thread. 
#
# 							Otherwise - MySQL aquires a normal write lock and inserts the row into the hole.

# 		Type: 			String
#
# 		The variable is the user interface to the Debug Sync facility.
# 		Use of Debug Sync requires that MySQL be configured with the -DENABLE_DEBUG_SYNC=1 CMake option.
#
# 		If Debug Sync is not compiled in, this sys var is not available.
#
# 		The global var value is read only and indicates whether the facility is enabled.
# 		By default, Debug Sync is disabled and the value of debug_sync is OFF.
#
# 		If the server is started with --debug-sync-timeout=<N>, where <N> is a timeout value greater than 0,
# 		Debug Sync is enabled and the value of debug_sync is ON - <current signal> (the signal name)

#
# 			caching_sha2_password: Use SHA-256 passwords. (Default auth plugin rather than mysql_native_password)
#
# 		This value affects these aspects of server operations:
#
# 			Determines which authentication plugin the server assigns to new accounts created by CREATE USER and GRANT statements that 
# 			do not explicitly specify an authentication plugin.
#
# 			For an account created with the following statement, the server associates the account with the default auth plugin and assigns

#
# 		For interal use by replication. This SYS VAR is set to the default collation for the utf8mb4 char set.
#
# 		The value of the Var is replicated from a master to a slave so that the slave can correctly process data
# 		originating from a master with a different default collation for utf8mb4.
#
# 		Primarily intended to support replication from MySQL 5.7 or older master servers to MySQL 8.0 slave server,
# 		or group replication with a MySQL 5.7 primary node and one or more MySQL 8.0 secondaries.
#

#
# 		This option applies only to MyISAM tables. 
#     It can have one of the following values to affect handling of the DELAY_KEY_WRITE table option that can be used in CREATE TABLE statements.
#
# 		OFF - 	DELAY_KEY_WRITE is ignored.
# 		ON  - 	MySQL honors any DELAY_KEY_WRITE option specified in CREATE_TABLE statements. DEFAULT.
# 		ALL - 	All new opened tables are treated as if they were created with the DELAY_KEY_WRITE option on.
#
# 		If this option is on, the key buffer is not flushed for the table on every index update - but only when the table is closed.
# 		This speeds up writes on keys a lot - but if you use this feature, you should add automatic checking of all MyISAM tables by
# 		starting with --myisam-recover-options , example:
#
# 		--myisam-recover-options=BACKUP, FORCE
#
# 		If external locking is on with --external-locking, there is no protection against index corruption for tables that use
# 		delayed key writes.

#
# 		indicates which storage engines cannot be used to create tables or tablespaces.
# 		For example,to prevent new MyISAM or FEDERATED tables from being created - start with the lines as follows:
#
# 			[mysqld]
# 			disabled_storage_engines="MyISAM,FEDERATED"
#
# 		By default - disabled_storage_engines is empty (no engines disabled) - but can be defined with a comma-listed list.
# 
# 		Values included cause said values to not be able to be used to create tables or tablespaces with CREATE_TABLE or CREATE_TABLESPACE,
# 		and cannot be used with ALTER_TABLE_..._ENGINE or ALTER_TABLESPACE_..._ENGINE to change existing storage engines of tables or tablespaces.
#
# 		Doing so causes a ER_DISABLED_STORAGE_ENGINE error
#
# 		disabled_storage_engines does not restrict other DDL statements for existing tables, such as CREATE_INDEX,
# 		TRUNCATE_TABLE, ANALYZE_TABLE, DROP_TABLE or DROP_TABLESPACE.
#
# 		This permits a smooth transition so that existing tables or tablespaces that use a disabled engine can be migrated to a 
# 		permitted engine by means such as ALTER_TABLE_..._ENGINE_<permitted_engine>
#
# 		It is permitted to set the default_storage_engine or default_tmp_storage_engine SYS var to a storage engine that is disabled.
#
# 		However, it does make the database crash upon attempting to be utilized if used in tandem with this stature. (Can be used for debugging)
#
# 		disabled_storage_engines is disabled and has no effect if the server is started with any of these options:

# 		This var controls how the server handles clients with expired passwords:
#
# 			If the client indicates that it can handle expires passwords, the value of disconnect_on_expired_password
# 			is irrelevant. The server permits the client to connect but puts it in sandbox mode.
#
# 			If the client does not indicate that it can handle expires passwords, it handles it according to disconnect_on_expired_password:

# 		Type: 			Integer
# 		Default: 		200
# 		Min: 				0
# 		Max: 				<a lot>
#
# 		This variable indicates the number of equality ranges in an equality comparison condition when the optimizer
# 		should switch from using index drives to index statistics in estimating the number of qualifying rows.
#
# 		It applies to evaluation of expressions that have either of these equivalent forms, where the optimizer uses
# 		a nonunique index to look up <col_name> values:
#
# 			col_name IN(val1, ..., valN)
# 			col_name = val1 OR ... OR col_name = valN
#
# 		In both cases, the expression contains N equality ranges.
#
# 		The optimizer can make row estimates using index dives or index statistics.
#
# 		If eq_range_index_dive_limit is greater than 0, the optimizer uses existing index
# 		statistics instead of index dives if there are eq_range_index_dive_limit or more equality ranges.
#
# 		Thus, to permit use of index dives for up to <N> equality ranges, set eq_range_index_dive_limit to N + 1.
# 		To disable use of index statistics and always use index dives regardless of <N>, set this to 0.
#
# 		To update the table index stats for best estimates, use ANALYZE_TABLE.
#
# error_count
#
# 		Number of errors that resulted from the last statement that generated messages. is Read only.

# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default (>= 8.0.2) 	ON
# 		Default (<= 8.0.1) 	OFF
#
# 		This sys var determines whether the server enables certain nonstandard behaviors for default values and NULL value
# 		handling in TIMESTAMP columns.
#
# 		By default, explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is enabled, which disables the nonstandard behaviors.
# 		Disabling explicit_defaults_for_timestamp results in a warning.
#
# 		Setting this in scope of session is a restricted operation. Requires privs to allow for setting.
#
# 		If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled - the server enables the nonstandard behaviors and handles TIMESTAMP cols as follows:
#
# 			TIMESTAMP columns not explicitly declared with the NULL attribute are automatically declared with the NOT NULL attribute.
# 			Assigning such a column value of NULL is permitted and sets the column to the current timestamp.
#
# 			The first TIMESTAMP column in a table, if not explicitly declared with the NULL attribute or an explicit DEFAULT 
# 			or ON UPDATE attribute, is automatically declared with the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attributes.
#
# 			TIMESTAMP columns following the first one, if not explicitly declared with the NULL attribute or an explicit DEFAULT,
# 			are automatically declared as DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00'. For inserted rows that specify no explicit value for such
# 			a column, it defaults to the above with no warnings.
#
# 			Strict SQL mode or the NO ZERO DATE SQL mode being on - can cause invalidation of defaulting to 0000-00-00 00:00:00 may be invalid.
# 			Be aware that the TRADITIONAL SQL mode includes strict mode and NO ZERO DATE.
#
# 		The above is deprecated and will be removed.
#
# 		If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is on, the server disables the above and handles instead with:
#
# 			It is not possible to assign a TIMESTAMP column a value of NULL to set it to the current timestamp.
# 			To do such, you must use NOW() or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
#
# 			TIMESTAMP columns not explicitly declared with the NOT NULL attribute are automatically declared with the
# 			NULL attribute and permit NULL values. (i.e - Assigning it NULL, causes it to be NULL)
#
# 			TIMESTAMP columns declared with the NOT NULL attribute do not permit NULL values.
# 			For inserts that specify NULL for such a column, the result is an error, regardless of mode.
#
# 			TIMESTAMP cols explicitly declared with the NOT NULL attribute and without an explicit DEFAULT attribute
# 			are treated as having no default value. (if Strict is not on, the implicit default is '0000-00-00 00:00:00' and a Warning.
#
# 			No TIMESTAMP cols are automatically declared with the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attribs.
# 			(Must be explicitly declared)
#
# 			The first TIMESTAMP col in a table is not handled differently from TIMESTAMP cols following the first one.
#
# 		If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled at start, this warning crops up:
#
# 			[Warning] TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value is deprecated.
# 			Please use --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp server option
#
# 		NOTE: --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is deprecated as well. Will be removed.
#
# external_user
#
# 		Sys var: 		external_user
# 		Scope: 			Session
# 		Dynamic: 		No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 	No
# 		Type: 			String
#
# 		External user name used during the authentication process, as set by the plugin used to authenticate the client.
# 		With native MySQL auth or if the plugin does not set the value - this is NULL. (Relates to Poxy users)
#
# flush
#
# 		cmd line format: 	--flush
# 		Sys Var: 			flush
# 		Scope: 				Global
# 		Dynamic: 			Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 		No
# 		Type: 				Boolean
# 		Default: 			OFF
#
# 		If ON, the server flushes (synchs) all changes to disk after each SQL statement.
# 		Normally, MySQL does a write of all changes to disk only after each SQL statement
# 		and lets the OS handle the Sync to disk.
#
# 		Starts with ON if we start mysqld with --flush.
#
# 		NOTE: if enabled, flush_time does nothing, and changing it does nothing.
#
# flush_time
#
# 		cmd line format: 	--flush-time=#
# 		Sys var: 			flush_time
# 		Scope: 				Global
# 		Dynamic: 			Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 		No
# 		Type: 				Integer
# 		Default: 			0
# 		Min: 					0
#
# 		If set to a nonzero value, all tables are closed every flush_time seconds to free up resources and synch unflushed data to disk.
# 		Only use for systems with small amounts of resources.
#
# foreign_key_checks
#
# 		Sys Var: 			foreign_key_checks
# 		Scope: 				Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 			Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 		Yes
# 		Type: 				Boolean
# 		Default: 			ON
#
# 		If set to 1 (the default), foreign key constraints for InnoDB tables are checked.
# 		If set to 0, foreign key constraints are ignored, with a couple of exceptions.
#
# 		When re-creating a table that was dropped, an error is returned if the table definition
# 		does not conform to the foreign key constraints referencing the table.
#
# 		Likewise, an ALTER_TABLE operation returns an error if a foreign key definition is incorrectly formed.
#
# 		Typically, you leave this enabled during normal ops. Disabling can be used for reloading InnoDB tables
# 		in a order different from that required by their parent/child relationships.
#
# 		Setting foreign_key_checks to 0 also affects data definition statements: 
#
# 		DROP_SCHEMA drops a schema even if it contains tables that have foreign keys 
# 		that are referred to by tables outside the schema, and DROP_TABLE drops tables 
# 		that have foreign keys that are reffered by other tables.
#
# 		NOTE: Setting this to 1, does not trigger a scan of the existing table data. Therefore,
# 				rows added to the table while foreign_key_checks = 0 will not be verified for consistency.
#
# 				Dropping an index required by a foreign key constraint is not permitted, even with foreign_key_checks=0
# 				The foreign key constraint must be removed before dropping the index.

# 			Each char must be an ASCII nonalphanumeric char
#
# 			Either the first or second char must be a space.
#
# 			No duplicates are permitted except the phrase quoting operators in pos 11 and 12.
# 			These two chars are not required to be the same, but they are the only two that may be.

#
# 		By default, a list of stopwords is used (defined in storage/myisam/ft_static.c file)
#
# 		Setting this to '' disables stopword filtering.
#
# 		FULLTEXT indexes on MyISAM tables must be rebuilt after changing this var or the contents of the stopword file.

#
# have_statement_timeout
#
# 		Sys_Var: 		have_statement_timeout
# 		Scope: 			Global
# 		Dynamic: 		No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 	No

#
# 		Whether the statement execution timeout feature is available. 
# 		Can be NO if the background thread used by this feature, could not be initialized.
# 		
# have_symlink
#
# 		YES if symbolic link support is enabled, NO if not.
# 		Required on UNIX for support of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY table options.
#
# 		If the server is started with --skip-symbolic-links - this value is Disabled.

#
# host_cache_size
#
# 		Sys Var: 				host_cache_size
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				-1 (Autosizing, do not assign)
#		Min: 						0
# 		Max: 						65536
#
# 		Size of the internal host cache. Setting it to 0 disables the host cache.
#
# 		Changing the cache size at runtime implicitly causes a FLUSH HOSTS ops to clear the host cache
# 		and truncate the host_cache table.
#
# 		Defaults to 128 + 1 for a value of max_connections up to 500, plus 1 for every 20 above 500, up to 2k.
#
# 		Using --skip-host-cache is similar to setting the host_cache_size SYS_VAR to 0, but host_cache_size can be set during
# 		runtime - not just startup.
#
# 		If started with --skip-host-cache, modification attempts are simply ignored.
#
# hostname
#
# 		Sys var: 				hostname
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
#
# 		The server sets this var to the server host name at startup.
#
# identity
#
# 		Synonym for the last_insert_id var. Exists for compability with other DB systems.

# 		cmd line format: 		--init-connect=name
# 		Sys Var: 				init_connect
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
#
# 		A string to be executed by the server for each client that connects. 
# 		The string consists of one or more SQL statements, separated by ; chars.
#
# 		For example, each client session begins by default with autocommit mode enabled.
# 		For older servers (< 5.5.8) - there is no global autocommit SYS_VAR to specify that autocommit
# 		should be off by default - but can be circumvented with:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL init_connect='SET autocommit=0';
#
# 		Can also beb set on cmd or in a option file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		init_connect='SET autocommit=0'
#
# 		For users with SUPER priv or CONNECTION_ADMIN - the content of init_connect is not executed.
#
# 		(MySQL 8.0.5 >=) 	init_connect is skipped for any client with an expired PW.
#
# 		Allows for connection and changing of PW.
#
# information_schema_stats_expiry
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--information-schema-stats-expiry=value
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.3
# 		Sys Var: 				information_schema_stats_expiry
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				86400
# 		min: 						0
# 		Max: 						<a lot>
#
# 		Some of the information_schema tables that contain columns that provide table stats:
#
# 		STATISTICS.CARDINALITY
# 		TABLES.AUTO_INCREMENT
# 		TABLES.AVG_ROW_LENGTH
# 		TABLES.CHECKSUM
# 		TABLES.CHECK_TIME
# 		TABLES.CREATE_TIME
# 		TABLES.DATA_FREE
# 		TABLES.DATA_LENGTH
# 		TABLES.INDEX_LENGTH
# 		TABLES.MAX_DATA_LENGTH
# 		TABLES.TABLE_ROWS
# 		TABLES.UPDATE_TIME
#
#		Said columns represent the dynamic table metadata - information that changes as table contents change.
#
# 		By default, MySQL retrieves cached values for those columns from the mysql.index_stats and mysql.table_stats dictionary tables
# 		when the columns are queried, which is more efficient than retrieving stats directly from the storage engine.
#
# 		If cached stats are not available or have expired, MySQL retrieves the latest stats from the storage engine
# 		and caches them in the mysql.index_stats and mysql.table_stats dictionary tables.
#
# 		Subsequent queries retrieve the cachhed stats until the cached stats expire.
#
# 		The information_schema_stats_expiry session var defines the period of time before cached stats expire.
# 		The default is 24 hours (86400 secs), but the time period can be extended to as much as one year.
#
# 		To update cached values at any time for a given table, use ANALYZE TABLE.
#
# 		To always retrieve the latest directly from the storage engine and bybpass cached values, set information_schema_stats_expiry to 0.
#
# 		Querying stats columns does not store or update stats in the mysql.index_stats and mysql.table_stats dictionary tables under said circumstnaces:
#
# 			When cached stats have not expired
#
# 			When information_schema_stats_expiry is set to 0
#
# 			When the server is started in read_only, super_read_only, transaction_read_only or innodb_read_only
#
# 			When the query also fetches Performance Schema Data
#
# 		information_schema_stats_expiry is a session var, and each client session can define its own expiration value.
# 		Stats that are retrieved from the storage engine and cached by one session are available to other sessions.
#
# init_file
#
# 		Cmd line format: 		--init-file=file_name
# 		Sys Var: 				init_file
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					File name
#
# 		The name of the file specified with the --init-file option when you start the server.
#
# 		This should be a file containing SQL statements that you want the server to execute when it starts.
#
# 		Each statement must be on a single line and no comments. 
#
# innodb_xxx
#
# 		InnoDB sys vars are listed later.
#
# 		Said Vars control many aspects of storage, memory use and I/O patterns for InnoDB tables, and are called for in relation to InnoDB default storage engines.
#
# insert_id
# 
# 		The value to be used by the following INSERT or ALTER_TABLE statement when inserting an AUTO_INCREMENT value.
# 		Mainly used with the binary log.

# 		Default: 				INNODB
# 		Valid: 					MYISAM
# 									INNODB
#
# 		The storage engine for on-disk internal temp tables. Permitted values are MYISAM and INNODB (Default)
#
# 		The optimizer uses the storage engine defined by internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine for on-disk internal temporary tables.
#
# 		When using internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine=INNODB (the default), queries that generate on-disk internal temp tables that exceed
# 		InnoDB row or column limits will return Row size too large or Too many columns errors.
#
# 		The workaround is to set internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine to MYISAM.
#
# internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--internal-tmp-mem-storage-engine=#

# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			Yes
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				262144
# 		Min value: 				128
# 		Max (Other, 64-bit) 	<most>
# 		Max (Other, 32-bit) 	<less>
# 		Max (Windows) 			<less>
#
# 		The min size of the buffer that is used for plain index scans, range index scans, and joins that do not 
# 		use indexes and thus perform full table scans.
#
# 		Normally - the best way to get fast joins is to add indexes. Increase the value of join_buffer_size to get a faster
# 		full join when adding indexes is not possible.
#
# 		One join buffer is allocated for each full join between two tables. For a complex join between several tables for which 
# 		indexes are not used, multiple join buffers might be nessecary.
#
# 		Unless Batched Key Access (BKA) is used, there is no gain from setting the buffer larger than required to hold each
# 		matching row - and all joins allocate at least the min size, thus, careful with global min designation.
#
# 		It is better to have the global be small, and allow for session values that are larger - when thye perform large joins.
# 		Memory allocation time can cause large performance drops if the global size is larger than needed by most queries that use it.
#
# 		When BKA is used, the value of join_buffer_size defines how large the batch of keys is in each request to the storage engine.
# 		The larger the buffer, the more sequential access will be to the right hand table of a join operation, which can significantly 
# 		improve performance.
#
# 		Defaults to 256kb, max is 4gb-1. Larger is allowed for 64-bit (Windows throws a warning and sets to max)
#
# keep_files_on_create
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--keep-files-on-create=#
# 		Sys Var: 				keep_files_on_create
# 		Scope: 					Global ,Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		if a MyISAM table is created with no DATA DIR option, the .MYD file is created in the DB directory.
# 		By default, if MyISAM finds an existing .MYD file in this case, it overwrites it.
#
# 		The same applies to .MYI files for tables created with no INDEX DIRECTORY option.
# 		To suppress this behavior, set the keep_files_on_create var to ON(1), which causes MyISAM to not overwrite
# 		existing files and returns an error instead. 
#
# 		If a MyISAM table is created with a DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY option and an existing .MYD or .MYI file is found,
# 		MyISAM always returns an error. It will not overwrite a file in the specified dir.
#
#
# key_buffer_size
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--key-buffer-size=#
# 		Sys Var: 				key_buffer_size
# 		Scope: 					Global

# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				8388608
# 		Min value: 				8
# 		Max value(64-bit) 	OS_PER_PROCESS_LIMIT
# 		Max (32-bit) 			4294967295
#
# 		Index blocks for MyISAM tables are buffered and are shared by all threads. key_buffer_size is the size of the buffer used
# 		for index blocks. The key buffer is also known as the key cache.
#
# 		The max permissible setting for key_buffer_size is 4gb-1 on 32-bit platforms.
#
# 		Larger are allowed on 64-bit - Realistic size might be less. 
#
# 		The above is akin to a "hint" of request of setting to - value can be overwritten by underlying OS or Hardware etc.
#
# 		You can increase the value to get better index handling for all reads and multiple writes; on a System whose primary
# 		function is to run MySQL using the MyISAM storage engine, 25% of the total machine memory is fine.
#
# 		If assigned too large of a value, the underlying OS which handles file system caching for data reads will start to lag
#
# 		For even more speed when writing many rows at the same time, use LOCK_TABLES.
#
# 		You can check the performance of the key buffer by issuing a SHOW_STATUS statement and examining the Key_read_requests,
# 		Key_reads, Key_write_requests and Key_writes status.
#
# 		The Key_reads/Key_read_requests ratio should normally be less than 0.01.
#
# 		The Key_writes/Key_write_requests ratio is usually near 1 if you use mostly updates and deletes,
# 		but can be smaller in case of updating many rows at the same time or using the DELAY_KEY_WRITE table option.
#
# 		The fraction of the key buffer in use can be determined using key_buffer_size in conjunction with the Key_blocks_unused
# 		status variable and buffer block size, which is available from the key_cache_block_size Sys_var:
#
# 		- ((Key_blocks_unused * key_cache_block_size) / key_buffer_size)
#
# 		This value is an approximation because some space in the key buffer is allocated internally for admin structs.
# 		Factors that influence the amount of overhead for these structures include block size and pointer size.
#
# 		As block size increases, the percentage of the key buffer lost to overhead tends to decrease.
#
# 		larger blocks result in a smaller number of read ops (because more keys are obtained per read),
# 		but an increase in reads of keys that are not examined (if not all keys in a block are relevant to a query)
#
# 		It is possible to create Multiple MyISAM key caches. The size limit of 4gb applies to each cache individually, not as a group.

# 		If large page support is enabled, this shows the size of memory pages.
# 		Large memory pages are supported only on Linux, on other OS's - this is always 0.
#
# last_insert_id
#
# 		The values to be returned from LAST_INSERT_ID(). This is stored in the binary log when you use

# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				en_US
#
# 		The locale to use for error messages. The default is en_US. THe server converts the argument

# 		for the error message file.
#
# lc_messages_dir
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--lc-messages-dir=dir_name
# 		Sys var: 				lc_messages_dir
# 		Scope: 					global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No

# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default (>= 8.0.2) 	OFF
# 		Default (<= 8.0.1) 	oN
#
# 		This variable controls server-side LOCAL capability for LOAD_DATA statements. 
#
# 		Depending on the local_infile setting, the server refuses or permits local data loading 
# 		by clients that have LOCAL enables on the client side.
#
#		To explicitly cause the server to refuse or permit LOAD_DATA_LOCAL statements (regardless of how client programs and libs are configed at build time
# 		or runtime) - start mysqld with local_infile disabled or enabled, respectively.

# 		Min: 						1
# 		Max: 						31536000
#
# 		Specifies the timeout in seconds for attempts to aquire metadata locks. The permissible value ranges from
# 		1 to 1 year. Default is 1 year.
#
# 		This timeout applies to all statements that use metadata locks. These include DML and DDL operations on tables, views, stored
# 		procedures and stored functions, as well as LOCK_TABLES, FLUSH_TABLES_WITH_READ_LOCK and HANDLER statements.
#
# 		This timeout does not apply to implicit accesses to System tables in the mysql DB, such as grant tables modified by GRANT or REVOKE
# 		statements or table logging statements.
#
# 		This timeout does apply to Sys tables accessed directly, such as with SELECT or UPDATE.
#
# 		The timeout value applies separately for each metadata lock attempt. A given statement can require more than one lock, so it is possible
# 		for the statement to block for longer than the lock_wait_timeout value before reporting a timeout error. When lock timeout occurs, ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT
# 		is reported.
#
# 		lock_wait_timeout also defines the amount of time that a LOCK_INSTANCE_FOR_BACKUP statement waits for a lock before giving up.
#
# locked_in_memory
#
# 		sys var: 				locked_in_memory
# 		Scope: 					Global

# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					File name
#
# 		The default error log destination. If the destination is the console, the value is stderr.
# 		Otherwise, the destination is a file and the log error value is the file name.
#
# log_error_filter_rules

# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal
#
# 		The components to enable for error logging. This variable may contain a list with 0,1 or many elements.
#
# 		In the latter case, elements may be delimited by ; or (MySQL >= 8.0.12) , + SPACE.
#
# 		A given setting cannot use both ; and , +´SPACE separators.
#
# 		Components order is significant because the server executes components in the order listed.
# 		Any loadable (not built in) component named in the log_error_services value must first be installed
# 		with INSTALL_COMPONENT.
#
# log_error_suppression_list
#
# 		Cmd line format: 		--log-error-suppression-list=value
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.13
# 		Sys var: 				log_error_suppression_list
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				''
#
# 		This enables specifying which diagnostics should not be written to the error log when they occur
# 		with a severity of WARNING or INFORMATION.
#
# 		For example, if a particular type of warning occurs frequently but is not of interest (and thus may be
# 		considered undesirable "noise" in the error log) you can suppress that.
#
# 		The variable value may be empty string for no suppression, or a list of one or more comma separated values indicating
# 		the error codes to suppress.
#
# 		The numeric value of each code to be suppressed must be in a permitted range:
#
# 			1 up to (but less than) 1000: Global error codes that are shared by the server and clients
#
# 			10000 and higher: Server error codes intended to be written ot the error log (not sent to clients)
#
# 		Attempts to assign an error code not in a permitted range produces an error and the var value remains unchanged.
#
# 		Error codes may be specified in a numeric or symbolic form. A numeric code may be specified with or without the MY- prefix.
#
# 		Leading 0's in the numeric part are not significant. Examples of permitted code format:
#
# 			31
# 			00031
# 			MY-31
# 			MY-00031
# 			ER_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE
#
# 		List of error codes comes later.
#
# 		The server can generate messages for a given error code at different severities, so suppression for a message
# 		associated with an error code listed in log_error_suppression_list depends on its severity.
#
# 		Suppose that hte variable has a value of '10000, 10001, MY-10002'
#
# 		Messages for those codes are not written to the error log if generated with a SEVERITY of WARNING or INFORMATION.
#
# 		Messages generated with a severity of ERROR or SYSTEM are not suppressed and are written to the error log.
#
# 		The effect of log_error_suppression_list combines with that of log_error_verbosity.
#
# 		Consider a server started with these settings:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		log_error_verbosity=2 			# error and warning messages only
# 		log_error_suppression_list='10000,10001,MY-10002'
#
# 		In this case, log_error_verbosity discards all messages with INFORMATION severity.
#
# 		Of the remaining messages, log_error_suppression_list discards messages with WARNING severityy
# 		and any of the named error codes.
#
#
# 		NOTE: log_error_verbosity defaults to 2, so its effect on suppression of all INFORMATION messages is by
# 		default as above. You must set it to 3, if you want log_error_suppression_list to affect messages with INFORMATION severity.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 		[mysqld]
#		log_error_verbosity=1 #Error messages only
#
# 		Discards all messages with WARNING and INFORMATION severity.
#
# 		Setting log_error_suppression_list has no effect because all error codes it might suppress
# 		are already discarded due to the log_error_verbosity setting. 	
#
# 		log_error_suppression_list (like log_error_verbosity) affects the log_filter_internal error log filter,
# 		which is on by default.
#
# 		If that filter is turned off, error code suppression does not occur and must be modeled using whatever
# 		filter service is used instead where desired (for example, with individual filter rules when using
# 		log_filter_dragnet).

# 		The following is the verbosity levels:
#
# 		Error messages: 		1
# 		Error and Warnings: 	2
# 		Error, Warning,Info: 3
#
# 		Selected important sys messages about non-error situations are printed to the error log regardless

# 		Min: 						0
# 		Max: 						2
#
# 		If set to 0, table names are stored as specified and comparisons are case-sensitive.
#
# 		If set to 1, table names are stored in lowercase on disk and comparisons are not case sensitive.
#
# 		If set to 2, table names are stored as given but compared in lowercase.
#
# 		This option also applies to DB names and table aliases. 
#
# 		On Windows the default is 1. On macOS, default is 2. On Linux, 2 is not supported - enforced 0.
#
# 		You should NOT set lower_case_table_names to 0 if you are running MySQL on a system where the data dir
# 		resides on a case-insensitive file system (such as on Windows or macOS).
#
# 		Is an unsupported combination that could result in a hang condition when running an INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... FROM <tbl_name>
# 		operation with the wrong <tbl_name> letter case.
#
# 		With MyISAM - accessing table names using different letter cases could cause index corruption.
#
# 		An error message is printed and the server exits if you attempt to start the server with --lower_case_table_names=0 on
# 		a case-insensitive file system.
#
# 		If you are using InnoDB tables, you should set this variable to 1 on all platforms to force names to be converted
# 		to lowercase.
#
# 		The setting of this variable in MySQL 8.0 affects the behavior of replication filtering options with regard
# 		to case sensitivity. (Bug #51639)
#
# 		It is prohibited to start the server with a lower_case_table_names setting that is different from the setting used
# 		when the server was initialized.
#
# 		The restriction is necessary because collations used by various data dictionary table fields are based on the
#	 	setting defined when the server is initialized and restarting the server with a different setting would
# 		introduce inconsistencies with respect to how identifiers are ordered and compared.
#
# mandatory_roles
#
# 		cmd line format: 				--mandatory-roles=value
# 		introduced: 					8.0.2
# 		Sys var: 						mandatory_roles
# 		Scope: 							Global
# 		Dynamic: 						Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 					No
# 		Type: 							String
# 		Default: 						empty string
#
# 		Roles the server should treat as mandatory. In effect, these roles are automatically
# 		granted to every user, although setting mandatory_roles does not actually change any
# 		user accounts, and the granted roles are not visible in the mysql.role_edges system table.
#
# 		The var value is a comma separated name:
#
# 		SET PERSIST mandatory_roles = '`role1`@`%`, `role2`,role3,role4@localhost';
#
# 		Setting mandatory_roles requires the ROLE_ADMIN priv, in addition to the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER
# 		priv normally required to set a global system var.
#
# 		Role names consist of a user part and host part in user_name@host_name format.
# 		The host part, if omitted, defaults to %
#
# 		User names and host names, if quoted, must be written in a fashion permitted for quoting within quoted strings.
#
# 		Roles named in the value of mandatory_roles cannot be revoked with REVOKE or dropped with DROP_ROLE or DROP_USER.
#
# 		Mandatory roles, like explicitly granted roles, do not take effect until activated.
#
# 		At login time, role activation occurs for all granted roles if the activate_all_roles_on_login sys_var is enabled,
# 		or only for roles that are set as default roles otherwise.
#
# 		At runtime, SET_ROLE activates roles.
#
# 		Roles that do not exist when assigned to mandatory_roles but are created later may require special treatment
# 		to be considered mandatory.
#
# 		SHOW_GRANTS displays mandatory roles according to the rules showcased later.

#
# 		Max size of one packet or any generated/intermediate string or any parameter sent by the mysql_stmt_send_long_data() C API function.
# 		The default is 64MB.
#
# 		The packet message buffer is initialized to net_buffer_length bytes, but can grow up to max_allowed_packet bytes when needed.
# 		This value by default is small, to catch large (possibly incorrect) packets.
#
# 		You must increase this value if you are using large BLOB columns or long strings.
# 		It should be as big as the largest BLOB you want to use.
#
# 		The protocol limit for max_allowed_packet is 1GB. The value should be a multiple of 1024: nonmultiples are rounded down to the nearest
# 		multiple.
#
# 		When you change the message buffer size by changing the value of the max_allowed_packet variable, you should also change
# 		the buffer size on the client side if your client program permits it.
#
# 		The default max_allowed_packet value built in to the client library is 1GB, but individual client programs
# 		might override this.
#
# 		For example, mysql and mysqldump have defaults of 16MB and 24MB, respectively.
#
# 		They also enable you to change the client-side value by setting max_allowed_packet on the cmd line or in an option file.
#
# 		The session value of this var is read only. The client can receive up to as many bytes as the session value.
# 		However, the server will not send to the client more bytes than the current global max_allowed_packet value.
# 		(The global value could be less than the session value if the global value is changed after the client connects.)

# 		If more than this many successive connection requests from a host are interuppted without a successful
# 		connection, the server blocks that host from further connections.
#
# 		You can unblock blocked hosts by flushing the host cache. To do so, issue a FLUSH_HOSTS statement or execute
# 		a mysqladmin flush-hosts command.
#
# 		If a connection is established successfully within fewer than max_connect_errors attempts after a previous connection
# 		was interrupted, the error count for the host is cleared to 0.
#
# 		However, once a host is blocked, flushing the host cache is the only way to unblock it. Default is 100.

#
# 		max number of bytes available for computing normalized statement digests.
#
# 		Once said amount of space is used during digest computation, truncation occurs:
# 		No further tokens from a parsed statement are collected or figure into its digest value.
#
# 		Statements that differ only after that many bytes of parsed tokens produce the same 
# 		normalized statement digest and are considered identical if compared or if aggregated for digest stats.
#
# 		Decreasing the max_digest_length value reduces memory use but causes the digest value of more statements
# 		to become indistinguishable if they differ only at the end.
#
# 		Increasing the value permits longer statements to be distinguished but increases memory use, particularly
# 		for workloads that involve large number of simultaneous sessions (the server allocates max_digest_length bytes per session)
#
# 		The parser uses this system var as a limit on the max length of normalized statement digests that it computes.
# 		The Performance Schema, if it tracks statement digests, makes a copy of the digest value, using the performance_schema_max_digest_length,
# 		sys var as a limit on the max length of digests that it stores.
#
# 		Consequently, if performance_schema_max_digest_length is less than max_digest_length digest values stored in the Performance
# 		Schema are truncated relative to the original digest values.

#
# 		max_execution_time applies as follows:
#
# 			The global max_execution_time value provides the default for the session value for new connections.
# 			The session value applies to SELECT executions executed within the session that include no MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(N)
# 			optimizer hint or for which N is 0.
#
# 			max_execution_time applies to read-only SELECT statements. Statements that are not read only are those that

#
# 		Setting this variable has no effect on any existing MEMORY table, unless the table is

#
# 		A server restart also sets the maximum size of existing MEMORY tables to the global max_heap_table_size 
#

# 		or row combinations (for multiple-table statements) or that are likely to do more than max_join_size disk seeks.
#
# 		By setting this value, you can catch statements where keys are not used properly and that would probably take a long time.
# 		Set this if you use to perform joins that lack a WHERE clause, that take a long time or return more than millions of rows.
#
# 		Setting this var to other than DEFAULT resets the value of sql_big_selects to 0.

#
# 		If the value is set lower than the current number of prepared statements, existing statements are not
# 		affected and can be used, but no new statements can be prepared until the current number drops below the limit.

# 		Limit the assumed max number of seeks when looking up rows based on a key.
# 		The MySQL optimizer assumes that no more than this number of key seeks are
# 		required when searching for matching rows in a table by scanning an index, regardless

#
# 		By setting it to a low value, for instance 100 - you can force MySQL to prefer indexes

#
# 		The path name of the process ID file. This var can be set with the --pid-file option.
#
# 		The server creates the file in the data dir unless an absolute path name is given
# 		to specify a different dir.
#
# 		If you specify the --pid-file option, you must specify a value.
#
# 		If you do not specify the --pid-file option, MySQL uses a default
# 		value of <host_name>.pid where <host_name> is the name of the host machine.
#
# 		The process ID file is used by other programs such as mysqld_safe to determine 
# 		the server's process ID.

#
# 		If the plugin dir is writable by server, it may be possible for a user to write
# 		executable code to a file in the dir using SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE
#
# 		This can be prevented by making plugin_dir read only to the server or by setting

#
# 		This var is used for internal server use.
#
# 		AS of MySQL 8.0.14, setting the session value of this sys var is a restricted ops.
#
# 		The session user must have the privs to set it.
#
# 		In MysQL >= 8.0.14 - pseudo_slave_mode has the following effects on the handling of a statement that
# 		sets one or more unsupported or unknown SQL modes:
#
# 			If true - the server ignores the unsupported mode and raises a warning
#
# 			If false - the server rejects the statement with ER_UNSUPPORTED_SQL_MODE
#

# 		This buffer is not freed between statements.
#
# 		If you are running complex queries, a larger query_prealloc_size value might

# rand_seed1
#
# 		sys var: 				rand_seed1
# 		Scope: 					Session
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes

#
# 		The rand_seed1 and rand_seed2 vars exist as session vars only, and can be set but not read.
# 		The variable - but not their values - are shown in the output of SHOW_VARIABLES.
#
# 		The purpose of these vars is to support replication of the RAND() function.
# 		For statements that invoke RAND(), the master passes two values to the slave -
# 		where they are used to seed the RNG.
#
# 		The slave uses these values to set the session vars rand_seed1 and rand_seed2 so that RAND()

# 		Type: 			Enumeration
# 		Default: 		STRICT
# 		Valid: 			IDEMPOTENT, STRICT
#
# 		For internal use by mysqlbinlog.
# 		The variable switches the server between IDEMPOTENT mode and STRICT mode.
#
# 		IDEMPOTENT mode causes suppression of duplicate-key and no-key found errors
# 		in BINLOG statements generated by mysqlbinlog.		
#
# 		This mode is useful when replaying a row-based binary log on a server that causes
# 		conflicts with existing data. 
#
# 		mysqlbinlog sets this mode when you specify the --idempotent option by writing the following:
#
# 		SET SESSION RBR_EXEC_MODE=IDEMPOTENT;
#
# 		As of MySQL 8.0.14 - setting the session value of this sys var is a restricted ops.
# 		Reqs privs.

# 		Type: 					Integer
# 		Default: 				131072
# 		Min: 						8200
# 		Max: 						<a lot>
#
# 		Each thread that does a sequential scan for a MyISAM table allocates a buffer of this size (in bytes)
# 		for each table it scans.
#
# 		If you do many sequential scans, you might want to increase this value.
#
# 		Value of this var should be % 4kb. If it set to a value which is not, it's rounded down to closest % 4kb value.
#
# 		Is also used in the following context for all storage engines:
#
# 			For caching the indexes in a temporary file (not a temp table), when sorting rows for ORDER BY.
#
# 			For bulk insert into partitions.
#
# 			For caching results of nested queries.
#
# 		read_buffer_size is also used in one other storage engine-specific way: To determine the memory block size
# 		for MEMORY tables.
#
# read_only
#
# 		cmd line format: 		--read-only
# 		Sys var: 				read_only
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		When the read_only sys var is enabled, the server permits no client updates except
# 		from users who have the CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privs.
#
# 		This var is disabled by default.
#
# 		The server also supports a super_read_only sys var (disabled by default), which has these effects:
#
# 			If super_read_only is enabled, the server prohibits client updates, even from users who have the SUPER priv.
#
# 			Setting super_read_only to ON implicitly forces read_only to ON.
#
# 			Setting read_only to OFF implicitly forces super_read_only to OFF.
#
# 		Even with read_only enabled, the server permits these operations:
#
# 			Updates performed by slave threads, if the server is a replication slave. 
#
# 			In replication setups, it can be useful to enable read_only on slave servers
# 			to ensure that slaves accept updates only from the master server and not from clients.
#
# 			Use of ANALYZE_TABLE or OPTIMIZE_TABLE statements. The purpose of read-only mode is to prevent
# 			changes to table structure or contents.
#
# 			Analysis and optimization do not qualify as such changes. 
#
# 			This means for example, that consistency checks on read-only replication slaves can be performed with
# 			mysqlcheck --all-databases --analyze
#
# 			Operations on TEMPORARY tables
#
# 			Inserts into the log tables (mysql.general_log and mysql.slow_log)
#
# 			Updates to Performance Schema tables, such as UPDATE or TRUNCATE TABLE operations.
#
# 		Changes to read_only on a master server are not replicated to slave servers. 
# 		The value can be set on a slave server independent of the setting on the master.
#
# 		The following conditions apply to attempts to enable read_only (including implicit attempts resulting from enabling super_read_only):
# 
# 			The attempt fails and an error occurs if you have any explicit locks (acquired with LOCK_TABLES) or have a pending transaction.
#
# 			The attempt blocks while other clients hold explicit table locks or have pending transactions, until the locks are released and
# 			the trans ends. 
# 			
# 			While the attempt to enable read_only is pending, requests by other clients for table locks or to begin trans also block until read_only has been set.
#
# 			The attempt blocks if there are active transactions that hold metadata locks, until those transactions end.
#
# 			read_only can be enabled while you hold a global read lock (acquired with FLUSH_TABLES_WITH_READ_LOCK) because that does
# 			not involve table locks.

# 			SET_VAR Hint: 			Yes
# 			Type: 					Integer
# 			Default: 				262144
# 			Min: 						1
# 			Max: 						<less>
#
# 			This var is used for reads from MyISAM tables and for any storage engine, for multi-range read optimization.
#
# 			When reading rows from a MyISAM table in sorted order following a key-sorting operation, the rows
# 			are read through this buffer to avoid disk seeks.
#
# 			Setting this variable to a large value can improve ORDER BY performance by a lot.
# 			However, this is a buffer allocated for each client - so you should not set the global variable to a large value.
#
# 			Instead, the session value can be large for where you need to run large queries.

# 			SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 			Type: 					Boolean
# 			Default: 				OFF
# 			
#
# 			Whether client connections to the server are required to use some form of secure transport.
# 			When this variable is enabled, the server permits only TCP/IP connections that use SSL,
# 			or connections that use a socket file (on Unix) or shared memory (on Windows).
#
# 			The server rejects nonsecure connection attempts, which fail with an ER_SECURE_TRANSPORT_REQUIRED error.
#
# 			This capability supplements per-account SSL reqs, which takes precedence.
#
# 			For example,if an acc is defined with REQUIRE SSL - enabling require_secure_transport
# 			does not make it possible to use the account to connect using a Unix socket file.
#
# 			It is possible for a server to have no secure transports available. For example, a server on Windows
# 			supports no secure transports if started without specifying any SSL cert or key files and with
# 			the shared_memory SYS_VAR disabled.
#
# 			Under said conditions, attempts to enable require_secure_transport at startup cause the server to write
# 			a message to the error log and exit. Attempts to enable the variable at runtime fail with an ER_NO_SECURE_TRANSPORTS_CONFIGURED
# 			error.

# 			Valid: 				FULL, NONE
#
# 			For connections for which metadata transfer is optional, the client sets the resultset_metadata
# 			SYS var to control whether the server returns result set metadata.
#
# 			Permitted values are FULL (return all metadata; this is the default) and NONE (return no metadata)
#
# 			For connections that are not metadata-optional, setting resultset_metadata to NONE produces an error.

#
# 			Used to limit the effect of data import and export operations, such as those performed
# 			by the LOAD_DATA and SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE statements and the LOAD_FILE() function.
#
# 			Permitted only to users with FILE priv.
#
# 			secure_file_priv can be set as follows:
#
# 				If empty - var has no effect. Not a secure setting.
#
# 				If name of a dir, the server limits import and export ops to work only with files in that dir.
# 				The dir must exist, the server will not create it.
#
# 				If set to NULL, the server disables import and export ops.
#
# 			The default value is platform specific and depends on the value of the INSTALL_LAYOUT CMake option,
# 			as shown as follows:
#
# 			(To specify the default secure_file_priv value explicitly if you are building from source, use the 
# 			INSTALL_SECURE_FILE_PRIVDIR CMake option.)
#
# 				INSTALL_LAYOUT Value 		Default secure_file_priv Value
# 				STANDALONE, WIN 				empty
# 				DEB, RPM, SLES, SVR4 		/var/lib/mysql-files
# 				Otherwise 						mysql-files under the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value
#
# 			The server checks the value of secure_file_priv at startup and writes a warning to the error log
# 			if the value is insecure.
#
# 			A non-NULL value is considered insecure if it is empty, or the value is the dara dir or a subdir of it,
# 			or a sub-dir that is accessible by all users.
#
# 			If secure_file_priv is set to a nonexistent path, the server writes an error message to the error log and exits.

# 			Min: 						0
# 			Max: 						<a lot>
#
# 			Specifies the server ID. This variable is set by the --server-id option.
# 			The server_id sys var is set to 1 by default.
#
# 			The server can be started with this default ID, but when bin log is enabled,
# 			an informational message is issued if you did not specify a server ID explicitly using the --server-id option.
#
# 			For servers that are used in a replication topology, you must specify a unique server ID for each replication
# 			server, in the range from 1 to 2^32 - 1. "Unique" means that each ID must be different from other IDs in use by 
# 			any other replication master or slave.
#
# 			If the server ID is set to 0, binary logging takes place - but a master server with a server ID of 0
# 			refuses any connections from slaves and a slave with a server ID of 0 refuses to connect to a master.
#
# 			Note that although you can change the server ID dynamically to a nonzero value, doing so does not
# 			enable replication to start immediately.
#
# 			You must change the server ID and then restart the server to initialize the replication slave.

#
# 			Controls whether the server tracks GTIDs within the current session and returns them to the client.
# 			Depending on the variable value, at the end of executing each transaction, the server GTIDs are captured
# 			by the tracker and returned to the client.
#
# 			These session_track_gtids values are permitted:
#
# 				OFF: Track collects no GTIDs. Default.
#
# 				OWN_GTID: The track collects GTIDs generated by successfully committed read/write transactions.
#
# 				ALL_GTIDS: The track collects all GTIDs in the gtid_executed SYS_VAR at the time the current transaction commits,
# 				regardless of whether the transaction is read/write or read only.
#

# 			Scope: 					Global, Session
# 			Dynamic: 				Yes
# 			SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 			Type: 					Boolean
# 			Default: 				ON
#
# 			Controls whether the server tracks when the default schema (database) is set within the current session
# 			and notifies the client to make the schema name available.
#
# 			If the schema name tracked is enabled, name notification occurs each time the default schema is set,

# 			Type: 					Boolean
# 			Default: 				OFF
#
# 			Controls whether the server tracks changes to the state of the current session and notifies
# 			the client when state changes occur.
#
# 			Changes can be reported for these attributes of client session state:
#
# 				Default schema (db)
#
# 				Session-specific values for sys vars.
#
# 				User-defined vars
#
# 				Temp tables
#
# 				Prepared statements
#
# 			If the session state tracker is enabled, notification occurs for each change that involves tracked session attributes,
# 			even if the new attribute values are the same as the old.
#
# 			For example, setting a user-defined variable to its current value results in a notification.
#
# 			The session_track_state_change variable controls only notification of when changes occur, not what the changes are.
#
# 			For example, state-change notifications occur when the default schema is set or tracked session SYS vars are assigned,
# 			but the notification does not include the schema name or variable values.
#
# 			To receive notification of the schema name or session sys var values - use the session_track_schema or session_track_system_variables
# 			SYS_Vars respectively.
#
# 			NOTE: Assigning a value to session_track_state_change itself is not considered a state change and is not reported as such.
# 					However, if its name is listed in the value of session_track_system_variables, any assignments to it do result in notification of the new value.

# 			Type: 					String
# 			Default: 				time_zone, autocommit, character_set_client, character_set_results,
# 										character_set_connection
#
# 			Controls whether the server tracks assignments to session system vars and notifies the client of the name
# 			and value of each assigned variable.
#
# 			The variable value is a comma-separated list of variables for which to track assignments.
#
# 			By default, notification is enabled for time_zone, autocommit, character_set_client,
# 			character_set_results and character_set_connection.
#
# 			(The latter three vars are those affacted by SET_NAMES)
#
# 			Wildcard * all denotation can be given.
#
# 			To disable notification session vars assignments, set session_track_system_variables to the

# 			Default: 				OFF
# 			Valid: 					OFF, STATE, CHARACTERISTICS
#
# 			Controls whether the server tracks the state and characteristics of transactions within the current session
# 			and notifies the client to make this information available.
#
# 			These session_track_transaction_info values are permitted:
#
# 				OFF: Disable transaction state tracking. Default.
#
# 				STATE: Enable transaction state tracking without characteristics tracking.
# 						 State tracking enables the client to determine whether a transaction is in progress
# 						 and whether it could be moved to a different session without being rolled back.
#
# 				CHARACTERISTICS: Enable transaction state tracking, including chars tracking. Characteristics tracking enables
# 						 the client to determine how to restart a transaction in another session so that it has the same
# 						 characteristics as in the original session.
#
# 						The following chars are relevant:
#
# 						READ ONLY
# 						READ WRITE
# 						ISOLATION LEVEL
# 						WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT
#
# 				For a client to safely relocate a transaction to another session, it must track not only transaction
# 				state but also transaction characteristics. 
#
# 				In addition, the client must track the transaction_read_only and transaction_isolation SYS_VAR to correctly determine the session defaults.
#
# 				(To track these, list them in the value of the session_track_system_variables SYS_VAR)

#
# 				At minimum the sort_buffer_size value must be large enough to accomodate fifteen tuples in the sort buffer.
# 				Also, increasing the value of max_sort_length may require increasing the value of sort_buffer_size.
#
# 				If you see many Sort_merge_passes per second in SHOW_GLOBAL_STATUS output, you can consider increasing the
# 				sort_buffer_size value to speed up ORDER BY or GROUP BY operations that cannot be improved with query
# 				optimization or improved indexing.
#
# 				The optimizer tries to work out how much space is needed but can allocate more, up to said limit.
# 				Setting it larger than required globally will slow down most queries that sort.
#
# 				Best ot increase as session setting, and only for sessions that need a larger size.
#
# 				On Linux, there are thresholds of 256kb and 2MB where larger values may significantly
# 				slow down memory allocation - so you should consider staying below one of said sizes.
#
# 				The max permissible setting for sort_buffer_size is 4GB-1. Larger values are allowed for 64-bit platforms.

# 				Dynamic: 		Yes
# 				SET_VAR Hint: 	Yes
# 				Type: 			Boolean
# 				Default: 		OFF
#
# 				If this is enabled, then after a statement that successfully inserts an automatically generated AUTO_INCREMENT value,
# 				you can find said value with a query of:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM <tbl_name> WHERE <auto_col> IS NULL
#
# 				If the statement returns a row, the value returned is the same as if you invoked the LAST_INSERT_ID() function.
#
# 				If no AUTO_INCREMENT value was successfully inserted, the SELECT statement returns no row.
#
# 				The beavior of retrieving an AUTO_INCREMENT value by using an IS_NULL comparison is used by some
# 				ODBC programs, such as Access.
#
# 				This beavior can be disabled by setting sql_auto_is_null to OFF.

# 				Default: 		ON
#
# 				If set to OFF, MySQL aborts SELECT statements that are likely to take a long time to execute (statements that estimate > rows cmp. to max_join_size)
#
# 				Useful when an inadivsable WHERE statement has been issued.
# 				The default value for a new connection is ON, which permits all SELECT statements.

#
# 				If enabled, sql_buffer_result forces results from SELECT statements to be put into temporary tables.
#
# 				This helps MySQL free the table locks early and can be beneficial in cases where it takes a long time
# 				to send results to the client. The default value is OFF.

# 				SET_VAR Hint: 			Yes
# 				Type: 					Boolean
# 				Default: 				OFF
#
# 				Whether statements that create new tables or alter the structure of existing tables enforce the requirement that tables have a primary key.
#
# 				Setting this is a restricted ops.
#
# 				Enabling this variable helps avoid performance probblems in row-based replication that can occur when tables
# 				have no primary key.
#
# 				Suppose that a table has no primary key and an update or delete modifies multiple rows.
#
# 				On the master server, this ops can be performed using a single table scan but, when replicate
# 				using row-based replication, results in a table scan for each row to be modified on the slave.
#
# 				With a primary key, these table scans do not occur.
#
# 				sql_require_primary_key applies to both base tables and TEMPORARY tables, and changes to its
# 				value are replicated to slave servers.
#
# 				When enabled, sql_require_primary_key has these effects:
#
# 					Attempts to create a new table with no primary key fail with an error.
#
# 					This includes CREATE TABLE ... LIKE. It also includes CREATE TABLE ... SELECT,
# 					unless the CREATE TABLE includes a primary key def.
#
# 					Attempts to drop the primary key from an existing table fail with an error, with the exception
# 					that dropping the primary key and adding a primary key in the same ALTER TABLE statement is permitted.
#
# 					Dropping the primary key fails even if the table also contains a UNIQUE NOT NULL index.

# 					The value of this variable if specified in terms of the number of stored routines held
# 					in each of the two caches maintained by the MySQL Server for, respectively, stored procedures
# 					and stored functions. 				
#
# 					Whenever a stored routine is executed this cache size is checked before the first or top-level

# 					the corresponding cache is flushed and memory previously allocated for cached objects is freed.
#
# 					This allows for the cache to be flushed safely, even when there are dependencies between stored
# 					routines.
#
# 					The stored procedure and stored function cache exists in parallel with the stored program definition
# 					cache partition of the dictionary object cache.
#
# 					The stored procedure and stored function caches are per connection, while the stored program

#
# 					Unused stored program definition objects are only kept in the dictionary object cache

# 					The stored_program_cache option sets a soft upper limit for the number of cached stored procedures
# 					or functions per connection, and the limits is checked each time a connection executes a stored

# 					Type: 					String
# 					Default: 				empty string
#
# 					The tag to be added to the server identifier in error log output written to syslog or 
# 					the Windows Event Log.
#
# 					This var is unavailable unless the log_sink_syseventlog error log component is installed.
#
# 					By default, no tag is set - so the server identifier is simply MySQL on Windows,
# 					and mysqld on other platforms.
#
# 					If a tag value of <tag> is specified, it is appended to the server identifier with
# 					a leading hyphen, resulting in a syslog identifier of mysqld-<tag> (or MySQL-<tag> on Windows)
# 					
# 					On Windows, to use a tag that does not already exist, the server must be run from an account
# 					with Administrator privs, to permit creation of a registry entry for the tag.

# 					The server system time zone. When the server begins executing, it inherits a time zone
# 					setting from the machine defaults, possibly modified by the environment of the account
# 					used for running the server or the startup script.
#
# 					The value is used to set system_time_zone. Typically the time zone is specified by the

#
# 					It also can be specified using the --timezone option of the mysqld_safe script.
#
# 					The system_time_zone variable differs from time_zone. Although they might have the same value,

# 					Default: 			-1 (Autosizing;do not assign this literal value)
# 					Min: 					400
# 					Max: 					524288
#
# 					The number of table defs that can be stored in the def cache. 
#
# 					If you use a large number of tables, you can create a large table def cache to speed up opening of tables.
# 
#  				The table definition cache takes less space and does not use file descriptors, unlike the normal table cache.
# 					The minimum value is 400.
#
# 					The default value is based on the following formula, capped to a limit of 2000:
#
# 						MIN(400 + table_open_cache / 2, 2000)
#
# 					For InnoDB, table_definition_cache acts as a soft limit for the number of open table instances in the InnoDB
# 					data dir cache.
#
# 					If the number of open table instances exceed the table_definition_cache setting, the LRU mechanism begins to mark
# 					table instances for eviction and eventually removes them from the data dictionary cache.
#
#					The limit helps address situations in which significant amounts of memory would be used to cache
# 					rarely used table instances until the next server restart.
#
# 					The number of table instances with cached metadata could be higher than the limit defined by 
# 					table_definition_cache, because parent and child table instances with foreign key relationships
# 					are not placed on the LRU list and are not subject to eviction from memory.
#
# 					Additionally, table_definition_cache defines a soft limit for the number of InnoDB file-per-table tablespaces
# 					that can be open at one time, which is also controlled by innodb_open_files.
#
# 					If both table_definition_cache and innodb_open_files are set, the highest setting is used.
# 					If neither variable is set, table_definition_cache, which has a higher default value is used.
#
# 					If the number of open tablespace file handles exceeds the limit defined by table_definition_cache
# 					or innodb_open_files, the LRU mechanism searches the tablespace file LRU list for files that are
# 					fully flushed and are not currently being extended.
#
# 					The process is performed each time a new tablespace is opened. If there are no "inactive" tablespaces,
# 					no tablespace files are closed.
#
# 					The table definition cache exists in parallel with the table definition cache partition of the dictionary
# 					object cache.
#
# 					Both caches store table definitions but serve different parts of the MySQL server.
# 					Objects in one cache have no dependence on the existence of objects in the other.

#
# 					To improve scalability by reducing contention among sessions, the open tables cache 
# 					can be partitioned into several smaller cache instances of size table_open_cache/table_open_cache_instances.
#
# 					A session needs to lock only one instance to access it for DML statements.

#
# 					(DDL statements still require a lock on the entire cache, but such statements are much less

#
# 					How many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects,
# 					the client's threads are put in the cache if there are fewer than thread_cache_size
# 					threads there.
#
# 					Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible,
# 					and only when the cache is empty is a new thread created.
#
# 					This variable can be increased to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections.
# 					Normally, this does not provide a notable performance improvement if you have a good
# 					thread implementation.
#
# 					However, if your server sees hundreds of connections per second you should normally
# 					set thread_cache_size high enough so that most new connections use cached threads.
#
# 					By examining the difference between the Connections and Threads created status variables,
# 					you can see how efficient the thread cache is.
#
# 					The default value is based on the following formula, capped to a limit of 100:

# 					Default: 				0
# 					Min: 						0
# 					Max: 						1
#
# 					This var controls which algorithm the thread pool plugin uses:
#
# 						A value of 0 (the default) uses a conservative low-concurrency algorithm which is most well tested and stable.
#
# 						A value of 1 increases the concurrency and uses a more aggressive algo which at times can perform 5-10% better,
# 						on optimal thread counts, but has degrading performance as the number of connections increases. (Experimental, not supported)
#
# 					Available only if the thread pool plugin is enabled.
# 
# thread_pool_high_priority_connection

# 					Min: 						0
# 					Max: 						1
#
# 					Affects queuing of new statements prior to execution.
#
# 					If the value is 0 (false, default) - statement queuing uses both the low-prio
# 					and high-prio queues.
#
# 					If the value is 1 (true), queued statements always go to the high prio queue.
#
# 					Only available if the thread pool plugin is enabled.

# 					Type: 					Integer
# 					Default: 				0
# 					Min: 						0
# 					Max: 						4096
#
# 					Max permitted number of unused threads in the thread pool.
# 					This variable makes it possible to limit the amount of memory used by sleeping threads.
#
# 					A value of 0 (default) means no limit on the number of sleeping threads.
#
# 					A value of N where N is greater than 0, means 1 consumer thread and N-1 reserve threads.
#
# 					In this case, if a thread is ready to sleep but the number of sleeping threads is already at maximum,
# 					the thread exits rather than going to sleep.
#
# 					A sleeping thread is either sleeping as a consumer thread or a reserve thread.
# 					The thread pool permits one thread to be the consumer thread when sleeping.
#
# 					if a thread goes to sleep and there is no existing consumer thread, it will sleep as a consumer thread.
#
# 					When a thread must be woken up, a consumer thread is selected if there is one.
# 					A reserve thread is selected only when there is no consumer thread to wake up.
#
# 					Only available if the thread pool plugin is enabled.

# 					Default: 				1000
# 					Min: 						0
# 					Max: 						<a lot>
#
# 					Affects statements waiting for execution in the low-prio queue.
# 					The value is the number of MS before a waiting statement is moved to the high-prio queue.
#
# 					Default is 1000 ms (1 sec). Range is 0 to 2^32-2

# 					Type: 					Integer
# 					Default: 				16
# 					Min: 						1
# 					Max: 						64
#
# 					Number of thread groups in the thread pool. 
# 					This is the most important parameter controlling thread pool performance.
#
# 					It affects how many statements can execute simultaneously.
#
# 					Defaults to 16, with a range from 1 to 64. Must be within range, plugin won't load and a error is written to the log.
#
# 					Only available if the thread pool plugin is enabled.

## 				SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 					Type: 					Integer
## 				Default: 				6
# 					Min: 						4
# 					Max: 						600
#
# 					Affects executing statements. 
#
# 					The value is the amount of time a statement has to finish after starting to execute before it becomes
# 					defined as stalled, at which point the thread pool permits the thread group to begin
# 					executing another statement.
#
# 					The value is measured in 10 milliseconds units, so a value of 6 (default),
# 					means 60ms.
#
# 					The range of values is 4 to 600 (40ms to 6s).
#
# 					Short wait values permits threads to start more quickly.
# 					Short values are also better for avoiding deadlock situations.
#
# 					Long wait values are useful for workloads that include long-running statements,
# 					to avoid starting too many new statements while the current ones execute.
#
# 					Only available if thread pool plugin is enabled.

# 					Max (64-bit) 		<a lot>
# 					Max (32-bit) 		<less>
#
# 					Block Size: 		1024
#
# 					The stack size for each thread. Default is 192KB (256KB for 64-bit Systems) is large enough for most ops.
#
# 					If the thread stack size is too small, it limits the complexity of the SQL statements that the server can handle,
# 					the recursion depth of stored procedures and other memory-consuming actions.

# time_format - Removed in 8.0.3
#
# time_zone 
#
# 					Sys var: 		time_zone
# 					Scope: 			Global, Session
# 					Dynamic: 		Yes
# 					SET_VAR Hint: 	No
# 					Type: 			String
#
# 					The current time zone. 
#
# 					This variable is used to initialize the time zone for each client that connects.
# 					By default, the initial value of this is 'SYSTEM' (basically use the system_time_zone)
#
# 					Can be specified explicitly at server startup with the --default-time-zone option.
#
# 					NOTE: If set to SYSTEM, every MySQL function call that requires a timezone calc, makes a system lib call to find out the
# 							current system timezone. May be protected by a global mutex, resulting on contention.
#
# timestamp
#
# 					Sys var: 		timestamp
# 					Scope: 			Session
# 					Dynamic: 		Yes
# 					SET_VAR Hint: 	Yes
# 					Type: 			Numeric
#
# 					Set the time for this client. 
#
# 					This is used to get the original timestamp if you use the binary log to restore rows.
# 					<timestamp_value> should be a Unix epoch timestamp (a value like that returned by UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - not a 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'),
# 					or DEFAULT.
#
# 					Setting timestamp to a constant value causes it to retain that value until it is changed again.
# 					Setting timestamp to DEFAULT causes its value to be the current date and time as of the time it is accessed.
#
# 					In MySQL 8.0, timestamp is a DOUBLE rather than BIGINT because its value includes a microseconds part.
#
# 					SET timestamp affects the value returned by NOW() but not by SYSDATE().
#					This means that timestamp settings in the binary log have no effect on invocations of
# 					SYSDATE().
#
# 					The server can be started with the --sysdate-is-now option to cause SYSDATE() to be an alias for NOW(),
# 					in which case SET timestamp affects both functions.
#
# tls_version

# 					Default (<= 8.0.4) 	TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 (OpenSSL), TLSv1, TLSv1.1 (yaSSL)
#
# 					The protocols permitted by the server for encrypted connections.
# 					The value is a comma-separated list containing one or more protocol names.
#
# 					The protocols that can be named for this variable depends on the SSL library used to compile
# 					MySQL.
#
# tmp_table_size
#
# 					cmd line format: 		--tmp-table-size=#

# 					Type: 					Integer
# 					Default: 				16777216
# 					Min: 						1024
# 					Max: 						<a lot>
#
# 					Max size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Does not apply to user-created MEMORY tables.
#
# 					The actual limit is determined from whichever of the values of tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size
# 					is smaller.
#
# 					If an in-memory temporary table exceeds the limit, MySQL automatically converts it to an on-disk
# 					temporary table.
#
# 					The internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine option defines the storage engine used for on-disk temporary tables.
#
# 					Increase the value of tmp_table_size (and max_heap_table_size if necessary) if you do many advanced
# 					GROUP BY queries and you have lots of memory.
#
# 					You can compare the number of internal on-disk temporary tables created to the total number of internal
# 					temp tables created by comparing the values of the Created_tmp_disk_tables and Created_tmp_tables Vars.
#
# tmpdir
#
# 					cmd line format: 		--tmpdir=dir_name
# 					Sys_var: 				tmpdir
# 					Scope: 					Global
# 					Dynamic: 				No
# 					SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 					Type: 					Dir name
#
# 					The dir used for temp files and temp tables.
#
# 					This var can be set to a list of several paths that are used in round-robin regards.
#
# 					Paths should be separated by : on Unix and ; on Windows.
#
# 					The multiple-directory feature can be used to spread the load between several physical disks.
# 
#	 				If the MySQL server is acting as a replication slave, you should not set tmpdir to point to a dir
# 					on a memory-based file system or to a dir that is cleared when the server host restarts.
# 
# 					A replication slave needs some of its temp files to survive a machine restart so that it can replicate
# 					temporary tables or LOAD_DATA_INFILE operations.
#
# 					If files in the temporary file dir are lost when the server restarts, replication fails.
#
# 					You can set the slave's temp dir using the slave_load_tmpdir variable.
#
# 					In that case, the slave will not use the general tmpdir value and you can set tmpdir to a nonpermanent location.

#
# 					Can be set directly, or indirectly using the SET_TRANSACTION statement.
#
# 					If you set transaction_isolation directly to an isolation level name that contains a space,
# 					the name should be enclosed with '' and spaces replaced with -
#
# 					SET transaction_isolation = 'READ-COMMITTED';
#
# 					Any unique prefix of a valid value may be used to set the value of this var.
#
# 					The default transaction isolation level can also be set at startup using the --transaction-isolation server option.
#
# 					This var has nonstandard semantics for runtime changes to the session value made using the SET statement.
# 					For most session sys_vars - these statements are the same:
#
# 					SET @@var_name = value;
# 					SET @@session.var_name = value;
#
# 					For transaction_isolation, these semantics apply instead:
#
# 						SET @@transaction_isolation = <value>
#
# 							Not permitted within transactions.
#
# 							Set the value only for the next single transaction within the session.
#
# 						SET @@session.transaction_isolation = <value>
#
# 							Permitted within transactions, but does not affect the current ongoing transaction.
#
# 							Sets the value for all subsequent transactions within the session.

# 					Block size: 			1024
#
# 					There is a per-transaction memory pool from which various transaction-related allocations take memory.
# 					The initial size of the pool in bytes is transaction_prealloc_size.
#
# 					For every allocation that cannot be satisfied from the pool because it has insufficient memory available,

#
# 					When the transaction ends, the pool is truncated to transaction_prealloc_size bytes.

#
# 					Can be set directly, or indirectly using the SET_TRANSACTION statement.
#
# 					To set the default transaction access mode at startup, use the --transaction-read-only server option.

#
# 					If you know for certain that your data does not contain uniqueness violations, you can set this

# 					SET_VAR Hint: 	No
# 					Type: 			Boolean
# 					Default: 		ON
#
# 					If this var is enabled (default), the server checks each user account and produces a warning if conditions are

#
# The following section pertains to Using System Variables:
#
# The MySQL server maintains many system variables that configure its operation.
#
# Each sys var has a default. Can be set at server startup using options on the cmd line or in a option file.
#
# Most of them can be changed dynamically while the server is running by means of the SET statement,
# which enables you to modify operation of the server without having to stop and restart it.
#
# Can also use them in expressions.
#
# Many of the sys vars are built in, but can be installed by server plugins or components:
#
# 		System vars implemented by a server plugin are exposed when the plugin is installed and have
# 		names taht begin with the plugin name.
#
# 		For example - audit_log implements a sys_var named audit_log_policy
#
# 		System vars implemented by a server component are exposed when the component is installed and have
# 		names that begin with a component-specific prefix.
#
# 		For instance - log_filter_dragment is a error log filter component that puts in a sys_var of log_error_filter_rules,
# 		full name is dragnet.log_error_filter_rules. Use full name for this.
#
# There are two scopes for sys vars -> global and session.
#
# Global is for overall, systemwide
#
# Session is for individual client conns. A sys var can have both.
#
# 		When the server starts, it initializes each global variable to its default value.
# 		These defaults can be changed by options specified on the cmd line or in an option file.
#
# 		The server also maintains a set of session variables for each client that connects.
#
# 		The client's session variables are initialized at connect time using the current values of 
# 		the corresponding global vars.
#
# 		For example, a client's SQL mode is controlled by the session sql_mode value - initialized when
# 		the client connects to the value of the global sql_mode value.
#
# 		For some system variables, the session value is not intialized from the corresponding global value;
# 		if so, that is indicated in the variable desc.
#
# System var values can be set globally at server startup by using options on the cmd line or in an option file.
# When you use a startup option to set a variable that takes numerical, it can have suffix of one of the following:
#
# 		K - 1024  (kb)
# 		M - 1024^2 (mb)
# 		G - 1024^3 (gb)
# 		T - 1024^4 (tb)
# 		P - 1024^5
# 		E - 1024^6
#
# The following commands starts the server with an InnoDB log file size of 16 MB and a max pack size of 1 GB:
#
# 		mysqld --innodb_log_file_size=16M --max_allowed_packet=1G
#
# Within an option file, they are set as:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		innodb_log_file_size=16M
# 		max_allowed_packet=1G
#
# Case insensitive.
#
# To restrict the maximum value to which a system variable can be set at runtime with the SET
# statement, specify this maximum by using an option of the form --maximum-<var_name>=<value> at server startup.
#
# For example, to prevent the value of innodb_log_file_size from being increased to more than 32MB
# at runtime, use the option --maximum-innodb_log_file_size=32M.
#
# Many sys vars are dynamic and can be changed at runtime by using the SET statement.
# To change a sys var with SET, refer to it by name, optionally preceded by a modifier.
#
# A global sys_var:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL max_connections = 1000;
# 		SET @@global.max_connections = 1000;
#
# Persist a global sys var to the mysqld-auto.cnf file (and set the runtime value):
#
# 		SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
# 		SET @@persist.max_connections = 1000;
#
# Persist a global system variable to the mysqld-auto.cnf file (without setting the runtime value):
#
# 		SET PERSIST_ONLY back_log = 1000;
# 		SET @@persist_only.back_log = 1000;
#
# Set a session system variable:
#
# 		SET SESSION sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
# 		SET @@session.sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
# 		SET @@sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
#
# Later on, a full showcasing of SET syntax is showcased.
#
# Suffixes for specifying a value multiplier can be used when setting a variable at server startup,
# but not to set the value with SET at runtime.
#
# On the other hand, with SET you can assign a variable's value using an expression, which is not true
# when you set a variable at server startup.
#
# For example, the first of the following line is legal at server startup - but the second is not:
#
# mysql --max_allowed_packet=16M #Legal at server startup
# mysql --max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024 #Illegal at server startup
#
# Conversely, for SET, second is legal at runtime - first is not:
#
# SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16M;#
# SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024;
#
# NOTE: Some system vars can be enabled with SET by setting them to ON/1 or OFF/0.
# 		  To set it on the cmd line or in an option file - Must be set to 1 or 0.
#
# To display system variable names and values; use the SHOW_VARIABLES statement:

# With a LIKE clause, the statement displays only those variables that match the pattern.
# To obtain a specific variable name, use a LIKE clause as follows:
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';
# 		SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';
#
# To get a list of variables whose name match a pattern, use % Wildchar regex matching in a LIKE clause:
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%size%';
# 		SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE '%size%';
#
# Wildcard chars can be used in any pos within the pattern to be matched.
# Stricly speaking, because _ is a wildcard char - you ought to escape it as \_
#
# For SHOW_VARIABLES, if you specify neither GLOBAL nor SESSION, MYSQL returns SESSION values.
#
# The reason for requiring the GLOBAL keyword when setting GLOBAL only vars but not when retrieving them
# is to prevent problems in the future:
#
# 		Were a SESSION var to be removed that has the same name as a GLOBAL var, a client with privs sufficient
# 		to modify global vars might accidentally change the GLOBAL variable rather than just the SESSION var for its own session.
#
# 		Were a SESSION variable to be added with the same name as a GLOBAL variable, a client that intends to change
# 		the GLOBAL variable might find only its own SESSION var changed.
#
# The following covers System Variable Privs:
#
# A system variable can have a global value that affects server operations as a whole, a session value that affects the
# the current session or both.
#
# Many SYS_VAR are dynamic and can be changed at runtime using the SET statement to affect operation of the current
# server instance.
#
# SET can also be used to persist certain global SYS_VAR to the mysqld-auto.cnf file in the data dir,
# to affect server operation for subsequent startups.
#
# RESET_PERSIST removes persisted settings from mysqld-auto.cnf
#
# This section pertains to setting privs required to assign values to SYS_VARs at runtime.
#
# This includes persistence-related privs because some statements that modify sys_var values
# persist those settings to the mysqld-auto.cnf file.
#
# These privs apply to setting global SYS_VAR values:
#
# 		To set a global SYS_VAR at runtime, use the SET_GLOBAL statement, which requires the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER priv.
#
# 		To persist a global system var to the mysqld-auto.cnf (and set the runtime value), use the SET_PERSIST statement,
# 		which requires the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.
#
# 		To persist a global system var to the mysqld-auto.cnf (WITHOUT setting runtime), use the SET_PERSIST_ONLY statement,
# 		which requires the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and PERSIST_RO_VARIABLES_ADMIN privs.
#
# 		To remove a persisted global sys_var from the mysqld-auto.cnf file, use the RESET_PERSIST statement:
# 
# 			For dynamic sys_vars, this statement requires the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.
#
# 			For read-only sys_vars, this statement requires the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and PERSIST_RO_VARIABLES_ADMIN privs.
#
# The descriptions for individual SYS_VARs indicate any exceptions to the preceding priv requirements. An example is mandatory_roles.
#
# To set a session sys_var at runtime, use the SET_SESSION statement. In contrast to global sys_vars, setting session sys_vars at runtime
# normally requires no special privs and can be done by any user to affect the current session.
#
# However, for some sys_vars, setting the session values can have effects outside the current session and thus is a restricted
# ops, requiring privs:
#
# (MySQL 8.0.14 >=) - the priv required is SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN. However, any user who has SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER effectively
# 							 has SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN by implication and need not be granted SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN explicitly.
#
# (< 8.0.14 MysQL)  - The priv is SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER.
#
# If a session sys_var is restricted, the var desc. indicates that restriction. Examples include binlog_format, sql_log_bin and sql_log_off
#
# The reason for restricting certain session sys_vars is that changing them can have effects beyond the current session.
#
# For example, setting the session binlog_format or sql_log_bin values affects binary logging for the current session,
# but that may have implications for the integrity of server replication and backups.
#
# SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN enables admins to minimize the priv footprint of users who may previously have been granted
# SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER for the purpose of enabling them to modify restricted session sys_vars.
#
# Assume that a admin has created the following role to confer the ability to set restricted session Sys_var:
#
# 		CREATE ROLE set_session_sysvars;
# 		GRANT SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN ON *.* TO set_session_sysvars;
#
# Any user granted the set_session_sysvars role (and who has that role active) is able to set restricted session sys_vars.
# However, that user is also able to set global sys_vars - which may be undesirable.
#
# By modifying the role to have SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN instead of SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, the role privs can be
# reduced to the ability to set restricted session sys_vars and nothing else.
#
# i.e:
#
# GRANT SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN ON *.* TO set_session_sysvars;
# REVOKE SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN ON *.* FROM set_session_sysvars;
#
# Modifying the role has an immediate effect. 
#
# Any account granted the set_session_sysvars role no longer has SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and is not able to set
# global sys_vars without explicit grants.
#
# A similar GRANT/REVOKE sequence can be applied to any account that was granted SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN
# directly rather than by means of a role.
#
# The following pertains to Dynamic Sys_Vars:
#
# Many server vars are dynamic and can be set at runtime.

#
# The following pertains to Persisted System Variables:
#
# The MySQL server maintains sys vars that configure its operations. A sys var can have a global value that
# effects server ops as a whole, current session or both.
#
# Many sys vars are dynamic, can be changed during runtime using SET to affect current session.
# SET can also be used to persist certain global sys vars to the mysqld-auto.cnf in the data dir - which affects subsequent startups.
#
# RESET_PERSIST removes persisted settings from mysqld-auto.cnf
#
# The following pertains to a OVERVIEW of the persisted Sys vars:
#
# Many sys_vars can be set at startup from a my.cnf option file or at runtime using the SET
# statement, those methods of configing the server either requires a login access to the server host,
# or do not provide the capability of persistently configuring the server at runtime or remotely:
#
# 		Modifying an option file requires direct access to that file, which requires login access to the MySQL server host.
#
# 		MOdifying sys_vars with SET_GLOBAL is a runtime capability that can be done from clients run locally 
# 		or from remote hosts, but the changes affect only the current running server instance. i.e, nont persistent.
#
# To persist sys_vars to a file named mysqld-auto.cnf - in the data dir - we can do as follows:
#
# 		SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
# 		SET @@persist.max_connections = 1000;
#
# 		SET PERSIST ONLY back_log = 100;
# 		SET @@persist_only.back_log = 100;
#
# MySQL also provides a RESET PERSIST statement for removing persisted sys vars from mysqld-auto.cnf
#
# Server configs performed by persisted sys_vars, has these chareteristics:
#
# 		Made at runtime
#
# 		Permanent, apply across server restarts
#
# 		Can be made from local or clients who connect from a remote host.
# 		(can configure multiple remote MySQL servers from a central client host)
#
# 		To persist sys_vars only reqs the privs for it, not login access or akin.
#
# 		Admin rights allows you to reconfig servers by persisting sys_vars, then cause the 
# 		server to use the changed settings by executing a RESTART statement.
#
# 		Persisted settings provide immediate feedback about errors, because if you try to SET 
# 		a malformed setting or syntax error - it does not change the server config, due to failing.
#
# The following pertains to the SYNTAX for persisting Sys_Vars:
#
# 		To persist a global sys_var to mysqld-auto.cnf option file in the data dir, we can use PERSIST Or the @@persist qualifier:
#
# 			SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
# 			SET @@persist.max_connections = 1000;
#
# 			Like SET_GLOBAL, SET_PERSIST sets the global var runtime - but also writes the var setting to mysqld-auto.cnf 
# 			(replaces existing var settings if they are there)
#
# 		To persist a global sys var to the mysqld-auto.cnf without setting the global var runtime value - we can use PERSIST_ONLY or @@persist_only.back_log
#
# 			SET PERSIST_ONLY back_log = 1000;
# 			SET @@persist_only.back_log = 1000;
#
# 			(Writes to the mysqld-auto.cnf file - but does not modify the global var runtime value)
# 			(Suitable for configing read_only sys_vars that can only be done at server startup)
#
# These RESET_PERSIST syntax ops can be used for removing persisted sys_vars:
#
# 		To remove all persisted vars from mysqld-auto.cnf, use RESET_PERSIST without naming any sys var:
# 			
# 			RESET PERSIST;
#
# 		To remove a specified persisted var from mysqld-auto.cnf, name it in the statement:
#
# 			RESET PERSIST system_var_name;
#
# 		To remove a specific persisted var from mysqld-auto.cnf, but produce a warning rather than an error
# 		if the var is not present in the file, we can do IF EXISTS:
#
# 			RESET PERSIST IF EXISTS system_var_name;
#
#
# A sys_var implemented by a plugin can be persisted if the plugin is installed when the SET statement is executed.
# Assignment of the persisted plugin variable takes effect for subsequent server restarts if the plugin is still installed.
#
# If the plugin is no longer installed, the plugin variable will not exist when the server reads the mysqld-auto.cnf file
# The server writes a warning to the error log and continues:
#
# 		currently unknown variable '<var_name>'
# 		was read from the persisted config file
#
# The following pertains to obtaining information About Persisted Sys Vars:
#
# 		The Performance Schema <persisted_variables> table provides an SQL interface to the mysqld-auto.cnf file, enabling its
# 		contents to be inspected at runtime using SELECT statements.
#
# 		The Performance Schema <variables_info> table contains info showing when and by which user each sys_var was most recently set.
#
# 		RESET_PERSIST affects the contents of the persisted_variables table because the table contents correspond to the contents
# 		of the mysqld-auto.cnf file.
#
# 		On the other hand, because RESET_PERSIST does not change variable values, it has no effect on the contents of the variables_info
# 		table until the server is restarted.
#
# The following pertains to FORMAT AND SERVER HANDLING OF THE MYSQLD-AUTO.CNF FILE:
#
# It's akin to JSON:
#
# {
# 		"Version": 1,
# 		"mysql_server": {
# 			"max_connections": {
# 				"Value": 	"152",
# 				"Metadata": {
# 					"Timestamp": 1.51.. (etc.)
# 					"User": 	"root",
# 					"Host": 	"localhost"
# 				}
# 		},
# 		"transaction_isolation": {
# 			"Value": "READ-COMMITTED",
# 			"Metadata": {
# 				"Timestamp": 1.51.. (etc)
# 				"User": "root",
# 				"Host": "localhost"
# 			}
# 		},
# 		"mysql_server_static_options": {
# 			"innodb_api_enable_mdi": {
# 				"Value": "0",
# 				"Metadata": {
# 					"Timestamp": 1.51.. (etc)
# 					"User": "root",
# 					"Host": "localhost"
# 				}
# 			},
# 			"log_slave_updates": {
# 				"Values": "1",
# 				"Metadata": {
# 					"Timestamp": 1.51... (etc)
# 					"User": "root",
# 					"Host": "localhost"
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}	
#}
#
# At startup the server processes the mysqld-auto.cnf file after all other option files.
# The server handles the file contents as follows:
#
# 		If the persisted_globals_load sys_var is disabled, the server ignores the mysqld-auto.cnf file.
#
# 		Only read-only variables persisted using SET_PERSIST_ONLY appear in the "mysql_server_static_options" section.
# 		All variables present inside this section are appended to the cmd line and processed with other cmd line options.
#
# 		All remaining persisted variables are set by executing the equivalent of a SET_GLOBAL statement later, just before
# 		the server starts listening for client connections.
#
# 		These settings therefore do not take effect until late in the startup process, which might be unsuitable for certain
# 		sys_vars.
#
# 		For example, a variable such as log_error_verbosity that affects logging to the error log takes effect later in the 
# 		startup process if persisted to mysqld-auto.cnf than if set in my.cnf. It may be preferable to set such variables
# 		in my.cnf rather than in mysqld-auto.cnf
#
# Management of the mysqld-auto.cnf file should be left to the server. Manipulation of it should only occur through SET and RESET_PERSIST statements.
#
# Removing the file, causes loss of all persisted settings at hte next server startup.
#
# Manual changes to the file may result in a parse error at server startup.
# In this case, the server reports an error and exits.
#
# If said issue occurs, start the server with the persisted_globals_load sys_var disabled,
# or with the --no-defaults option.
#
# Or remove mysqld-auto.cnf.
#
# The following pertains to nonpersistent Sys_vars:
#
# SET_PERSIST and SET_PERSIST_ONLY enable Global sys_vars to be persisted to the mysqld-auto.cnf option file in the data dir.
# However, not all sys_vars can be persisted.
#
# Might be prevented from being persisted by virtue of:
#
# 		A sys var might be read only. Cannot be set at all, whether at server startup or at runtime.
#
# 		A sys var might be intended only for internal use.
#
# 		A sys var might involve sensitive data. A variable such as secure_file_priv should be settable
# 		only by a user who has direct access to the server host file system - not a remote user. (Due to possible priv escalation)
#
# 		Session sys_vars cannot be persisted. Cannot be set at server startup, so cannot be persisted (no reason)
#
# The following are sys_vars of which cannot be persisted:

# The following pertains to structured system variables:
#
# A structured Sys_var differs from a regular sys_var in two respects:
#
# 		Its value is a structure with components that specify server parameters considered to be closely related.
#
# 		There might be several instances of a given type of structured variable. Each one has a different name and refers to
# 		a different resource maintained by the server.
#
# MySQL supports one structured variable type, which specifies parameters governing the operation of key caches.
# A key cached structured variable has these components:
#
# 		key_buffer_size
#
# 		key_cache_block_size
#
# 		key_cache_division_limit
#
# 		key_cache_age_threshold
#
# This section describes the syntax for referring to the structured vars. Key cache variables are for examples, their interactions are covered later.
#
# To refer to a component of a structured variable instance, you can use a compound name in instance_name.component_name format, example:
#
# 		hot_cache.key_buffer_size
# 		hot_cache.key_cache_block_size
# 		cold_cache.key_cache_block_size
#
# For each structured sys_var, an instance with the name of <default> is always predefined.
# If you refer to a component of a structured var without any instance name, the <default> instance is used.
#
# Thus, default.key_buffer_size and key_buffer_size refer to the same sys_var.
#
# Structured var instances and components follows these naming rules:
#
# 		For a given type of structured variable, each instance must have a name that is unique within variables of that type.
# 		However, instance names need not be unique across structured variable types.
#
# 		For example, each structured variable has an instance named default, so default is not unique across variable types.
#
# 		The names of the components of each structured variable type must be unique across all sys_var names.
#
# 		If this were not true (that is, two different types of structured vars could share component member names),
# 		it would not be clear which default structured variable to use for references to member names that are not qualified
# 		by an instance name.
#
# 		If a structured variable instance name is not legal as an unquoted identifier, refer to it as a quoted identifier
# 		using backticks. For example, hot-cache is not legal - but `hot-cache` is.
#
# 		global, session and local are not legal instance names. This vaoids a conflict with notations such as @@global.<var_name>
# 		for referring to nonstructured sys_vars.
#
# Currently, the first two rules have no possibility of being violated because the only structured variable type is the one
# for key caches. These rules will assume greater significance if some other type of structured variable is created in the future.
#
# With one exception, you can refer to structured variable components using compound names in any context where simple var names 
# can occur.
#
# For example, you can assign a value to a structured var using a cmd line option:
#
# 		mysqld --hot_cache.key_buffer_size=64K
#
# In a option file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		hot_cache.key_buffer_size=64K
#
# The above entails a key cache named hot_cache with a size of 64KB in addition to the default of 8MB.
#
# We could also do as follows:
#
# 		mysqld --key_buffer_size=256K \
# 			--extra_cache.key_buffer_size=128K \
# 			--extra_cache.key_cache_block_size=2048
#
# In this case, the server sets the size of the default key cache to 256KB. 
# (we could also have written --default.key_buffer_size=256K). 
#
# In addition, we create a second cache named extra_cache that has a size of 128K, with size of
# block buffers for caching table index blocks set to 2048 bytes.
#
# THe following example starts the server with three different key caches having sizes in a 3:1:1 ratio:
#
# 	mysqld --key_buffer_size=6M \
# 		--hot_cache.key_buffer_size=2M \
# 		--cold_cache.key_buffer_size=2M
#
# Structured var vlaues may be set and retrieved at runtime as well. For example, to set a key cache named hot_cache
# to a size of 10MB, use either of:
#
# SET GLOBAL hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 10*1024*1024;
# SET @@global.hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 10*1024*1024;
#
# To retrieve the cache size, do this:
#
# SELECT @@global.hot_cache.key_buffer_size;
#
# However, using:
#
# SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'hot_cache.key_buffer_size'; 
#
# Would not work, as it would be considered a string match for LIKE regex ops of a simple variable naming.
#
# 
# The following section pertains to Server Status Variables:
#
# The MySQL server maintains many status variables that provide information about its operation.
# You can view these vars and their values by using the SHOW [GLOBAL | SESSION] STATUS statement.
#
# The optional GLOBAL keyword aggregates the values over all connections, and SESSION shows for the current connection.
#
# SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;
#
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | Variable_name 						| 	Value 		 |
# +---------------------------------+---------------+
# | 											| 					 |
# | Aborted_clients 						| 0 				 |
# | Aborted_connects 					| 0 				 |
# | Bytes_received 						| 155372598 	 |

# +---------------------------------+---------------+
#
# Several status vars provide statement counts. To determine the amount of statements executed, use:
#
# SUM(Com_xxx)
# = Questions + statements executed within stored programs
# = Queries
#
# Many status variables are reset to 0 by the FLUSH_STATUS statement.
#
# The status variables have the following meanings:
#
# 		Aborted_clients
#
# 			Number of connections that were aborted because the client died without closing the connection properly.
#
# 		Aborted_connects
#
# 			The number of failed attempts to connect to the MySQL server.
#
# 			For additional connection-related info, check the Connection_errors_xxx status vars and the host_cache table.
#
# 		Binlog_cache_disk_use
#
# 			Number of transactions that used the temporary binary log cache but that exceeded the value of binlog_cache_size
# 			and used a temporary file to store statements from the transaction.
#
# 			The number of nontransactional statements that caused the binary log transaction cache to be written to disk
# 			is tracked separately in the Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use status variable.
#
# 		Acl_cache_items_count
#
# 			Number of cached privlege objects. Each object is the privlege combination of a user and its active roles.
#
# 		Binlog_cache_use
#
# 			Number of transactions that used the binary log cache.
#
# 		Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use
#
# 			Number of nontransaction statements that used the binary log statement cache but that exceeded
# 			the value of of binlog_stmt_cache_size and used a temporary file to store those statements.
#
# 		Binlog_stmt_cache_use
#
# 			Number of nontransactional statements, that used the binary log statement cache.
#
# 		Bytes_received
#
# 			Number of bytes received from all clients.
#
# 		Bytes_sent
#
# 			Number of bytes sent to all clients.
#
# 		Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key
#
# 			Public key used by the caching_sha2_password authentication plugin for RSA key-pair based PW exchange.
#
# 			The value is nonempty only if the server successfully intiializes the private and public keys in the
# 			files named by the caching_sha2_password_private_key_path and caching_sha2_password_public_key_path SYS_VARS.
#
# 			The value of Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key comes from the latter file.
#
# 		Com_xxx
#
# 			The Com_xxx statement counter variables indicate the number of times each xxx statement has been executed.
#
# 			There is one status variable for each type of statement.
# 			For example, Com_delete and Com_update count DELETE and UPDATE statements, respectively.
#
# 			Com_delete_multi and Com_update_multi are similar but apply to DELETE and UPDATE statements that use multiple-table syntax.
#
# 			All of the Com_stmt_xxx variables are increased even if a prepared statement argument is unknown or an error occured
# 			during execution. In other words, their values correspond to the number of requests issued - not the number of requests successfully completed.
#
# 			The Com_stmt_xxx status variables are as follows:
#
# 				Com_stmt_prepare
#
# 				Com_stmt_execute
#
# 				Com_stmt_fetch
#
# 				Com_stmt_send_long_data
#
# 				Com_stmt_reset
#
# 				Com_stmt_close
#
# 			Those variables stand for prepared statement commands. Their names refer to the COM_xxx command set used
# 			in the network layer.
#
# 			In other words, their values increase whenever prepared statement API calls such as mysql_stmt_prepare(),
# 			mysql_stmt_execute() and so forth are executed.
#
# 			However, Com_stmt_prepare, Com_stmt_execute and Com_stmt_close also increase for PREPARE, EXECUTE or DEALLOCATE_PREPARE,
# 			respectively.
#
# 			Additionally, the values of the older statement counter variables Com_prepare_sql, Com_execute_sql and Com_dealloc_sql
# 			increase for the PREPARE, EXECUTE and DEALLOCATE_PREPARE statements.
#
# 			Com_stmt_fetch stands for the total number of network round-trips issued when fetching from cursors.
#
# 			Com_stmt_reprepare indicates the number of times statements were automatically reprepared by the server after
# 			metadata changes to tables or views referred to by the statement.
#
# 			A reprepare operation increments Com_stmt_reprepare and also Com_stmt_prepare.
#
# 			Com_explain_other indicates the number of EXPLAIN_FOR_CONNECTION statements executed.
#
# 			Com_change_repl_filter indicates the number of CHANGE_REPLICATION_FILTER statements executed.
#
# 		Compression
#
# 			Whether the client connection uses compression in the client/server protocol.
#
# 		Connection_errors_xxx
#
# 			These variables provide info about errors that occur during the client connection process.
#
# 			They are global only and represent error counts aggregated across connections from all hosts.
#
# 			These variable track errors not accounted for by the host cache - such as errors that are not
# 			associated with TCP connections, occur very early in the connection process (even before an IP address is known),
# 			or are not specific to any particular IP address (such as out of memory conditions).
#
# 				Connection_errors_accept
#
# 					The number of errors that occurred during calls to accept() on the listening port.
#
# 				Connection_errors_internal
#
# 					The number of connections refused due to internal errors in the server, such as failure to start
# 					a new thread or an out-of-memory condition.
#
# 				Connection_errors_max_connections
#
# 					Number of connections refused because the server max_connections limit was reached.
#
# 				Connection_errors_peer_address
#
# 					The number of errors that occurred while searching for connecting clientIP addresses.
#
# 				Connection_errors_select
#
# 					Number of errors that occured during calls to select() or poll() on the listening port.
# 					(Failure of this operation does not necessarily mean a client connection was rejected)
#
# 				Connection_errors_tcpwrap
#
# 					The number of connections refused by the libwrap library.
#
# 		Connections - Number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the MySQL server.
#
# 		Created_tmp_disk_tables
#
# 			Number of internal on-disk temporary tables created by the server while executing statements.
#
# 			If an internal temp table is created initially as an in-memory table but becomes too large, MySQL automatically
# 			converts it to an on-disk table.
#
# 			The max size for in-memory temp tables is the minimum of the tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size values.
#
# 			If Created_tmp_disk_tables is large, you may want to increase the tmp_table_size or max_heap_table_size value
# 			to lessen the likelihood that internal temp tables in memory will be converted to on-disk tables.
#
# 			You can compare the number of internal on-disk temp tables created to the total number of internal temp tables
# 			created by comparing the values of the Created_tmp_disk_tables and Created_tmp_tables variables.
#
# 		Created_tmp_files
#
# 			How many temporary files mysqld has created.
#
# 		Created_tmp_tables
#
# 			Number of internal temporary tables created by the server while executing statements.
#
# 			You can compare the number of internal-on-disk temp tables created to the total number of internal
# 			temp tables created by comparing the values of the Created_tmp_disk_tables and Created_tmp_tables vars.
#
# 			Each invocation of the SHOW_STATUS statement uses an internal temp table and increment the global Created_tmp_tables value.
#
# 		Delayed_errors
#
# 			This status variable is DEPRECATED (delayed is not supported)
#
# 		Delayed_insert_threads, Delayed_writes - Deprecated.
#
# 		dragnet.Status 
#
# 			The result of the most recent assignment to the dragnet.log_error_filter_rules SYS_VAR, empty if no such assignment has occurred.
#
# 		Flush_commands
#
# 			Number of times the server flushes tables, whether because a user executed a FLUSH_TABLES statement or due to internal 
# 			server operation.
#
# 			It is also incremented by receipt of a COM_REFRESH packet. This is in contrast to Com_flush, which indicates how many
# 			FLUSH statements have been executed, whether FLUSH_TABLES, FLUSH_LOGS etc.
#
# 		group_replication_primary_member
#
# 			Shows the primary member's UUID when the group is operating in single-primary mode.
# 			If the group is operating multi-primary mode, shows an empty string.
#
# 			The group_replication_primary_member status variable is deprecated.
#
# 		Handler_commit
#
# 			Number of internal COMMIT statements.
#
# 		Handler_delete
#
# 			Number of times that rows have been deleted from tables.
#
# 		Handler_external_lock
#
# 			The server increments this variable for each call to its external_lock() function, which generally occurs at the
# 			beginning and end of access to a table instance.
#
# 			There might be differences amongst storage engines. This variable can be used, for example, to discover for a statement
# 			that accesses a partitioned table how many partitions were pruned before locking occurred:
#
# 			Check how much the counter increased for the statement, subtract 2 (2 calls for the table itself), then /2 to get number of
# 			partitions locked.
#
# 		Handler_mrr_init
#
# 			Number of times the server uses a storage engine's own Multi-Range Read implementation for table access.
#
# 		Handler_prepare
#
# 			A counter for the prepare phase of two-phase commit operations.
#
# 		Handler_read_first
#
# 			Number of times the first entry in an index was read. If this value is high, it suggests that the server
# 			is doing a lot of full index scans; for example, SELECT col1 FROM foo - assuming that col1 is indexed.
#
# 		Handler_read_key
#
# 			Number of requests to read a row based on a key. If this value is high, it is a good indication that your tables 
# 			are properly indexed for your queries.
#
# 		Handler_read_last
#
# 			The number of requests to read the last key in an index. 
#
# 			With ORDER BY, the server will issue a first-key request followed by several next-key requests,
# 			whereas with ORDER BY DESC, the server will issue a last-key request followed by several previous-key requests.
#
# 		Handler_read_next
#
# 			The number of requests to read the next row in key order. This value is incremented if you are querying an index column with
# 			a range constraint or if you are doing an index scan.
#
# 		Handler_read_prev
#
# 			The number of requests to read the previous row in key order. This read method is mainly used to optimize ORDER BY ... DESC
#
# 		Handler_read_rnd
#
# 			Number of requests to read a row based on a fixed position. 
#
# 			This value is high if you are doing a lot of queries that require sorting of the result.
# 		   You probably have a lot of queries that require MySQL to scan entire tables or you have joins that do not use keys properly.
#
# 		Handler_read_rnd_next
#
# 			The number of requests to read the next row in the data file.
#
# 			This value is high if you are doing a lot of table scans. 
#
# 			Generally this suggests that your tables are not properly indexed or that your queries
# 			are not written to take advantage of the indexes you have.
#
# 		Handler_rollback
#
# 			Number of requests for a storage engine to perform a rollback operation.
#
# 		Handler_savepoint
#
# 			Number of requests for a storage engine to place a savepoint.
#
# 		Handler_savepoint_rollback
#
# 			The number of requests for a storage engine to roll back to a savepoint.

# 			Number of requests to update a row in a table.
#
# 		Handler_write
#
# 			Number of requests to insert a row in a table.
#
# 		Innodb_available_undo_logs
#
# 			Innodb_available_undo_logs was removed in MySQL 8.0.2.

# 			If the operation introduces too much overhead, you can cancel it by setting innodb_buffer_pool_load_abort
#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_data
#
# 			The total number of bytes in the InnoDB buffer pool containing data.
#
# 			The number includes borth dirty and clean pages.
#
# 			For more accurate memory usage calculations than with Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data,

#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data
#
# 			The number of pages in the InnoDB buffer pool containing data. The number includes both dirty and clean pages.

#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_dirty
#
# 			The total current number of bytes held in dirty pages in the InnoDB buffer pool.

#
# 			Calculation of this variable is expensive, so it is available only when the UNIV_DEBUG system is defined at server build time.
#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_misc
#
# 			The number of pages in the InnoDB buffer pool that are busy because they have been allocated for admin overhead,
# 			such as row locks or the adaptive hash index.
#
# 			This value can also be calculated as Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_total - Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_free - Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data.
#
# 			When using compressed tables, Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_misc may report an out-of-bounds value (Bug #59550)
#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_total
#
# 			The total size of the InnoDB buffer pool, in pages.

# 			subsequently evicted without having been accessed by queries.
#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead_rnd
#
# 			The number of "random" read-aheads initated by InnoDB.

#
# 			The number of logical read requests.
#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_reads
#
# 			The number of logical reads that InnoDB could not satisfy from the buffer pool, and had to read directly
# 			from disk.
#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status
#
# 			The status of an operation to resize the InnoDB buffer pool dynamically triggered by setting the innodb_buffer_pool_size param dynamically.
#
# 			The innodb_buffer_pool_size parameter is dynamic, which allows you to resize the buffer pool without restarting the server.
#
# 		Innodb_buffer_pool_wait_free
#
# 			Normally, writes to the InnoDB buffer pool happen in the background.
#
# 			When InnoDB needs to read or create a page and no clean pages are available, InnoDB flushes
# 			some dirty pages first and waits for that ops. to finish.
#
# 			This counter counts instances of these waits. If innodb_buffer_pool_size has been set properly,
# 			this value should be small.

#
# 			If the product of Tc_log_max_pages_used and Tc_log_page_size is always significantly less than the log size, the size is larger
# 			than necessary and can be reduced.
#
# 			(The size is set by the --log-tc-size option)
#
# 			This variable is unused, it is unneeded for binary log-based recovery, and the memory-mapped recovery log
# 			method is not used unless the number of storage engines that are capable of two-phase commit and that 
# 			supports XA transactions is greater than one.
#
# 			(InnoDB is the only one)
#

# 		Tc_log_page_waits
#
# 			For the memory-mapped implementation of the recovery log, this variable increments each time the server
# 			was not able to commit a transaction and had to wait for a free page in the log.
#
# 			If this value is large, might want to increase the log size (with the --log-tc-size option).
#
# 			For binary log-based recovery, this variable increments each time the binary log cannot be closed because
# 			there are two-phase commits in progress.
#
# 			(The close operation waits until all such transactions are finished)

#
# The following section covers the interactions of Server SQL Modes:
#
# The MySQL server can operate in different SQL modes, and can apply these modes differently for different clients,
# depending on the value of the sql_mode SYS_VAR.
#
# DBAs can set the global SQL mode to match site server OS reqs, and each application can set its session SQL mode to its own
# requirements.
#
# Modes affect the SQL syntax MySQL supports and the data validation checks it performs.
# This makes it easier to use MySQL in different envs and to use MySQL together with other DB servers.
#
# When working with InnoDB - we have to keep innodb_strict_mode SYS_VAR. It enables additional error checks for InnoDB tables.
#
#
#
#
#
# The following section pertains to Setting the SQL Mode:
#
# The default SQL mode in MySQL 8.0 includes these modes:
#
# 		ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
# 		STRICT_TRANS_TABLES
# 		NO_ZERO_IN_DATE
# 		NO_ZERO_DATE
# 		ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO
# 		NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
#
# To set the SQL mode at server startup, use the --sql-mode="modes" option on the cmd line,
# or sql-mode="modes" in an option file such as my.cnf (Unix OS's) or my.ini (Windows).
#
# modes is a list of different modes separated by commas. 
#
# To clear the SQL mode explicitly, set it to an empty string using --sql-mode="" on
# the cmd line, or sql-mode="" in an option file.
#
# Note: MySQL installation programs may configure the SQL mode during the install process.
# 			
# 		  If the SQL mode differs from the default or from what you expect, check for a setting.
#
# To set at runtime:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'modes';
# 		SET SESSION sql_mode = 'modes';
#
# Setting the GLOBAL variable requires the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER privs and affects the operation
# of all clients that connect from that time on.
#
# Setting the SESSION variable affects only the current client.
#
# Each client can change its session sql_mode value at any time.
#
# To determine the current value:
#
# SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;
# SELECT @@SESSION.sql_mode;
#
# NOTE: 	SQL mode and user-defined partitioning 
#
# 			Changing the server SQL mode after creating and inserting data into partitioned tables can cause major
# 			changes in the behavior of such tables, and could lead to loss or corruption of data.
#
# 			It is strongly recommended that you never change the SQL mode once you have created tables
# 			employing user-defined partitioning.
#
# 			When replicating partitioned tables, differing SQL modes on the master and slave can also lead to
# 			problems.
#
# 			For best results, you should always use the same server SQL mode on the master and slave.
#
# The most important sql_mode values are probably these:
#
# 		ANSI - This mode changes syntax and behavior to conform more closely to standard SQL.
#
# 		STRICT_TRANS_TABLES - If a value could not be inserted as given into a transactional table, abort the statement.
#
# 									 For a nontransactional table, abort the statement if the value occurs in a single-row statement
# 									 or the first row of a multiple-row statement.
#
# 		TRADITIONAL - Make MySQL behave like a "traditional" SQL DB system. Give an error instead of a warning when inserting a incorrect
# 						  value into a column.
#
# 						  NOTE - With TRADITIONAL mode enabled, an INSERT or UPDATE aborts as soon as an error occurs.
#
# 									If you are using a nontransactional storage engine, this may not be what you want because
# 									data changes made prior to the error may not be rolled back, resulting in a "partiall done" update.
#
# "strict mode" here - will refer to STRICT_TRANS_TABLES/STRICT_ALL_TABLES enabled.
#
# The following covers all supported SQL modes:
#
# ALLOW_INVALID_DATES - Do not perform full checking of dates. Check only that the month is in the range from 1 to 12 and that the
# 								day is in the range from 1 to 31.
#
# 								This may be useful for Web applications that obtain year, month and day in three different fields and 
# 								store exactly what the user inserted, without date validation.
#
# 								This mode applies to DATE and DATETIME columns.
# 								It does not apply TIMESTAMP columns, which always require a valid date.
#
# 								With ALLOW_INVALID_DATES enabled, the server requires that month and day values be legal,
# 								and not merely in the range 1 to 12 and 1 to 31.
#
# 								With strict disabled, invalid dates such as '2004-04-31' are converted to '0000-00-00'
# 								and a warning is generated.
#
# 								With strict mode enabled, invalid dates generate an error. To permit it, enable ALLOW_INVALID_DATES.
#
# ANSI_QUOTES - 			Treat " as an identifier quote char (like `) and not as a string quote char.
#
# 								You can still use `to quote identifiers with this mode enabled.
#
# 								With ANSI_QUOTES enabled, you cannot use double quotation marks to quote literal strings
# 								because they are interpreted as identifiers.
#
# ERROR_FOR_DIVISION 	The ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO mode affects handling of division by zero, which includes MOD(N, 0).
# _BY_ZERO  				
# 								For data-change operations (INSERT,UPDATE) - its effect also depends on whether strict SQL mode is enabled.
#
# 									If this mode is not enabled, division by 0 inserts NULL and produces no warning.
#
# 									If this mode is enabled, division by 0 inserts NULL and produces a warning.
#
# 									If this mode and strict mode are enabled, division by zero produces an error, unless IGNORE is given as well.
# 									For INSERT IGNORE and UPDATE IGNORE, division by zero inserts NULL and produces a warning.
#
# 								For SELECT, division by zero returns NULL. 
#
# 								Enabling ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO causes a warning to be produced as well, regardless of whether strict mode is enabled.
# 							
# 								ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO is deprecated. Not part of strict mode, should be used with Strict, on by default.
# 								Causes error if used without strict, and vice versa.
#
# HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE 	The precedence of the NOT operator is such that expressions such as NOT a BETWEEN b AND c are parsed as NOT (a BETWEEN b AND c).
#
# 								In some older versions of MySQL, the expression was parsed as (NOT a) BETWEEN b AND c.
#
# 								The old higher-precedence behavior can be obtained by enabling the HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE SQL mode.
#
# 								SET sql_mode = '';
# 								SELECT NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5; #Gives 0 (False), because 1 is between -5 and 5 (1, True), to which inverse of NOT is (0, False)
#
# 								SET sql_mode = 'HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE';
# 								SELECT NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5; #Gives 1 (True), because inversing the result, due to higher not precedence of operator
#
# IGNORE_SPACE 			Permit spaces between a function name and the ( char.
# 								This causes built-in function names to be treated as reserved words.
#
# 								As a result, identifiers that are the same as function names must be quoted.
#
# 								An example, because there is COUNT(), the use of count as a table name, causes an error:
#
# 									CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
# 									ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax
#
# 								The table name should be quoted:
#
# 									CREATE TABLE `count` (i INT);
# 									Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 								The IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to user-defined functions or stored functions.
#
# 								It is always permissible to have spaces after a UDF or stored function name, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.
#
# NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO Affects handling of AUTO_INCREMENT columns.
#
# 								Normally, you generate the next sequence number for the column by inserting either NULL or 0
# 								into it. NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO suppresses this behavior for 0 so that only NULL generates the
# 								next sequence number.
#
# 								This mode can be useful if 0 has been stored in a tables AUTO_INCREMENT column.
# 								(Storing 0 is not a recommended practice, by the way)
#
# 								For example, if you dump the table with mysqldump and then reload it, MySQL
# 								normally generates new sequence numbers when it encounters the 0 value, resulting
# 								in a table with contents different from the one that was dumped.
#
# 								Enabling NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO before reloading the dump file solves this problem.
#
# 								For this reason, mysqldump automatically includes in its output a statement that enables
# 								NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO
#
# NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES 	Disables the use of the \ char as an escape char within strings. With this mode enabled, \ becomes an ordinary char like any other.
#
# NO_DIR_IN_CREATE 		When creating a table, ignore all INDEX DIRECTORY and DATA DIRECTORY directives. Useful on slave replication servers.
#
# NO_ENGINE 				Control automatic substitution of the default storage engine when a statement such as CREATE_TABLE or ALTER_TABLE specifies a 
# _SUBSTITUTION 			storage engine that is disabled or not compiled in.
#
# 								By default, NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION is enabled.
#
# 								Because storage engines can be pluggable at runtime, unavailable engines are treated the same way.
#
# 								With NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION disabled, for CREATE TABLE the default engine is used and a warning occurs if the desired
# 								engine is unavailable.
#
# 								For ALTER_TABLE, a warning occurs and the table is not altered.
#
# 								With NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION enabled, an error occurs and the table is not created or altered if the desired engine is unavailable.
#
# NO_UNSIGNED 				Subtraction between integer values, where one is of type UNSIGNED, produces an unsigned result by default.
# _SUBTRACTION 			If the result would otherwise have been negative, an error results:
#
# 									SET sql_mode = '';
# 									Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 									SELECT CAST(0 AS UNSIGNED) -1;
# 									ERROR 1690 (22003): BIGINT UNSIGNED value is out of range in '(cast(0 as unsigned) - 1)'
#
# 								If the NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION SQL mode is enabled, the result is negative:
#
# 									SET sql_mode = 'NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION';
# 									SELECT CAST(0 AS UNSIGNED) - 1;
# 
# 									+---------------------------------------+
# 									| CAST(0 AS UNSIGNED) 	-  	1 			 |
# 									+---------------------------------------+
# 									| 									  -1 			 |
# 									+---------------------------------------+
#
# 								If the result of such an operation is used to update an UNSIGNED integer column, the result is 
# 								clipped to the maximum value for the column type - or clipped to 0 if NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION is enabled.
#
# 								With strict SQL mode enabled, an error occurs and the column remains unchanged.
#
# 								When NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION is enabled, the subtraction result is signed, even if any operand is unsigned.
# 		
# 								For example - compare the type of column c2 in table t1 with that of column c2 in table t2:
#
# 									SET sql_mode='';
# 									CREATE TABLE test (c1 BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL);
# 									CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT c1 - 1 AS c2 FROM test;
# 									DESCRIBE t1;
#
# 									+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
# 									| Field 	| 	Type 							| Null | Key | Default| Extra |
# 									+--------+--------------------------+------+-----+--------+-------+
# 									| c2 		| bigint(21) unsigned 		| NO 	 | 	 | 0 		 | 		|
# 									+--------+--------------------------+------+-----+--------+-------+
#
# 									SET sql_mode='NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION';
# 									CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT c1 - 1 AS c2 FROM test;
# 									DESCRIBE t2;
#
# 									+------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 									| Field | Type 							| Null | Key | Default | Extra |
# 									+-------+---------------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
# 									| c2 	  | bigint(21) 					| NO 	 | 	 | 0 		  | 		 |
# 									+-------+---------------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
#
# 								This simply means that BIGINT UNSIGNED is not 100% usable in all contexts.
#
# NO_ZERO_DATE
#
# 								The NO_ZERO_DATE mode affects whether the server permits '0000-00-00' as a valid date.
# 								Its effect also depends on whether strict SQL mode is enabled.
#
# 									If this mode is not enabled, '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce no warning.
#
# 									If this mode is enabled, '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce a warning.
#
# 									If this mode and strict is enabled, '0000-00-00' is not permitted and inserts produce an error,
# 									unless IGNORE is given as well. (For INSERT IGNORE and UPDATE IGNORE, '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce a warning)
#
# 								This mode is deprecated. Should be used with Strict, is not part of it. Produces warning if one is used without other, etc.
#
# NO_ZERO_IN_DATE 		The NO_ZERO_IN_DATE mode affects whether the server permits dates in which the year part is nonzero but the month or day part is 0.
# 								(This mode affects dates such as '2010-00-01' or '2010-01-00' - but not '0000-00-00')
#
# 								To control whether the server permits '0000-00-00', use the NO_ZERO_DATE mode.
#
# 								The effect of NO_ZERO_IN_DATE also depends on whether strict SQL mode is enabled.
#
# 									If this mode is not enabled, dates with zero parts are permitted and inserts produce no warning.
#
# 									If this mode is enabled, dates with zero parts are inserted as '0000-00-00' and produce a warning.
#
# 									If this mode and strict mode is enabled,  dates with zero parts are not permitted and inserts produce an error,
# 									unless IGNORE is given as well. (For INSERT IGNORE and UPDATE IGNORE, dates with zero parts are inserted as '0000-00-00' and produce a warning).
#
#
# 								Deprecated. not part of Strict. Warning if not used with Strict, etc.
#
# ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY 	Reject queries for which the select list, HAVING condition or ORDER BY list refer to nonaggregated columns that are 
# 								neither named in the GROUP BY clause nor are functionally dependant on (uniquely determined by) GROUP BY columns.
#
# 								A MySQL extension to standard SQL permits references in the HAVING clause to aliased expressions in the select list.
# 								The HAVING clause can refer to aliases regardless of whether ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY is enabled.
#
# PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH
#
# 								By default, trailing spaces are trimmed from CHAR column values on retrieval.
#
# 								If PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH is enabled, trimming does not occur and retrieved CHAR values are padded
# 								to their full length.
#
# 								This mode does not apply to VARCHAR columns, for which trialing spaces are retained on retrieval.
#
# 								NOTE: Deprecated as of 8.0.13
#
# 								CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 CHAR(10));
# 								Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.37 secs)
#
# 								INSERT INTO t1 (c1) VALUES('xy'));
#  							Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
#
# 								SET sql_mode = '';
# 								Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 								SELECT c1 CHAR_LENGTH(c1) FROM t1;
#
# 								+----------------------------------+
# 								| c1 		| 	CHAR_LENGTH(c1) 		  |
# 								+--------+-------------------------+
# 								| xy 		| 								2 |
# 								+--------+-------------------------+

# 								| xy 			| 						 	10|
# 								+-----------+----------------------+
# 								1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#
# PIPES_AS_CONCAT
#
# Treat |_| as a string concatenation operator (same as CONCAT()) rather than as a synonym for OR.
#
# REAL_AS_FLOAT
#
# Treat REAL as a synonym for FLOAT. By default, MySQL treats REAL as a synonym for DOUBLE.
#
# STRICT_ALL_TABLES
#
# Enable strict SQL mode for all storage engines. INvalid data values are rejected.
#
# STRICT_TRANS_TABLES
#
# Enable strict SQL mode for transactional storage engines, and when possible for nontransactional storage engines.
#
# TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL
#
# Control whether rounding or truncation occurs when inserting a TIME, DATE, or TIMESTAMP value with a fractional
# seconds part into a column having the same type but fewer fractional digits.
#
# The behavior is to use rounding. If this mode is enabled, truncation occurs instead.
# The followin sequence of statements illustrates the difference:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t (id INT tval TIME(1));
# 		SET sql_mode='';
# 		INSERT INTO t (id, tval) VALUES(1, 1.55);
# 		SET sql_mode='TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL';
# 		INSERT INTO t (id, tval) VALUES(2, 1.55);
#
# The resulting table looks like this, where the first value has been subject to rounding and the second to truncation:
#
# 		SELECT id, tval FROM t ORDER BY id;
# 		+--------------------------+
# 		| id 		| 		tval 			|
# 		+--------+-----------------+
# 		| 		1 	| 00:00:01.6 		|
# 		| 		2  | 00:00:01.5 		|
# 		+--------+-----------------+
#
# ANSI is equivalent to:
#
# 		REAL_AS_FLOAT, PIPES_AS_CONCAT, ANSI_QUOTES, IGNORE_SPACE and ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
#
# 		ANSI mode also causes the server to return an error for queries where a set function S with an outer reference S(outer_ref) cannot be
# 		aggregated in the outer query against which the outer reference has been resolved. This is such a query:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT MAX(t1.b) FROM t2 WHERE ...);
#
# 		Here - MAX(t1.b) cannot aggregate in the outer query because it appears in the WHERE clause of that query.
#
# 		Standard SQL requires an error in this situation. If ANSI mode is not enabled, the server treats S(outer_ref) in such
# 		queries the same way that it would interpret S(const)
#
# TRADITIONAL
#
# 		TRADITIONAL is equivalent to STRICT_TRANS_TABLES, STRICT_ALL_TABLES, NO_ZERO_IN_DATE, NO_ZERO_DATE, ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO
# 		and NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUION
#
# The following pertains to STRICT SQL MODE:
#
# Controls how MySQL handles invalid or missing values in data-change statements such as INSERT or UPDATE.
# A value can be invalid for several reasons.
#
# For example, it might have the wrong data type for the column, or it might be out of range.
#
# A value is missing when a new row to be inserted does not contain a value for a non-NULL column that has
# no explicit DEFAULT clause in its definition. (For a NULL column, NULL is inserted if the value is missing).
#
# Strict mode also affects DDL statements such as CREATE_TABLE.
#
# If strict mode is not in effect, MySQL inserts adjusted values for invalid or missing values and produces warnings.
#
# In strict mode, you can produce this behavior by using INSERT_IGNORE or UPDATE_IGNORE.
#
# For statements such as SELECT that do not change data, invalid values generate a warning in stirct mode, not an error.
#
# Strict mode produces an error for attempts to create a key that exceeds the max key length. When strict mode is not enabled,
# this results in a warning and truncation of the key to the max key length.
#
# Strict mode does not affect whether foreign key constraints are checked. Foreign_key_checks can be used for that.
#
# Strict SQL mode is in effect if either STRICT_ALL_TABLES or STRICT_TRANS_TABLES is enabled, although the effects of these
# modes differ somewhat:
#
# 		For transactional tables, an error occurs for invalid or missing values in a data-change statement when either STRICT_ALL_TABLES or 
# 		STRICT_TRANS_TABLES is enabled. The statement is aborted and rolled back.
#
# 		For nontransactional tables, the behavior is the same for either mode if the bad value occurs in the first row to be inserted or updated:
# 			The statement is aborted and the table remains unchanged.
#
# 			If the statement inserts or modifies multiple rows and the bad value occurs in the second or later row, the result depends
# 			on which strict mode is enabled:
#
# 				For STRICT_ALL_TABLES, MySQL returns an error and ignores the rest of the rows.
# 											  However, because the earlier rows have been inserted or updated, the result is a partial update.
# 											  To avoid this, use single-row statements which can be aborted without changing the table.
#
# 				For STRICT_TRANS_TABLES, MySQL converts an invalid value to the closest valid value for the column and inserts the adjusted value.
# 											  If a value is missing, MySQL inserts the implicit default value for the column data type.
#
# 											  In either case, MySQL generates a warning rather than an error and continues processing the statement.
# 											  Implicit defaults are described later.
#
# 		Strict mode affects handling of division by zero, zero dates  and zero in dates as follows:
#
# 			Strict mode affects handling of division by zero, which includes MOD(N,0):
#
# 				For data-change operations (INSERT,UPDATE):
#
# 					If strict mode is not enabled, division by zero inserts NULL and produces no warning.
#	
# 					If strict mode is enabled, division by zero produces an error, unless IGNORE is given as well.
# 					For INSERT IGNORE and UPDATE IGNORE, division by zero inserts NULL and produces a warning.
#
# 				For SELECT, division by zero returns NULL. Enabling strict mode causes a warning to be produced as well.
#
# 			Strict mode affects whether the server permits '0000-00-00' as a valid date:
#
# 				If strict mode is not enabled, '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce no warning.
#
# 				If strict mode is enabled, '0000-00-00' is not permitted and inserts produce an error, unless IGNORE is given as well.
# 				For INSERT IGNORE and UPDATE IGNORE '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce a warning.
#
# 			Strict mode affects whether the server permits dates in which the year part is nonzero but the month or day part is 0 (dates such as '2010-00-01' or '2010-01-00'):
#
# 				If stict mode is not enabled, dates with zero parts are permitted and inserts produce no warning.
#
# 				If strict mode is enabled, dates with zero parts are not permitted and inserts produce an error, unless IGNORE is given as well.
# 				For INSERT IGNORE and UPDATE IGNORE, dates with zero parts are inserted as '0000-00-00' (which is considered valid with IGNORE) and produces a warning.
#
# 			Strict mode affects handling of division by zero, zero dates, and zeros in dates in conjunction with the ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO, NO_ZERO_DATE and
# 			NO_ZERO_IN_DATE modes.
#
# COMPARISON OF THE IGNORE KEYWORD AND STRICT SQL MODE
#
# 		Compres the effect on statement execution of the IGNORE keyword (which downgrades errors to warnings) and strict SQL mode (which upgrades warnings to
# 		errors). It describes which statements they affect, and which errors they apply to.
#
# 		THe following table presents a summary comparison of statement behavior when the default is to produce an error versus a warning.
#
# 		An example of when the default is to produce an error is inserting a NULL into a NOT NULL column.
#
# 		An example of when the default is to produce a warning is inserting a value of the wrong data type into a 
# 		column (such as inserting the string 'abc' into a integer column)
#
# 						OPS MODE 										WHEN STATEMENT DEFAULT IS ERROR 							WHEN STATEMENT DEFAULT IS WARNING
# 				Without IGNORE or strict SQL mode 				Error 															Warning
# 				With IGNORE 											Warning 															Warning (same as without IGNORE or strict SQL mode)
# 				With strict SQL mode 								Error (same as without IGNORE or strict SQL mode) 	Error
# 				With IGNORE and strict SQL mode 					Warning 															Warning
#
# 		One conclusion to draw from the table is that when the IGNORE keyword and strict SQL mode are both in effect,
# 		IGNORE takes precedence.
#
# 		This means that, although IGNORE and strict SQL mode can be considered to have opposite effects on error handling, they do not cancel each other.
#
# THE EFFECT OF IGNORE ON STATEMENT EXECUTION
#
# Several statements in MySQL support an optional IGNORE keyword. This keyword causes the server to downgrade certain types of errors
# and generate warnings instead. 
#
# For a multiple-row statement, IGNORE causes the statements to skip to the next row instead of aborting.
#
# For example, if the table t has a primary key column i, attempting to insert the same value of i into multiple
# rows normally produces a duplicate-key error:
#
# INSERT INTO t (i) VALUES(1),(1);
# ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'
#
# If we run with IGNORE, A warning is produced instead of an error - though, duplication is still not inserted:
#
# INSERT IGNORE INTO t (i) VALUES(1),(1);
# Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)
# Records: 2 Duplicates: 1 Warnings: 1
#
# SHOW WARNINGS;
# +----------------------------------------------------------+
# | Level 	| 	Code 	| Message 					  					 |
# +---------+--------+---------------------------------------+
# | Warning | 1062 	| Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY' |
# +----------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#
# These statements supports the IGNORE keyword:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE ... SELECT. IGNORE does not apply to the CREATE TABLE or SELECT parts of the statement but to inserts into
# 		the table of rows produced by the SELECT.
#
# 		Rows that duplicate an existing row on a unique key value are discarded.
#
# 		DELETE: IGNORE causes MySQL to ignore errors during the process of deleting rows.
#
# 		INSERT: With IGNORE, rows that duplicate an existing row on a unique key value are discarded.
# 
# 				  Rows set to values that would cause data conversion errors are set to the closest valid values instead.
#
# 				  For partitioned tables where no partition matching a given value is found, IGNORE causes the insert operation 
# 				  to fail silently for rows containing the unmatched value.
#
# 		LOAD_DATA, LOAD_XML: With IGNORE, rows that duplicate an existing row on a unique key value are discarded.
#
# 		UPDATE: With IGNORE, rows for which duplicate-key conflicts occur on a unique key value are not updated.
#
# 				  Rows updated to values that would cause data conversion errors are updated to the closest valid values instead.
#
# The IGNORE keyword applies to the following errors:
#
# 		ER_BAD_NULL_ERROR
# 		ER_DUP_ENTRY
# 		ER_DUP_ENTRY_WITH_KEY_NAME
# 		ER_DUP_KEY
# 		ER_NO_PARTITION_FOR_GIVEN_VALUE
# 		ER_NO_PARTITION_FOR_GIVEN_VALUE_SILENT
# 		ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW_2
#
# 		ER_ROW_DOES_NOT_MATCH_GIVEN_PARTITION_SET
# 		ER_ROW_IS_REFERENCED_2
# 		ER_SUBQUERY_NO_1_ROW
# 		ER_VIEW_CHECK_FAILED
#
# THE EFFECT OF STRICT SQL MODE ON STATEMENT EXECUTION
#
# The MySQL server can operate in different SQL modes, and can apply these modes differently for different clients, depending
# on the value of the sql_mode SYS_VAR.
#
# In "strict" SQL mode, the server upgrades certain warnings to errors.
#
# For example, in non-strict SQL mode, inserting the string 'abc' into an integer column results in conversion of
# the value to 0 and a warning:
#
# SET sql_mode = '';
# Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# INSERT INTO t (i) VALUES('abc');
# Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)
#
# SHOW WARNINGS;
# +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | Level 		| Code 	| 		Message 															|
# +------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------+
# | Warning 	| 1366 	| Incorrect integer value: 'abc' for column 'i' at row 1 |
# +------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#
# In strict SQL mode, the invalid value is rejected with an error:
#
# SET sql_mode = 'STRICT_ALL_TABLES';
# Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# INSERT INTO t (i) VALUES ('abc');
# ERROR 1366 (HY000): Incorrect integer value: 'abc' for column 'i' at row 1
#
# Strict SQL mode applies the following statements under conditions for which some value might be out of
# range or an invalid row is inserted into or deleted from a table:
#
# ALTER_TABLE
#
# CREATE_TABLE
#
# CREATE_TABLE_..._SELECT
#
# DELETE (both single table and multiple table)
#
# INSERT
#
# LOAD_DATA
# 
# LOAD_XML
#
# SELECT_SLEEP()
#
# UPDATE (both single and multiple tables)
#
# Within stored programs, individual statements of the types just listed execute in strict SQL mode if the program was defined 
# while strict mode was in effect.
#
# Strict SQL mode applies to the following errors, represent a class of errors in which an input value is either invalid or missing.
# A value is invalid if it has the wrong data type for the column or might be out of range.
#
# A value is missing if a new row to be inserted does not contain a value for a NOT NULL column that has no explicit DEFAULT clause
# in its definition.
#
# ER_BAD_NULL_ERROR
# ER_CUT_VALUE_GROUP_CONCAT
# ER_DATA_TOO_LONG

#
# The following section pertains to IPv6 Support
#
# Support for IPv6 in MySQL includes these capabilities:
#
# 		MySQL Server can accept TCP/IP connections from clients connecting over IPv6.
#
# 		For example, this command connects over IPv6 to the MySQL server on the local host:
#
# 			mysql -h ::1
#
# 		To use this capability - two conditions must hold true:
#
# 			The system must be configured to support IPv6.
#
# 			The default MySQL server configuration permits IPv6 connections in addition to IPv4 connections.
# 			To change the default configuration, start the server with an appropiate --bind-address option.
#
# 		MySQL account names permit IPv6 addresses to enable DBAs to specify privs for clients that connect 
# 		to the server over IPv6.
#
# 		IPv6 addresses can be specified in account names in statements such as CREATE_USER, GRANT, and REVOKE.
#
# 		For example:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'bill'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
# 			GRANT SELECT ON mydb.* TO 'bill'@'::1';
#
# 		IPv6 functions enable conversion between string and internal format IPv6 address formats, and checking whether
# 		values represent valid IPv6 addresses.
#
# 		For example, INET6_ATON() and INET6_NTOA() are similar to INET_ATON() and INET_NTOA(), but handle IPv6 in addition
# 		to IPv4 addresses.
#
# The following pertains to verifying system support for IPv6.
#
# Before MySQL server can accept IPv6 connections, the operating system on your server host must support IPv6.
# As a simple test to determine whether that is true - try:
#
# 		ping6 ::1
# 		16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=0 hlim=64 time=0.171 ms
# 		16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=0.077 ms
#
# To produce a description of your system's network interfaces, invoke ifconfig -a and look for IPv6 addresses in the output.
#
# If your host does not support IPv6, the reasoning can differ. It can require configuring an existing network config to add an IPv6 address.
# Or you might need to rebuild the kernel with IPv6 options enabled.
#
# There are links to cover for the Linux integrations. But this project focuses on MySQL - one part at a time.
#
# The MySQL server listens on a single network socket for TCP/IP connections.
#
# This socket is bound to a single address, but it is possible for an address to map unto multiple network interfaces.
# To specify an address, use the --bind-address=<addr> option at server startup, where <addr> is an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a host name.
#
# The following pertains to connecting to Local Host address connections using IPv6.
#
# The following procedure shows how to configure MySQL to permit IPv6 connections by clients that connect to the local server using
# the ::1 local host address.
#
# The instructions are based on support of IPv6.
#
# 		1. Start the MySQL server with an appropriate --bind-address option to permit it to accept IPv6 connections.
# 			For example, put the following lines in the server option file and restart the server:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				bind-address = *
#
# 			Alternatively, you can bind the server to ::1, but that makes the server more restrictive for TCP/IP connections.
# 			It accepts only IPv6 connections for that single address and rejects IPv4 connections. 
#
# 		2. As an administrator, connect to the server and create an account for a local user who will connect from the ::1 local IPv6 host address:
#
# 				CREATE USER 'ipv6user'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'ipv6pass';
#
# 			For the permitted syntax of Ipv6 addresses in account names - it's covered later.
#
# 			In addition to the CREATE_USER statement, you can issue GRANT statements that give specific
# 			privs to the account, although that is not necessary for this part.
#
# 		3. Invoke the mysql client to connect to the server using the new account:
#
# 				mysql -h ::1 -u ipv6user -pipv6pass
#
# 		4. Try some simple statements that show connection information:
#
# 				STATUS
# 				...
# 				Connection: 	::1 via TCP/IP
# 				...
# 
# 				SELECT CURRENT_USER(), @@bind_address;
# 				+------------------------------------+
# 				| CURRENT_USER() | @@bind_address 	 |
# 				+----------------+-------------------+
# 				| ipv6user@::1   | :: 					 |
# 				+----------------+-------------------+
#
# The following section pertains to Connecting Using IPv6 Nonlocal Host Addresses
#
# The following procedure shows how to configure MySQL to permit IPv6 connections by remote clients.
#
# It is similar to the preceding procedure for local clients, but the server and client hosts are
# distinct and each has its own nonlocal ipv6 address.
#
# The example uses the addresses of:
#
# Server host: 2001:db8:0:f101::1
# Client host: 2001:db8:0:f101::2
#
# These addresses are chosen from the nonroutable address range recommended by IANA for documentation purposes/testing.
# To accept IPv6 connections from clients outside the local network, the server host must have a public address.
#
# If your network provider assigns you an IPv6 address, you can use that.
#
# Otherwise, another way to obtain an address is to use an IPv6 broker.
#
# 		1. Start the MySQL server with an appropriate --bind-address option to permit it to accept IPv6 connections.
# 			For example, put the following lines in the server option file and restart the server:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				bind-address = *
#
# 			Alternatively, you can bind the server to 2001:db8:0:f101::1, but that makes the server more restrictive for TCP/IP
# 			connections.
#
# 			It accepts only IPv6 connections for that single address and rejects IPv4 connections.
#
# 		2. On the server host (2001:db8:0:f101::1), create an account for a user who will connect from the client host (2001:db8:f101::2)
#
# 			CREATE USER 'remoteipv6user'@'2001:db8:0:f101::2' IDENTIFIED BY 'remoteipv6pass';
#
# 		3. On the client host (2001:db8:0:f101::2), invoke the mysql client to connect to the server using the new account:
#
# 			mysql -h 2001:db8:0:f101::1 -u remoteipv6user -premoteipv6pass
#
# 		4. Trying some simple commands to see that it works:
#
# 				STATUS
# 				...-
# 				Connection: 	2001:db8:0:f101::1 via TCP/IP
# 				...- 
# 
# 				SELECT CURRENT_USER(), @@bind_address;
# 				+-----------------------------------+----------------+
# 				| CURRENT_USER() 						   | @@bind_address |
# 				+-----------------------------------+----------------+
# 				| remoteipv6user@2001:db8:0:f101::2 | :: 				  |
# 				+-----------------------------------+----------------+
#
# The following part pertains on how to obtain an IPv6 Address from a Broker
#
# If you do not have a public IPv6 address that enables your system to communicate over IPv6 outside of your local network,
# you can obtain one from an Ipv6 broker.
#
# After configuring your server host to use a broker-supplied IPv6 address, start the MySQL server with an appropiate --bind-address
# option to permit the server to accept IPv6 connections.
#
# For example, put the following lines in the server option file and restart the server:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		bind-address = *
#
# Alternatively, you can bind the server to the specific IPv6 address provided by the broker, but that makes the server more
# restrictive for TCP/IP connections.
#
# In addition, if the broker allocates dynamic addresses, the address provided for your system might change the next time
# you connect to the broker.
#
# If so, any accounts you create that name the original address, become invalid.
#
# To bind to a specific address but avoid this change-of-address problem, you may be able to arrange with the broker
# for a static IPv6 address.
#
# The following example is for how ot use the Freenet6 as the broker and the gogoc IPv6 client package on Gentoo Linux.
#
# 1. Create an acc on their website -> http://gogonet.gogo6.com
#
# 2. Create the user ID and PW for the IPv6 broker: -> http://gogonet.gogo6.com/page/freenet6-registration
#
# 3. As root, install gogoc:
#
# 		emerge gogoc
#
# 4. Edit /etc/gogoc/gogoc.conf to set the userid and password values. For example:
#
# 		userid=gogouser
# 		passwd=gogopass
#
# 5. Start gogoc:
#
# 		/etc/init.d/gogoc start
#
# 		To start gogoc on system boot:
#
# 		rc-update add gogoc default
#
# 6. ping6 to ping a host:
#
# 		ping6 ipv6.google.com
#
# 7. to see your Ipv6 address:
#
# 		ifconfig tun
#
# The following section pertains to MySQL Server Time Zone Support
#
# MySQL Server maintains several time zone settings:
#
# 		1. The system time zone. When the server starts, it attempts to determine the time zone of the host machine and uses it to set the 
# 		system_time_zone SYS_VAR. Does not change thereafter.
#
# 		Can set the SYS_VAR time zone for MySQL Server at startup with the --timezone=<timezone_name> option to mysqld_safe.
#
# 		You can also set it by setting the TZ environment variable before you start mysqld.
#
# 		The permissible values for --timezone or TZ are system dependent. 
#
# 		2. The server's current time zone. The global time_zone system variable indicates the time zone the server currently is operating in.
# 			The initial value for time_zone is 'SYSTEM', which indicates that the server time zone is the same as the system time zone.
#
# 				NOTE: If set to SYSTEM, every MySQL function call that requires a timezone calculation makes a system library call to determine
# 						the current system timezone. This call may be protected by a global mutex, resulting in contention.
#
# 			The initial global server time zone value can be specified explicitly at startup with the --default-time-zone=<timezone> option on the
# 			cmd line, or you can use the following line in an option file:
#
# 				default-time-zone='timezone'
#
# 			If you have the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER priv, you can set the global server time zone value at runtime with this statement:
#
# 				SET GLOBAL time_zone = timezone;
#
# 			Per-connection time zones. Each client that connects has its own time zone setting, given by the session time_zone variable.
# 			Initially, the session variable takes its value from the global time_zone variable, but the client can change its own time zone
# 			with this statement:
#
# 				SET time_zone = timezone;
#
# 		The current session time zone setting affects display and storage of time values that are zone-sensitive.
#
# 		This includes the values displayed by functions such as NOW() or CURTIME(), and values stored in and retrieved
# 		from TIMESTAMP columns.
#
# 		Values for TIMESTAMP columns are converted from the current time zone to UTC for storage, and from UTC to the current
# 		time zone for retrieval.
#
# 		The current time zone setting does not affect values displayed by functions such as UTC_TIMESTAMP() or values in DATE, TIME, or DATETIME
# 		columns.
#
# 		Nor are values in those data types stored in UTC; the time zone applies for them only when converting from TIMESTAMP values.
# 		If you want locale-specific arithmetic for DATE, TIME or DATETIME - convert them to UTC, perform the arithemtic, and convert back.
#
# 		The current values of the global and client-specific time zones can be retrieved like this:
#
# 			SELECT @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone;
#
# 		<timezone> values can be given in several formats, none of which are case-sensitive:
#
# 			The value 'SYSTEM' indicates that hte time zone should be the same as hte SYS time zone.
#
# 			The vlaue can be given as a string indicating an offset from UTC, such as '+10:00' or '-6:00'
#
# 			The value can be given as a named time zone, such as 'Europe/Helsinki', 'US/Eastern', or 'MET'.
# 			Named time zones can be used only if the time zone information tables in the mysql DB have been created and populated.
#
# POPULATING THE TIME ZONE TABLES
#
# Several tables in the MySQL system DB exists to maintain time zone info.
# The MySQL installation procedure creates the time zone tables, but does not load them.
#
# You must do so manually using the following instructions.
#
# NOTE: Loading the time zone information is not necessarily a one-time operation because the information 
# 		  changes ocassionally. When such changes occur, applications that use the old rules becomes out of date
# 	     and you may find it necessary to reload the time zone tables to keep the information used by your MySQL
# 		  sever current.
#
# If your system has its own zoneinfo DB (the set of files describing time zones), you should use the mysql_tzinfo_to_sql
# program for filling the time zone tables.
#
# Examples of such systems are Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and macOS. One likely location for these files is the /usr/share/zoneinfo dir.
# If your system does not have a zoneinfo db, you can use the downloadable package described later.
#
# The mysql_tzinfo_to_sql program is used to load the time zone tables.
#
# On the cmd line, pass the zoneinfo dir path name to mysql_tzinfo_to_sql and send the output into the mysql program.
# For example:
#
# 		mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql
#
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql reads your Systems time zone files and generates SQL statements from them.
# mysql processes those statements to load the time zone tables.
#
# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql also can be used to load a single time zone file or to generate leap second information.
#
# 		> To load a single time zone file <tz_file> that correponds to a time zone name <tz_name>, invoke mysql_tzinfo_to_sql as such:
#
# 			mysql_tzinfo_to_sql <tz_file> <tz_name> | mysql -u root mysql
#
# 		With this approach, you must execute a separate command to load the time zone files for each named zone that hte server needs to know about.
#
# 		> If your time zone needs to account for leap seconds, intiialize the leap second information like this, where <tz_file> is the name of your time zone file:
#
# 			mysql_tzinfo_to_sql --leap <tz_file> | mysql -u root mysql
#
# 		> After running mysql_tzinfo_to_sql, it is best to restart the server so that it does not continue to use any previously cached time zone data.
#
# 		If your system is one that has no zoneinfo DB (for example, Windows), you can use a package that is available for download at the MySQL Developer Zone:
#
# 			https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/timezones.html
#
# 		Download a time zone package that contains SQL statements and unpack it, then load the package file contents into the time zone tables:
#
# 			mysql -u root mysql < <file_name>
#
# 		THen restart the server.
#
# 		Warning: Do NOT use a downloadable package that contains any MyISAM tables. MySQL uses INnoDB for the Time zone Tables. Trying to replace them with MyISAM tables causes issues.
#
# 		Warning: Do NOT use a downloadable package that if your system has a zoneinfo database. Use the mysql_tzinfo_to_sql utility instead.
# 					Othehrwise, you may cause a difference in datetime handling between MySQL and other apps on your system.
#
# The following section pertains to Staying Current with Time Zone Changes
#
# 		When time zone rules change, applications that use the old rules become out of date.
#
# 		TO stay current, it is necessary to make sure that oyur system uses current time zone info.
# 		There are two factors to consider in this.
#
# 			1) The OS time affects the value that the MySQL server uses for times if its time zone is set to SYSTEM.
# 				Make sure that your OS is using the latest time zone info.
#
# 				For most OS's, the latest update or service pack prepares your system for the time changes.
# 				
# 			2) If you replace the system's /etc/localtime timezone file with a version that uses rules differing from those in
# 				effect at mysqld startup, you should restart mysqld so that it uses the updated rules.
#
# 				Otherwise, mysqld might not notice when the system changes its time.
#
# 			3) If you use named time zones with MySQL, make sure that the time zone tables in the mysql DB are up to date.
# 				
# 				IF your system has its own zoneinfo DB, you should reload the MySQL time zone tables whenever hte zoneinfo
# 				DB is updated.
#
# 				FOr systems that do not have their own zoneinfo DB, check the MySQL Develop Zone for updates.
#
# 				When a new update is available, download it and use it to replace the current time zone tables.
#
# 				Mysqld caches time zone information that it looks up, so after updating the time zone tables, you should
# 				restart mysqld to make sure that it does not continue to serve outdated time zone data.
#
# 		If you are uncertain whether named time zones are available, for use either as the server's time zone setting or by clients that
# 		set their own time zone, check whether your time zone tables are empty.
#
# 		The following query determines whether the table that contains time zone names has any rows.
#
# 				SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.time_zone_name;
# 				+-----------------------------+
# 				| COUNT(*) 							|
# 				+-----------------------------+
# 				| 		0 								|
# 				+-----------------------------+
#
# 		A count of zero indicates that its empty.
#
# 		In this case, no one can be using named time zones, and you do not need to update the tables.
#
# 		A count greater than zero indicates that the table is not empty and that its contents are available
# 		to be used for named time support.
#
# 		In this case, you should be sure to reload your time zone tables so that anyone who uses named time zones will get correct query results.
#
# 		To check whether your MySQL installation is updated properly for a change in Daylight Saving Time rules, use a test like the one following.
# 		The example uses values that are appropiate for the 2007 DST 1-hour change that occurs in the US on march 11 at 2 a.m.
#
# 		SELECT CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 2:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central');
# 		SELECT CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 3:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central');
#
# 		The two time values indicate the times at which the DST change occurs, and the use of named time zones requires that the time zone tables be used.
# 		THe desired result is that both queries return the same result (the input time, converted to the equivalent value in the 'US/Central' time zone).
#
# 		Before updating the time zone tables, you would see an incorrect result like this:
#
# 			SELECT CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 2:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central');
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 2:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central') 	  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| 2007-03-11 01:00:00 															  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 			SELECT CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 3:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central');
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 3:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central') 	  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| 2007-03-11 02:00:00 															  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		After updating the tables, you should get hte correct results:
#
# 			SELECT CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 3:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central');
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
## 		| CONVERT_TZ('2007-03-11 3:00:00', 'US/Eastern', 'US/Central') 	  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| 2007-03-11 01:00:00 															  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# The following section covers Time Zone Leap Seond Support
#
# Leap second values are returned with a time part that ends with :59:59.
#
# THis means that a function such as NOW() can return the same value for two or three consecutive
# seconds during the leap second.
#
# It remains true that literal temporal values having a time part that ends with :59:60 or :59:61 are considered invalid.
#
# If it is necessary to search for TIMESTAMP values one second before the leap second, anomalous results may be obtained if you
# use a comparison with 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss' values.
#
# The following example demonstrates this. It changes the local time zone to UTC so there is no difference between internal values
# (which are in UTC) and displayed values (which have time zone correction applied)
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 				a INT, ts TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(), PRIMARY KEY (ts));
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
# 
# 		-- Change to UTC
# 		SET time_zone = '+00:00';
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 		-- Simulate NOW() = '2008-12-31 23:59:59' -

#
# 		INSERT INTO t1 (a) VALUES (2);
# 		Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

# The following section pertains to Server Tracking of Client Session State Changes
#
# The MySQL server implements several session state trackers. A client can enable these trackers to receive notification 
# of changes to its session state.
#
# One use for the tracker mechanism is to provide a means for MySQL connectors and client applications to determine whether
# any session context is available to permit session migration from one server to another.
#
# (To change sessions in a load-balanced environment, it is necessary to detect whether there is session states to take into
#  consideraiton when deciding whether a switch can be made)
#
# Another use for the tracker mechanism is to permit applications to know when transactions can be moved from one session to another.
# Transaction state tracking enables this, which is useful for applications that may wish to move transactions from a busy server
# to one that is less loaded.
#
# For example, a load-balancing connector managing a client connection pool could move transactions between available sessions in the pool.
#
# However, session switching cannot be done at arbitrary times. If a session is in the middle of a transaction for which reads or writes
# have been done, switching to a different session implies a transaction rollback on the original session.
#
# A session switch must be done only when a transaction does not yet have any reads or writes performed within it.
#
# Examples of when transactions might reasonably be switched:
#
# 		Immediately after START_TRANSACTION
#
# 		After COMMIT_AND_CHAIN
#
# In addition to knowing transaction state, it is useful to know transaction characteristics, so as to use the same characteristics if
# the transaction is moved to a different session.
#
# The following characteristics are relevant for this purpose:
#
# 		READ ONLY 
# 		READ WRITE
# 		ISOLATION LEVEL
# 		WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT
#
# To support the preceding session-switching activities, notification is available for these types of client session state information.
#
# 		1) Changes to these attributes of client session state:
#
# 				The default schema (database)
#
# 				Session-specific values for system variables
#
# 				User-defined variables
#
# 				Temporary tables
#
# 				Prepared statements
#
# 			The session_track_state_change system variable controls this tracker.
#
# 		2) Changes to the default schema name. The session_track_schema SYS_VAR controls this tracker.
#
# 		3) Changes to the session values of SYS_VARs. The session_track_system_variables SYS_VAR controls this tracker.
#
# 		4) Available GTIDs. The session_track_gtids SYS_VAR controls this tracker.
#
# 		5) Information about transaction state and characteristics. The session_track_transaction_info SYS_VAR controls this tracker.
#
# The SYS_VARs that permit control over which change notifications occur, but do not provide a way to access notification information.
#
# Notification occurs in the MySQL client/server protocol, which includes tracker information in OK packets so that session
# state changes can be detected.
#
# To enable client applications to extract state-change information from OK packets returned by the server, the MySQL C API
# provides a pair of functions:
#
# 		mysql_session_track_get_first() fetches the first part of the state-change information received from the server.
#
# 		mysql_session_track_get_next() fethces any remaining state-change information received from the server.
# 		Following a successful call to mysql_session_track_get_first(), call this function repeatedly as long as it returns success.
#
# The mysqltest program has disable_session_track_info and enable_session_track_info commands that control whether session tracker
# notifications occur.
#
# You can use theese commands to see from the cmd line what notifications SQL statements produce.
# Suppose that a file testscript contains the following mysqltest script:
#
# 		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.t1;
# 		CREATE TABLE test.t1 (i INT, f FLOAT);
# 		--enable_session_track_info
# 		SET @@session.session_track_schema=ON;

# 		INSERT INTO test.t1() VALUES();
# 		INSERT INTO test.t1() VALUES(1, RAND());

# The following section covers Server-Side Help
#
# MySQL Server supports a HELP statement that returns information from the MySQL HELP Syntax.
# Several tables in the mysql system DB contain the information needed to support this statement.
#
# The proper operation of this statement requires that these help tables be initialized, which is done 
# by processing the contents of the fill_help_tables.sql script.
#
# If you install MySQL using a binary or source distrib on Unix, help table content intialization occurs when
# you initialize the data dir.
#
# For an RPM distrib on Linux or binary distrib on Windows, content initialization occurs as part of the MySQL
# install process.
#
# If you upgrade MySQL using a binary distrib, help table content is not upgraded automatically, but you can upgrade it manually.
# Locate the fill_help_tables.sql file in the share or share/mysql dir.
#
# Change location into that dir and process the file with the mysql client as follows:
#
# 		mysql -u root mysql < fill_help_tables.sql
#
# You can also obtain the latest fill_help_tables.sql at any time to upgrade your help tables.
#
# Download the proper file for your version of MySQL from https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html
#
# Process it as above.
#
# If you are working with Git and a MySQL dev source tree, you must use a download copy of the fill_help_tables.sql, because the source
# tree is a stub.
#
# NOTE: For a server that participates in replication, the help table content upgrade process involves multiple servers.
#
# The following part pertains to Server Response to Signals
#
# On Unix, signals can be sent to processes. mysqld responds to signals sent to it as follows:
#
# 		1) SIGTERM causes the server to shut down
#
# 		2) SIGHUP causes the server to reload the grant tables and to flush tables, logs, the thread cache and the host cache.
# 			These actions are like various forms of the FLUSH statement.
#
# 			The server also writes a status report to the error log that has this format:
#
# 				Status information:
#
# 				Current dir: /var/mysql/data/
# 				Running threads: 0 Stack size: 196608
# 				Current locks:
#
# 				Key caches:
# 				default
# 				Buffer_size: 			8388600
# 				Block_size: 				1024
# 				Division_limit: 			 100
# 				Age_limit: 					 300
# 				blocks used: 				   0
# 				not flushed: 					0
# 				w_requests: 					0
# 				writes: 							0
# 				r_requests: 					0
# 				reads: 							0
#
# 				handler status:

# 				delete: 				0
# 				update: 				0
#
# 				Table status:

# 				Open tables: 					0
# 				Open files: 					7
# 				Open streams: 					0
#
# 				Alaram status: 
# 				Active alarms: 		1
# 				Max used alarms: 		2
# 				Next alarm time: 		67
#
# The following section pertains to The Server Shutdown Process
#
# The server shutdown process takes place as follows:
#
# 		1. The shutdown process is initiated.
#
# 			This can occur initiated several ways. For example, a user with the SHUTDOWN priv can execute a mysqladmin shutdown command.
#
# 			mysqladmin can be used on any platform supported by MySQL. Other OS specific shutdown intiaition methods are possible, as well:
#
# 				The server shuts down on Unix when it receives a SIGTERM signal.
# 				A server running as a service on Windows shuts down when the services manager tells it to.
#
# 		2. The server creates a shutdown thread if necessary.
#
# 			Depending on how shutdown was initiated, the server might create a thread to handle the shutdown process.
# 			If shutdown was requested by a client, a shutdown thread is created. 
#
# 			If shutdown is the result of receiving a SIGTERM signal, the signal thread might handle shutdown itself, or it
# 			might create a separate thread to do so.
#
# 			If the server tries to create a shutdown thread and cannot (for example, if memory is exhausted) - it issues a diagnostic message
# 			that appears in the error log:
#
# 				Error: Can't create thread to kill server
#
# 		3. The server stops accepting new connections
#
# 			To prevent new activity from being initiated during shutdown, the server stops accepting new client connections 
# 			by closing the handlers for the network interfaces to which it normally listens for connections:
#
# 				The TCP/IP port, the Unix socket file, the Windows named pipe, and shared memory on Windows.
#
# 		4. The server terminates current activity
#
# 			For each thread associated with a client connection, the server breaks the connection to the client and marks the thread as killed.
# 			Threads die when they notice that they are marked for it.
#
# 			Threads for idle connections die quickly. 
# 			Threads that currently are processing statements check their state periodically and take longer to die.
# 			
# 			There is more info on the KILL syntax, later on.
#
# 			For threads that have an open transaction, the transaction is rolled back.
#
# 			If a thread is updating a nontransactional table, an operation such as multiple-row
# 			UPDATE or INSERT may leave the table partially updated because the operation can terminate before completion. 
#
# 			If the server is a master replication server, it treats threads associated with currently connected slaves like other
# 			client threads.
#
# 			That is - each one is marked as killed and exits when it next checks its state.
#
# 			If the server is a slave replication server, it stops the I/O and SQL threads, if they are active, before
# 			marking client threads as killed.
#
# 			The SQL thread is permitted to finish its current statement (to avoid causing replication problems), and then stops.
#
# 			If the SQL thread is in the middle of a transaction at this point, the server waits until the current replication 
# 			event group (if any) has finished executing, or until the user issues a KILL_QUERY or KILL_CONNECTION statement.
#
# 			Since nontransactional statements cannot be rolled back, in order to guarantee crash-safe replication, only transactional
# 			tables should be used.
#
# 			NOTE: To guarantee crash safety on the slave, you must run the slave with --relay-log-recovery enabled.
#
# 		5. The server shuts down or closes storage engines.
#
# 			At this stage, the server flushes the table cache and closes all open tables.
#
# 			Each storage engine performs any actions necessary for tables that it manages.
#
# 			InnoDB flushes its buffer pool to disk (unless innodb_fast_shutdown is 2), writes the
# 			current LSN to the tablespace, and terminates its own internal threads. 
#
#			MyISAM flushes any pending index writes for a table. 
#
# 		6. The server exits.
#
# To provide information to management processes, the server returns one of the exit codes described in the following list.
#
# The phrase in paranthesis indicates the action taken by systemd in response to the code, for platforms on which systemd
# is used to manage the server.
#
# 0 = successful termination (no restart done)
# 1 = unsuccessful termination (no restart done)
# 2 = unsuccessful termination (restart done)
#
# The following section pertains to The MySQL Data Directory
#
# Information managed by the MySQL server is stored under a dir known as the data dir.
#
# The following list briefly decribes the items typically found in the data dir, with cross
# references for additional info: 			
#
# 		1) Data dir subdirs. Each subdir of the data dir is a DB directory and corresponds to a DB managed by the server.
# 			All mySQL installations have certain standard DBs:
#
# 				a) The mysql dir corresponds to the mysql system DB, which contains information required by the MySQL server as it runs.
# 					The DB contains data dictionary tables and system tables.
#
# 				b) The performance_schema dir corresponds to the Performance schema, which provides information used to inspect the
# 					internal execution of the server at runtime.
#
# 				c) The sys directory corresponds to the sys schema, which provides a set of objects to help interpret Performance Schema
# 					information more easily.
#
# 				d) The ndbinfo directory corresponds to the ndbinfo database that stores information specific to NDB Cluster 
# 					(present only for installations built to include NDB Cluster)
#
# 				-> Other Subdirs correspond to DBs created by users and applications.
#
# 				NOTE: INFORMATION_SCHEMA is a standard DB, but its implementation uses no corresponding database dir.
#
# 		2) Log files written by the server.
#
# 		3) InnoDB tablespace and log files.
#
# 		4) Default/autogenerated SSL and RSA certificate and key files.
#
# 		5) The server process ID (while the server is running)
#
# 		6) The mysqld-auto.cnf file that stores persisted global SYS_VARs.
#
# Some items in the list can be relocated elsewhere by reconfiguring the server.
#
# In addition, the --datadir option enables the location of the data directory itself to be changed.
# For a given MySQL installation, check the server configuration to determine whether items have been moved.
#
# The following section pertains to The mysql System Database
#
# The mysql database is the system database. It contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server as it runs.
#
# A broad categorization is that the mysql database contains data dictionary tables that store DB objects metadata, and system
# tables used for other operational purposes.
#
# The following discussion furhet subdivies the set of system tables into smaller categories:
#
# Data Dictionary Tables
#
# Grant System Tables
#
# Object Information System Tables
#
# Log System Tables
#
# Server-Side Help System Tables
#
# Time Zone System Tables
# 
# Replication System Tables
#
# Optimizer System Tables
#
# Miscellaneous System Tables
#
# The remainder of this section enumerates the tables in each category, with cross references for additional information.
#
# Data dictionary tables and system tables use the InnoDB storage engine unless otherwise indicated.
#
# mysql system tables and data dictionary tables reside in a single InnoDB tablespace file named mysql.ibd in the MySQL data dir.
# Previously, these tables were created in individual tablespace files in the mysql database dir.
#
# DATA DICTIONARY TABLES
#
# These tables comprise the data dictionary, which contains metadata about DB objects.
#
# IMPORTANT: The data dictionary is new in MysQL 8.0 - A data dictionary-enabled server entails some general operational differences compared to
# 				 previous MySQL releases.
#
# 				More details covered later.
#
# catalogs: Catalog information.
#
# character_sets: Information about available character sets.
#
# collations: Information about collations for each character set.
#
# column_statistics: Histogram statistics for column values.
#
# column_type_elements: Information about types used by columns.
#
# columns: Information about columns in tables.
#
# dd_properties: A table that identifies data dictionary properties, such as its version.
# 					  The server uses this to determine whether the data dictionary must be upgraded to a newer version.
#
# events: Information about Event Scheduler events. The server loads events listed in this table during its startup sequence,
# 			 unless started with the --skip-grant-tables option.
#
# foreign_keys, foreign_key_column_usage: Information about foreign keys.
#
# index_column_usage: Information about columns used by indexes.
#
# index_partitions: information about partitions used by indexes.
#
# index_stats: Used to store dynamic index statitics generated when ANALYZE_TABLE is executed.
#
# indexes: Information about table indexes.
#
# innodb_ddl_log: Stores DDL logs for crash-safe DDL operations.
#
# parameter_type_elements: Information about stored procedure and function parameters, and about return values for stored functions.
#
# parameters: Information about stored procedures and functions.
# 
# resource_groups: information about resource groups.
#
# routines: Information about stored procedures and functions.
#
# schemata: information about schemata. In MySQL, a schema is a database, so this table provides info about DBs.
#
# st_spatial_reference_systems: Information about available spatial reference systems for spatial data.
#
# table_partition_values: Information about values used by table partitions.
#
# table_partitions: Information about partitions used by tables.
#
# table_stats: Information about dynamic table statitics generated when ANALYZE_TABLE is executed.
#
# tables: Information about tables in DBs.
#
# tablespace_files: Information about files used by tablespaces.
#
# tablespaces: Information about active tablespaces.
#
# triggers: Information about triggers
#
# view_routine_usage: Information about dependencies between views and stored functions used by them.
#
# view_table_usage: Used to track dependencies between views and their underlying tables.
#
# Data dictionary tables are invisible. They cannot be read with SELECT, do not appear in the output of
# SHOW_TABLES, are not listed in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES table, and so forth.
#
# However, in most cases there are corresponding INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables that can be queried.
# Conceptually, the INFORMATION_SCHEMA provides a view through which MySQL exposes data dictionary metadata.
#
# For example, you cannot select from the mysql.schemata table directly:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM mysql.schemata;
# 		ERROR 3554 (HY000): 	Access to data dictionary table 'mysql.schemata' is rejected.
#
# Instead, select that information from the corresponding INFORMATION_SCHEMA table:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA\G
# 		*************************** 1. row *******************************
# 							CATALOG_NAME: def
# 							SCHEMA_NAME : mysql
# 		DEFAULT_CHARACTER_SET_NAME : utf8mb4
# 			DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME  : utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
# 							SQL_PATH    : NULL
# 		*************************** 2. row *******************************
# 							CATALOG_NAME: def
# 							SCHEMA_NAME : information_schema
# 		DEFAULT_CHARACTER_SET_NAME : utf8
# 			DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME 	: utf8_general_ci
# 							SQL_PATH 	: NULL
#
# There is no INFORMATION_SCHEMA table that corresponds exactly to mysql.indexes, but INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS contains
# much of the same information.
#
# As of yet, there are no INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables that correspond exactly to mysql.foreign_keys,
# mysql.foreign_key_column_usage.
#
# The standard SQL way to obtain foreign key information is by using the :
#
# INFORMATION_SCHEMA, REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS and KEY_COLUMN_USAGE tables; 
#
# These tables are now implemented as views on the foreign_keys, foreign_key_column_usage,
# and other data dictionary tables.
#
# Some system tables from before MySQL 8.0 have been replaced by data dictionary tables and are 
# no longer present in the mysql system database:
#
# 		The events data dictionary table supersedes the event table from before MySQL 8.0
#
# 		The parameters and routines data dictionary tables together supersede the proc table from before MySQL 8.0
#
# GRANT SYSTEM TABLES
#
# These system tables contain grant information about user accounts and the privileges held by them.
# For additional information about the structure, contents and purpose - it is covered later.
#
# As of MySQL 8.0, the grant tables are InnoDB (transactional) tables.
# Previously, these were MyISAM (nontransactional) tables.
#
# The change of grant-table storage engine underlies an accompanying change in MySQL 8.0 to the
# behavior of account-management statements such as CREATE_USER and GRANT.
#
# Previously, an account-management statement that named multiple users could succeed for some 
# users and fail for others.
#
# The statements are now transactional and either succeed for all named users or roll back and 
# have no effect if any error occurs.
#
# NOTE: If MySQL is upgraded from an older version but the grant tables have not been upgraded from
# 		  MyISAM to InnoDB, the server considers them read only and account-management statements
# 	     produce an error.
#
# user: User accounts, global privs, and other non-privilege columns.
#
# global_grants: Assignments of dynamic global privileges to users
#
# db: Database-level privileges
#
# tables_priv: Table-level privileges
#
# columns_priv: Column-level privileges
#
# procs_priv: Stored procedure and function privileges
#
# proxies_priv: Proxy-user privileges
#
# default_roles: This table lists default roles to be activated after a user connects and authenticates, or executes SET_ROLE_DEFAULT
#
# role_edges: This table lists edges for role subgraphs
#
# 				  A given user table row might refer to a user account or a role.
#
# 				  The server can distinguish whether a row represents a user account, a role or both by
# 				  consulting the role_edges table for information about relations between authentication IDs.
#
# password_history: Information about password changes
#
# OBJECT INFORMATION SYSTEM TABLES
#
# These system tables contain information about stored programs, components, user-defined functions, and server-side plugins:
#
# 		component: The registry for server components. Any components listed in this table are installed by a loader service
# 					  during the server startup sequence.
#
# 		func: 	  Information about user-defined functions (UDFs).
# 					  The server loads UDFs listed in this table during its startup sequence, unless
# 					  started with the --skip-grant-tables option.
#
# 		plugin: 	  Information about server-side plugins.
# 					  The server loads plugins listed in this table during its startup sequence,
# 					  unless started with the --skip-grant-tables option.
#
# LOG SYSTEM TABLES
#
# The server uses these system tables for logging:
#
# 		general_log: The general query log table.
#
# 		slow_log: The slow query log table.
#
# Log tables use the CSV storage engine.
#
# SERVER-SIDE HELP SYSTEM TABLES
#
# These system tables contain server-side help information:
#
# 		help_category: Information about help categories.
#
# 		help_keyword: Keywords associated with help topics.
#
# 		help_relation: Mappings between help keywords and topics.
#
# 		help_topic: Help topic contents.
#
# TIME ZONE SYSTEM TABLES
#
# These system tables contain time zone information:
#
# 		time_zone: Time zone IDs and whether they use leap seconds.
#
# 		time_zone_leap_second: When leap seconds occur.
#
# 		time_zone_name: Mappings between time zone IDs and names.
#
# 		time_zone_transition,
# 		time_zone_transition_type: Time zone descriptions.
#
# REPLICATION SYSTEM TABLES
#
# The server uses these system tables to support replication:
#
# 		gtid_executed: Table for storing GTID values.
#
# 		ndb_binlog_index: Binary log information for NDB Cluster replication.
#
# 								The ndb_binlog_index table uses the MyISAM storage engine.
# 								It is created only if the server is built with NDB.
#
# 		slave_master_info, : Used to store replication information on slave servers.
# 		slave_relay_log_info,
# 		slave_worker_info 
#  
# OPTIMIZER SYSTEM TABLES
#
# These system tables are for use by the optimizer:
#
# 		innodb_index_stats, innodb_table_stats: Used for InnoDB persistent optimizer statistics.
#
# 		server_cost, engine_cost: The optimizer cost model uses tables that contain cost estimate 
# 										  information about operations that occur during query execution.
#
# 										  server_cost contains optimizer cost estimates for general server operations.
#
# 										  engine_cost contains estimates for operations specific to particular storage engines.
#
# MISC SYSTEM TABLES
#
# 		Other system tables do not fit the preceding categories:
#
# 			audit_log_filter, audit_log_user: If MySQL Enterprise Audit is installed, these tables provide persistent storage
# 														 of audit log filter defs and user accounts.
#
# 			firewall_users, firewall_whitelist: If MySQL Enterprise Firewall is installed, these tables provide persistent storage for info
# 															used by the firewall.
#
# 			servers: Used by the FEDERATED storage engine.
#
# 			innodb_dynamic_metadata: Used by the InnoDB storage engine to store fast-changing table metadata such as auto-increment counter
# 											 value and index tree corruption flags.
#
# 											 Replaces the data dictionary buffer table that resided in the InnoDB system tablespace.
#
# The following section pertains to MySQL Server Logs
#
# MySQL Server has several logs that can help you find out what activity is taking place.
#
# Log Type 					Info Written to Log
#
# Error Log 					Problems encountered starting, running or stopping mysqld
#
# General query log 			Established client connections and statements received from clients
#
# Binary log 					Statements that change data (also used for replication)
#
# Relay log 					Data changes received from a replication master server
#
# Slow query log 				Queries that took more than long_query_time seconds to execute
#
# DDL log (metadata log) 	Metadata operations performed by DDL statements
#
# By default, no logs are enabled, except the error log on Windows.
# (The DDL log is always created when required, and has no user-configurable options)
#
# The following log-specific sections provide information about the server options that enable logging.
#
# By default, the server writes files for all enabled logs in the data directory.
#
# You can force the server to close and reopen the log files (or in some cases switch to a new log file)
# by flushing the logs.
#
# Log flushing occurs when you issue a FLUSH_LOGS statement; execute mysqladmin with a flush-logs or
# or refresh argument; or execute mysqldump with a --flush-logs or --master-data option.
#
# In addition, the binary log is flushed when its size reaches the value of the max_binlog_size SYS_VAR.
#
# You can control the general query and slow query logs during runtime.
# You can enable or disable logging, or change the log file name.
#
# You can tell the server to write general query and slow query entries to log tables, log files or both.
#
# The relay log is used only on slave replication servers, to hold data changes from the master server that must
# also be made on the slave.
#
# Covered later.
#
# THE FOLLOWING PERTAINS TO SELECTING GENERAL QUERY LOG AND SLOW QUERY LOG OUTPUT DESTINATIONS
#
# MySQL Server provides flexible control over the destination of output written to the general query log and the slow query log, if those logs are enabled.
#
# Possible destinations for log entries are log files or the general_log and slow_log tables in the mysql system DB.
# File output, table output, or both can be selected.
#
# LOG CONTROL AT SERVER STARTUP
#
# The log_output system variable specifies the destination for log output. Setting this variable does not in itself enable the logs;
# they must be enabled separately.
#
# 		If log_output is not specified at startup, the default logging destination is FILE.
#
# 		If log_output is specified at startup, its value is a list one or more comma-separated words chosen from TABLE (log to tables),
# 		FILE (log to files), or NONE (do not log tables or files).
#
# 		NONE, if part of the list, has the highest precidence.
#
# The general_log SYS_VAR controls logging to the general query log for the selected log destinations.
# If specified at server startup, general_log takes an optional argument of 1 or 0 to enable or disable the log.
#
# To specify a file name other than the default for file logging, set the general_log_file variable.
#
# Similarly, the slow_query_log variable controls logging to the slow query log for the selected destinations
# and setting slow_query_log_file specifies a file name for file logging.
#
# If either log is enabled, the server opens the corresponding log file and writes startup messages to it.
#
# However, further logging of queries to the file does not occur unless the FILE log destination is selected. 
#
# Examples:
#
# 		To write general query log entries to the log table and the log file, use --log_output=TABLE,FILE to select both
# 		log destinations and --general_log to enable the general query log.
#
# 		To write general and slow query log entries only to the log tables, use --log_output=TABLE to select tables as the log
# 		destinations and --general_log and --slow_query_log to enable both logs.
#
# 		To write slow query log entries only to the log file, use --log_output=FILE to select files as the log destination and
# 		--slow_query_log to enable the slow query log. In this case, because the default log destination is FILE, you could omit the log_output setting.
#
# LOG CONTROL AT RUNTIME
#
# The system variables associated with log tables and files enable runtime control over logging:
#
# 		The log_output variable indicates the current logging destination. It can be modified at runtime to change
# 		the destination.
#
# 		The general_log and slow_query_log variables indicate whether the general query log and slow query log are enabled
# 		(ON) or disabled (OFF). You can set these variables at runtime to control whether the logs are enabled.
#
# 		The general_log_file and slow_query_log_file variables indicate the names of the general query log and slow query log files.
# 		You can set these variables at server startup or at runtime to change the names of the log files.
#
# 		To disable or enable general query logging for the current session, set the session sql_log_off variable to ON or OFF.
# 		(Assuming the general query log itself is enabled)
#
# LOG TABLE BENEFITS AND CHARACTERISTICS
#
# The use of tables for log output offers the following benefits:
#
# 		1) Log entries have a standard format. To display the current structure of the log tables, use these statements:
#
# 				SHOW CREATE TABLE mysql.general_log;
# 				SHOW CREATE TABLE mysql.slow_log;
#
# 		2) Log contents are accessible through SQL statements. This enables the use of queries that selects only those log entries
# 			that satisfy specific criteria.
#
# 			For example, to select log contents associated with a particular client (which can be useful for identifying problematic
# 			queries from that client), it is easier to do this using a log table than a log file.
#
# 		3) Logs are accessible remotely through any client that can connect to the server and issue queries (if the client has the appropiate
# 			log table privileges). It is not necessary to log in to the server host and directly access the file system.
#
# The log table implementation has the following characteristics:
#
# 		1) In general, the primary purpose of log tables is to provide an interface for users to observe the runtime execution of the server,
# 			not to interfere with its runtime execution.
#
# 		2) CREATE_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE and DROP_TABLE are valid operations on a log table. 
# 			For ALTER_TABLE and DROP_TABLE, the log table cannot be in use and must be disabled.
#
# 		3) By default, the log tables use the CSV storage engine that writes data in comma-separated values format.
#
# 			For users who have access to the .CSV files that contain log table data, the files are easy to import into
# 			other programs such as spreadsheets that can process CSV input.
#
# 			The log tables can be altered to use the MyISAM storage engine. You cannot use ALTER_TABLE to alter a log table
# 			that is in use.
#
# 			The log must be disabled first. No engines other than CSV or MyISAM are legal for the log tables.
#
# 				Log Tables and "Too many open files" Errors: If you select TABLE a log destination and the log tables use the CSV storage engine,
# 																			you may find that disabling and enabling the general query log or slow query log repeatedly at runtime
# 																			can open a number of open file descriptors for the .CSV file, possibly resulting in a "Too many open files" error.
#
# 																			To work around this issue, execute FLUSH_TABLES or ensure that the value of open_files_limit is greater than
# 																			the value of table_open_cache_instances.
#
# 		4) To disable logging so that you can alter (or drop) a log table, you can use the following strategy.
# 			The example uses the general query log; the procedure for the slow query log is similar but uses the slow_log table
# 			and slow_query_log SYS_VAR.
#
# 				SET @old_log_state = @@GLOBAL.general_log;
# 				SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';
# 				ALTER TABLE mysql.general_log ENGINE = MyISAM;
# 				SET GLOBAL general_log = @old_log_state;
#
# 		5) TRUNCATE_TABLE is a valid operation on a log table. It can be used to expire log entries.
#
# 		6) RENAME_TABLE is a valid operation on a log table. You can automatically rename a log table (to perform log rotation, for example)
# 			using the following strategy:
#
# 			USE mysql;
# 			DROP TABLE IF EXISTS general_log2;
# 			CREATE TABLE general_log2 LIKE general_log;
# 			RENAME TABLE general_log TO general_log_backup, general_log2 TO general_log;
#
# 		7) CHECK_TABLE is a valid operation on a log table.
#
# 		8) LOCK_TABLES cannot be used on a log table.
#
# 		9) INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE cannot be used on a log table. These operations are permitted only internally to the server itself.
#
# 		10) FLUSH_TABLES_WITH_READ/LOCK and the state of the read_only SYS_VAR have no effect on log tables.
# 			 The server can always write to the log tables.
#
# 		11) Entries written to the log tables are not written to the binary log and thus are not replicated to slave servers.
#
# 		12) To flush the log tables or log files, use FLUSH_TABLES or FLUSH_LOGS, respectively.
#
# 		13) Partitioning of log tables is not permitted.
#
# 		14) A mysqldump dump includes statements to recreate those tables so that they are not missing after reloading the dump file. Log table contents are not dumped.
#
# The following section pertains to The Error Log:
#
# This section discusses how to configure the MySQL server for logging of diagnostic messages to the error log.
# For information about selecting the error message character set or language - it is covered later.
#
# The error log contains a record of mysqld startup and shutdown times.
#
# It also contains diagnostic messages such as errors, warnings and notes that occur during
# server startup and shutdown, and while the server is running. 
#
# For example, if mysqld notices that a table needs to be automatically checked or repaired, it writes
# a message to the error log.
#
# On some OS's the error log contains a stack trace if mysqld exits abnormally.
#
# The trace can be used to determine where mysqld exited.
#
# If used to start mysqld, mysqld_safe may write messages to the error log.
#
# For example, when mysqld_safe notices abnormal mysqld exits, it restarts mysqld
# and writes a mysqld restarted message to the error log.
#
# The following sections are configurations of error logging.
#
# The following section covers Error Log Component Configuration:
#
# In MySQL 8.0, error logging uses the MySQL component architechture since before.
#
# The error log subsystem consists of components that perform log event filter and writing,
# as well as a system variable that configures which components to enable to achieve the desired logging result.
#
# This section is for selecting components for error logging.
# For instructions specific to the system log and JSON log writers - it is covered later.
#
# Component-based error logging offers these features:
#
# 		Log events can be filtered by filter components to affect the information available for writing.
#
# 		Log events are output by sink (writer) components. Multiple sink components can be enabled, to write error log output to multiple destinations.
#
# 		Built-in filter and writer components combine to implement the default error logging format.
#
# 		A loadable writer enables logging to the system log.
#
# 		A loadable writer enables logging in JSON format.
#
# 		System variables control which log components to enable and the rules for filtering log events.
#
# The log_error_services SYS_VAR controls which log components to enable for error logging.
# The variable may contain a list with 0,1 or many elements.
#
# In the latter case, elements may be delimieted by ; or , (>= MySQL 8.0.12), optionally followed by a space.
#
# A given setting cannot use both semicolon and comma separators.
#
# Component order is significant because the server executes components in the order listed.
#
# By default, log_error_services has this  value:
#
# 		SELECT @@GLOBAL.log_error_services;
# 		+---------------------------------------+
# 		| @@GLOBAL.log_error_services 	  		 |
# 		+---------------------------------------+
# 		| log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal|
# 		+---------------------------------------+
#
# That value indicates that log events first pass through the built-in filter component, log_filter_internal,
# then through the built-in log writer component, log_sink_internal.
#
# A filter modifies log events seen by components named later in the log_error_services value.
# A sink is a destination for log events. 
#
# Typically, a sink processes log events into log messages that have a particular format and writes these
# messages to its associated output, such as file or the system log.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		If log_error_services is assigned a value that contains no writer components, no log output is written from that point.
#
# 		The final component in the log_error_services value should be a writer. If the final component is a filter, it has no effect
# 		because the filtered events are not sent to any writer.
#
# The combination of log_filter_internal and log_sink_internal implements the default error log filtering and output behavior.
# The action of these components is affected by other server options and system variables:
#
# 		1) The output destination is determined by the --log-error option (and, on Windows --pid-file and --console).
# 			These determine whether to write error messages to the console or a file and - if to a file - the error log file name.
#
# 		2) The log_error_verbosity SYS_VAR affects which types of log events log_filter_internal permits or suppresses.
#
# To change the set of log components used for error logging, load components as necessary and modify the log_error_services value.
#
# Adding or removing log components is subject to these constraints:
#
# 		3) To enable a log component, first load it using INSTALL_COMPONENT (unless it is built in or already loaded), then list the component in the
# 			log_error_service value.
#
# 			For a component to be permitted in the log_error_services value - it must be known.
#
# 		 	A component is known by default if it is built in or if it is loadable and has been loaded
# 			using INSTALL_COMPONENT.
#
# 			Attempts to name an unknown component at server startup cause log_error_services to be set to its default value.
# 			Attempts to name an unknown component at runtime produces an error and the log_error_services value remains unchanged.
#
# 		4) To disable a log component, remove it from the log_error_services value. Then, if the component is loadable and you also
# 			want to unload it, use UNINSTALL COMPONENT.
#
# 			Attempts to use UNINSTALL_COMPONENT to unload a loadable component that is still named in the log_error_services value produces an error.
#
# For example, to use the system log writer (log_sink_syseventlog) instead of the default writer (log_sink_internal) - first load the writer component,,
# then modify the log_error_services values:
#
# 		INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_syseventlog';
# 		SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_syseventlog';
#
# NOTE: 
#
# 		The URN to use for loading a log component with INSTALL_COMPONENT is the component name prefixed with file://component_
#
# 		For example, for the log_sink_syseventlog component, the corresponding URN is file://component_log_sink_syseventlog
#
# It is possible to configure multiple log writers to send output to multiple destinations.
#
# To enable the sys log writer in addition to (rather than instead of) the default writer - set the log_error_services as:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal; log_sink_syseventlog';
#
# To revert to using only the default writer and unload the system log writer, execute these statements:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal;
# 		UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_syseventlog';
#
# To configure a log component to be enabled at each server startup, use this procedure:
#
# 		1) If the component is loadable, load it using INSTALL_COMPONENT. Loading the component registers it in the mysql.component
# 			system table that the server loads it automatically for subsequent startups.
#
# 		2) Set the log_error_services value at startup to include the component name.
#
# 			Set the value either in the server my.cnf file, or use SET_PERSIST - which sets the value for for the running MySQL instance
# 			and also saves the value to be used for subsequent server restarts.
#
# 			A value set in my.cnf takes effect at the next restart. A value set using SET_PERSIST takes effect immediately and for subsequent restarts.
#
# Suppose that you want to configure, for every server startup, use of the JSON log writer (log_sink_json) in addition to the built-in log filter and
# writer (log_filter_internal, log_sink_internal).
#
# First load the JSON Writer if it is not loaded:
#
# INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_json';
#
# Then set log_error_services to take effect at server startup. You can set it in my.cnf:
#
# [mysqld]
# log_error_services='log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal; log_sink_json'
#
# Or you can set it using SET_PERSIST:
#
# SET PERSIST log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal; log_sink_json';
#
# The order of components named in log_error_services is significant, particularly with respect to the 
# relative order of filters and writers. Consider this log_error_services value:
#
# log_filter_internal; log_sink_1; log_sink_2
#
# In this case, log events pass to the built-in filter, then to the first writer, then to the second writer.
# Both writers receive filtered log events.
#
# Compare that to this log_error_services value:
#
# 		log_sink_1; log_filter_internal; log_sink_2
#
# In this case, the only is only applied to the output before being piped to the second writer.
# i.e, sink_1 is unfiltered, sink_2 is filtered.
#
# The following section pertains to DEFAULT ERROR LOG DESTINATION CONFIGURATION
#
# This section discusses which server options configure the default error log destination, which can be the console 
# or a named file.
#
# It also indicates which log writer components base their own output destination on the default destination.
#
# In this discussion, "console" means stderr, the standard error output.
#
# This is your terminal or console window unless the standard error output has been redirected.
#
# The server interprets options that determine the default error log destination somewhat differently for Windows and Unix systems.
# Be sure to configure the destination using the information appropiate to your OS.
#
# After the server interprets the default error log destination options, it sets the log_error SYS_VAR to indicate the default destination,
# which affects where several log writer components writer error messages.
#
# The following section pertains to Default Error Log Destination on Windows
#
# On Windows, mysqld uses the --log-error, --pid-file and --console options to determine whether the default error log destination
# is the console or a file and if a file , the file name:
#
# 		If --console is given, the default destination is the console (--console takes precedence over --log-error if both are given, and the following
# 																							items regarding --log-error do not apply)
#
# 		If --log-error is not given, or is given without naming a file, the default destination is a file named <host_name.err> in the data directory,
# 		unless the --pid-file option is specified. In that case, the file name is the PID file base name with a suffix of .err in the data dir.
#
# 		If --log-error is given to name a file, the default destination is that file (with an .err suffix added if the name has no suffix), located
# 		under the data directory unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different location.
#
# If the default error log destination is the console, the server sets the log_error SYS_VAR to stderr.
# Otherwise, the default destination is a file and the server sets log_error to the file name.
#
# The following pertains to Default Error Log Destination on Unix and Unix-Like Systems
#
# On Unix and Unix-like systems, mysqld uses the --log-error option to determine whether the default error log destination
# is the console or a file - and, if a file - the file name
#
# 		If --log-error is not given, the default destination is the console.
#
# 		If --log-error is given without naming a file, the default destination is a file named <host_name.err> in the data dir.
#
# 		If --log-error is given to name a file, the default destination is that file (with an .err suffix added if the name has no suffix),
# 		located under the data dir unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different location.
#
# 		If --log-error is given an option file in a [mysqld], [server], or [mysqld_safe] section, mysqld_safe finds and uses the option, and passes it to mysqld.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				It is common for Yum or APT package installations to configure an error log file location under /var/log with an option like log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
# 				in a server configuration file.
#
# 				Removing the file name from the option causes the <host_name.err> file in the data directory to be used.
#
# If the default error log destination is the console, the server sets the log_error SYS_VAR to stderr. Otherwise, the default destination is a file and
# the server sets log_error to the file name.
#
# HOW THE DEFAULT ERROR LOG DESTINATION AFFECTS LOG WRITERS
#
# After the server interprets the error log destination configuration options, it sets the log_error SYS_VAR to indicate the
# default error log destination.
#
# Log writer components may base their own output destination on the log_error value, or determine their destination independently of log_error.
#
# If log_error is stderr, the default error log destination is the console, and log writers that base their output destination also write to the
# console:
#
# 		log_sink_internal, log_sink_json, log_sink_test: These writers write to the console.
#
# 																		 This is true even for writers such as log_sink_json that can be enabled multiple times; all instances write to the console.
#
# 		log_sink_syseventlog: This writer writes to the system log, regardless of the log_error value.
#
# If log_error is not stderr, the default error log destination is a file and log_error indicates the file name.
#
# Log writers that base their output destination on the default destination base output file naming on that file name.
#
# (A writer might use exactly that name, or it might use some variant thereof). Suppose that the log_error value <file_name>.
# Then log writers use the name like this:
#
# 		log_sink_internal, log_sink_test: These writers write to <file_name>
#
# 		log_sink_json: Successive instances of this writer named in the log_error_services value 	write to files named <file_name> plus a numbered .<NN>.json suffix:
#			
# 			<file_name>.00.json, <file_name>.01.json and so forth
#
# 		log_sink_syseventlog: This writer writes to the system log, regardless of the log_error value.
#
# The following section pertains to the Error Logging to the System Log
#
# It is possible to have mysqld write the error log to the system log (the Event Log on Windows, and syslog on Unix and Unix-like systems)
#
# This section describes how to configure error logging using the built-in filter, log_filter_internal, and the system log writer,
# log_sink_syseventlog - to take effect immediately and for subsequent server startups.
#
# To enable the system log writer, first load the writer component, then modify the log_error_services value:
#
# 		INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_syseventlog';
# 		SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_syseventlog';
#
# To set log_error_services to take effect at server startup - use earlier sectioning desc.
#
# Those instructions apply to other error-logging SYS_VARs as well.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		For MySQL 8.0 configuration, you must enable error logging to the system log explicitly.
#
# 		This differs from 5.7 MySQL and earlier, for which error logging to the sys log is enabled by default on Windows,
# 		and on all platforms requires no component loading.
#
# 		Error logging to the system log may require additional SYS_CONFIG.
#
# On Windows, error messages written to the Event Log within the Application log have these characteristics:
#
# 		Entries marked as Error, Warning, and Note are written to the Event Log, but not messages such as information statements from
# 		individual storage engines.
#
# 		Event Log entries have a source of MySQL (or MySQL-<tag> if syseventlog.tag is defined as <tag>)
#
# On Unix and Unix-like systems, logging to the system log uses syslog.
# The following SYS_VARs affect syslog messages:
#
# 		syseventlog.facility - The default facility for syslog messages is daemon. Set this variable to specify a different facility.
#
# 		syseventlog.include_pid - Whether to include the server process ID in each line of syslog output.
#
# 		syseventlog.tag - This variable defines a tag to add to the server identifier (mysqld) in syslog messages.
# 								If defined, the tag is appended to the identifier with a leading hyphen.
#
# 			NOTE: Prior to MySQL 8.0.13, use the log_syslog_facility, log_syslog_include_pid and log_syslog_tag SYS_VAR rather than
# 					the syseventlog.<xxx> variables.
#
# MySQL uses the custom label "System" for important system messages about non-error situations, such as startup, shutdown and some significant
# changes to settings.
#
# In logs that do not support custom labels, including the Event Log on Windows, and syslog on Unix and Unix-like systems, system messages
# are assigned the label used for the information level of severity.
#
# However, these messages are printed to the log even if the MySQL log_error_verbosity setting would normally exclude
# messages at the information level.
#
# When a log writer must fall back to a label of "Information" instead of "System" in this way, and the log event is further
# processed outside of the MySQL server (for example, filtered or forwarded by a syslog configuration), these events may
# by default be processed by the secondary application as being of "Information" severity rather than "System" severity.
#
# The following section pertains to Error Logging in JSON Format:
#
# This section describes how to configure error logging using the built-in filter, log_filter_internal, and the JSON writer, log_sink_json to take
# effect immediately and  for subsequent server startups.
#
# To enable the JSON writer, first load the writer component, then modify the log_error_services value:
#
# 		INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_json';
# 		SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_json';
#
# It is permitted to name log_sink_json multiple times in the log_error_services value.
#
# For example, to write unfiltered events with one instance and filtered events with another instance,
# you could set log_error_services like this:  		
#
# 		SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_sink_json; log_filter_internal; log_sink_json';
#
# The JSON log writer determines its output destination based on the default error log destination, which is given by
# the log_error SYS_VAR.
#
# If log_error names a file, the JSON writer bases output file naming on that file name, plus a numbered .<NN>.json suffix,
# with <NN> starting at 00.
#
# For example, if log_error is <file_name> - successive instances of log_sink_json named in the log_error_services value 
# write to <file_name>.00.json, <file_name>.01.json and so forth.
#
# If log_error is stderr, the JSON writer writes to the console.
#
# If log_json_writer is named multiple times in the log_error_services value, they all write
# to the console which is likely not useful.
#
# The following section pertains to Error Log Filtering:
#
# Error log configuration normally includes one log filter component and one or more log writer component.
# For error log filtering, MySQL offers a choice of components:
#
# 		log_filter_internal: This filter component provides error log filtering based on log event prio, in combination with
# 									the log_error_verbosity SYS_VAR.
#
# 									log_filter_internal is built in and enabled by default.
#
# 		log_filter_dragnet: 	This filter component provides error log filtering based on user-supplied rules, in combination
# 									with the dragnet.log_error_filter_rules SYS_VAR.
#
# log_filter_internal: Priority-Based Error Log Filtering
#
# 		Error log verbosity control is a simple form of log filtering based on error event prio.
# 		It is implemented by the log_filter_internal log filter component.
#
# 		To affect how log_filter_internal is built in and enabled by default, but if disabled, changes to log_error_verbosity has no effect.
#
# 		Permitted log_error_verbosity values are 1 (errors only), 2 (errors and warnings), 3 (errors, warnings and notes)
#
# 		If log_error_verbosity is set to >= 2, the server logs messages about statements that are unsafe for statement-based logging.
# 		If the value is 3, the server logs aborted connections and access-denied errors for new connection attempts.
#
# 		If you use replication, setting log_error_verbosity to >= 2 is recommended, to get more info about what is happening, such as messages
# 		about network failures and reconnections.
#
# 		If a slave server has log_error_verbosity >= 2, the slave prints messages to the error log to provide information about its status, such as
# 		the binary log and relay log coordinates where it starts its job, when it is switching to another relay log, when it reconnects after a DC, etc.
#
# 		Selected important system messages about non-error situations are printed to the error log regardless of the log_error_verbosity value.
# 		These messages include startup and shutdown messages, and some significant changes to settings.
#
# 		In the MySQL error log, system messages are labeled as "System". Other log writers might or might not follow the same convention,
# 		and in the resulting logs, system messages might be assigned the label used for the information level of severity, such as "Note"
# 		or "Information".
#
#		If you apply any additional filtering or redirection for logging based on the labeling of messages, system messages do not override
# 		your filter, but are handeled by it in the same way as other messages.
#
# log_filter_dragnet: Rule-Based Error Log Filtering
#
#		The log_filter_dragnet log filter component enables log filtering based on user-defined rules.
# 		To define the applicable rules, set the dragnet.log_error_filter_rules SYS_VAR.
#
# 		To enable the log_filter_dragnet filter, first load the filter component, then modify the log_error_services value.
# 		The following example enables log_filter_dragnet in combination with the built-in log writer:
#
# 			INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_filter_dragnet';
# 			SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_dragnet; log_sink_internal';
#
# 		To set log_error_services to take effect at server startup, see earlier notes.
#
# 		With log_filter_dragnet enabled, define its filter rules by setting the dragnet.log_error_filter_rules SYS_VAR.
# 		A rule set consists of zero or more rules, where each rule is an IF statement terminated by a period (.) char.
#
# 		If the var value is empty (zero rules), no filtering occurs.
#
# 		Example 1.
#
# 			This rule set drops information events, and, for other events, removes the source_line field:
#
# 				SET GLOBAL dragnet.log_error_filter_rules = 
# 					'IF prio>=INFORMATION THEN drop. IF EXISTS source_line THEN unset source_line.';
#
# 			This effect is similar to the filtering performed by the log_sink_internal filter with a setting of
# 			log_error_verbosity=2
#
# 		Example 2.
#
# 			This rule limits information events to no more than one per 60 seconds:
#
# 				SET GLOBAL dragnet.log_error_filter_rules = 
# 					'IF prio>=INFORMATION THEN throttle 1/60.';
#
# Once you have the filtering configuration set up, consider assignment dragnet.log_error_filter_rules using SET_PERSIST rather than
# the SET_GLOBAL to make the setting persist across server restarts.
#
# Alternatively, add the setting to the server option file.
#
# To stop using the filtering language, first remove it from the set of error logging components. Usually this means using a
# different filter component rather than no filter component.
#
# For example:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal';
#
# Again, consider using SET_PERSIST rather than SET_GLOBAL to make the settings persist across server restarts.
#
# Then uninstall the filter log_filter_dragnet component:
#
# 		UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_filter_dragnet';
#
# THe following section describes aspects of log_filter_dragnet operation in more detail:
#
# 		log_filter_dragnet Rule language
#
# 		log_filter_dragnet Rule Actions
#
# 		log_filter_dragnet Rule Fields
#
# log_filter_dragnet Rule Language
#
# The following grammar defines the language for log_filter_dragnet filter rules.
# Each rule is an IF statement terminated by a (.) char.
#
# The language is not case sensitive:
#
# rule:
# 		IF condition THEN action
# 		[ELSEIF condition THEN action] ...
# 		[ELSE action]
#
# condition: 	{
# 		drop
# 	| throttle {count | count / window_size}
# 	| set field [:= | =] value
# 	| unset [field]
# }
#
# field: {
# 		core_field
# 	| optional_field
# 	| user_defined_field
# }
#
# 
# core_field: {
# 		time
# 	| msg
# 	| prio
# 	| label
# 	| err_code
# 	| err_symbol
# 	| SQL_state
# 	| subsystem
# }
#
# optional_field: {
# 		OS_errno
# 	 | OS_errmsg
# 	 | user
# 	 | host
# 	 | thread
# 	 | query_id
# 	 | source_file
# 	 | source_line
# 	 | function
# }
#
# user_defined_field:
# 		sequence of characters in [a-zA-Z0-9_] class
#
# comparator: {== | != | <> | >= | => | <= | =< | < | >}
#
# value: {
# 		string_literal
# 	 | integer_literal
# 	 | float_literal
# 	 | error_symbol
# 	 | severity
# }
#
# count: integer_literal
# window_size: integer_literal
#
# string_literal:
# 		sequence of characters quoted as '...' or "..."
#
# integer_literal:
# 		sequence of characters in [0-9] class
#
# float_literal:
# 		integer_literal[.integer_literal]
#
# error_symbol:
# 		valid MySQL error symbol such as ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR or ER_STARTUP
#
# severity: {
# 		ERROR
# 	 | WARNING
# 	 | INFORMATION
# }
#
# Simple conditions compare a field to a value or test field existence.
# To construct more complex conditions, use the AND and OR operators.
#
# Both operators have the same precedence and evaluate left to right.
#
# To escape a character within a string, precede it with \.
# A backslash is required to include \ or the string-quoting char, optional for othe chars.
#
# For convenience, log_filter_dragnet supports symbolic names for comparisons to certain fields.
# Where applicable, symbols are preferable to numeric - for readability and portability.
#
# 		) Event severity values 1,2 and 3 can be specified as ERROR, WARNING , and INFORMATION.
# 		  Severity symbols are recognized only in comparisons with the prio field.
#
# 		  These comparisons are equivalent:
#
# 				IF prio == INFORMATION THEN ...
# 				IF prio == 3 THEN ...

# 		) Error codes can be specified in numeric form or as the corresponding error symbol.
#
# 		  For example, ER_STARTUP is the symbolic name for error 1408, so these comparisons are eqv.:
#
# 				IF err_code == ER_STARTUP THEN ...
# 				IF err_code == 1408 THEN ...
#
# Error symbols are recognized only in comparisons with the err_code field and user-defined fields.
#
# To find hte error symbol corresponding to a given error code number:
#
# 		Use the perror command, which when given an error number argument, displays info about the error, including its symbol.
#
# Suppose that a rule set with error numbers looks like this:
#
# 		IF err_code == 10927 OR err_code == 10914 THEN drop.
# 		If err_code == 1131 THEN drop.
#
# Using perror, determine the error symbols:
#
# 		perror 10927 10914 1131
# 		MySQL error code MY-010927 (ER_ACCESS_DENIED_FOR_USER_ACCOUNT_LOCKED)::
# 		Access denied for user '%-.48s'@'%-.64s'. Account is locked.
# 		MySQL error code MY-010914 (ER_ABORTING_USER_CONNECTION):
# 		Aborted connection %u to db: '%-.192s' user: '%-.48s' host:
# 		'%-.64s' (%-.64s).
# 		MySQL error code MY-001131 (ER_PASSWORD_ANONYMOUS_USER):
# 		You are using MySQL as an anonymous user and anonymous users are not allowed to change PWs.
#
# Substituting error symbols for numbers, the rule set becomes:
#
# 		IF err_code == ER_ACCESS_DENIED_FOR_USER_ACCOUNT_LOCKED
# 			OR err_code == ER_ABORTING_USER_CONNECTION THEN drop.
# 		IF err_code == ER_PASSWORD_ANONYMOUS_USER THEN drop.
#
# Symbolic names can be specified as quoted strings for comparison with string fields, but in such cases
# the names are strings that have no special meaning and log_filter_dragnet does not resolve them to
# the corresponding numeric value.
#
# Also, typos may go undetected, whereas an error is thrown immediately on SET for attempts to use an unquoted
# symbol unknown to the server.
#
# LOG_FILTER_DRAGNET RULE ACTIONS
#
# log_filter_dragnet supports these actions in filter rules:
#
# 		drop: Drop the current log event (do not log it)
#
# 		throttle: apply rate limiting to reduce log verbosity for events matching particular conditions.
# 					 The argument indicates a rate, in the form <count> or <count>/<window_size>.
#
# 					The <count> value indicates the permitted number of events to log per time window.
# 					The <window_size> value is the time window in seconds; if omitted, the default window is 60 seconds.
#
# 					Both values must be integer literals.
#
# 					This rule throttles plugin-shutdown messages to 5/60 sec:
#
# 						IF err_code == ER_PLUGIN_SHUTTING_DOWN_PLUGIN THEN throttle 5.
#
# 					This rule throttles errors and warnings to 1000/hour and information messages to 100/hour:
#
# 						IF prio <= INFORMATION THEN throttle 1000/3600 ELSE throttle 100/3600.
#
# 		set: Assign a value to a field (and cause the field to exist if it did not already).
# 			  In subsequent rules, EXISTS tests against the field name are true, and the new value can
# 			  be tested by comparison conditions.
#
# 		unset: Discard a field. In subsequent rules, EXISTS tests against hte field name are false and comparisons of the field against
# 				 any value are false.
#
# 				 In the case that the condition refers to exactly one field name, the field name following unset is optional and
# 				 unset discards the named field..
#
# 				 These rules are equivalent:
#
# 						IF myfield == 2 THEN unset myfield.
# 						IF myfield == 2 THEN unset.
#
# LOG_FILTER_DRAGNET RULE FIELDS
#
# 		log_filter_dragnet supports core, optional and user-defined fields in rules:
#
# 			1) A core field is set up automatically for error events. However, its presence in the event is not guaranteed because
# 			a core field, like any type of field, may be unset by filter rules.
#
# 			If so, the field will be found missing by later rules within the rule set and by components that execute after the filter (such as log writers)
#
# 			2) An optional field is normally absent but may be present for certain event types. When present, an optional field provides additional event 
# 				information as appropriate and available.
#
# 			3) A user-defiend field is any field with a name that is not already defined as a core or optional field.
# 				A user-defined label does not exist until created with the <set> action.
#
# 		As implied by the preceding desc., any given field may be absent, either because it was not present or discarded by a filtering rule.
#
# 		For log writers, the effect of field absence is writer specific. For example, a writer might omit the field from the log message,
# 		indicate that the field is missing or substitute a default.
#
# 		When in doubt, use a filter rule to unset the field, then check what the log writer does with it.
#
# 		These fields are core fields:
#
# 			time
#
# 				The event timestamp
#
# 			msg
#
# 				THe event message string
#
# 			prio
#
# 				The event priority, to indicate error, warning or note/information event. This field corresponds to severity in syslog.
#
# 				In comparisons, each prio can be specified as a symbolic severity name or an integer literal.
# 				Severity symbols are recognized only in comparisons with the prio field.
#
# 				These comparisons are equivalent:
#
# 					IF prio == INFORMATION THEN ...
# 					IF prio == 3 THEN ...
#
# 				The prio levels are:
#
# 					Error events: 1, Warning events: 2, Note/information events: 3
#
# 				Prio values follow hte principle that higher prios have lower values, and vice versa.
# 				Prio values begin at 1 for the most severe events (errors) and increase for events with decreasing severity.
#
# 				For example, to discard events with lower prio than warnings, test for prio values higher than WARNING:
#
# 					IF prio > WARNING THEN drop.
#
# 				The following shows the log_filter_dragnet rules to achieve an effect similar to each log_error_verbosity
# 				value permitted by the log_filter_internal filter:
#
# 					Errors only (log_error_verbosity=1):
#
# 						IF prio > ERROR THEN drop.
#
# 					Errors and Warnings (log_error_verbosity=2):
# 
# 						IF prio > WARNING THEN drop.
#
# 					Errors, warnings and notes (log_error_verbosity=3):
#
# 						IF prio > INFORMATION THEN drop.
#
# 					This rule can actually be omitted because it drops nothing.
#
# err_code
#
# 		The numeric event error code. In comparisons, the value to test can be specified as a symbolic error name or an 
# 		integer literal.
#
# 		Error symbols are recognized only in comparisons with the err_code field and user-defined roles.
#
# 		These comparisons are equal:
#
# 			IF err_code == ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR THEN ...
# 			IF err_code == 1045 THEN ...
#
# err_symbol
#
# 		The event error symbol, as a string; for example, 'ER_DUP_KEY'
#
# 		err_symbol values are intended more for identifying particular lines in log output than for use in filter
# 		rule comparisons because log_filter_dragnet does not resolve comparison values specified as strings to the equivalent numeric error codes.
#
# SQL_state
#
# 		The event SQLSTATE value, as a string, for example '23000'
#
# subsystem
#
# 		The subsystem in which the event occurred. Possible values are InnoDB (the InnoDB storage engine), 
# 		Repl (the replication subsystem), Server (otherwise)
#
# OPtional fields fall into the following categories:
#
# 		Additional information about the error, such as the error signaled by the OS or the error lable:
#
# 			OS_errno
#
# 				The OS error number
#
# 			OS_errmsg
#
# 				The OS error message
#
# 			label
#
# 				The label corresponding to the prio value, as a string.
# 				Filter rules can change the label for log writers that support custom labels.
#
# 				label values are intended more for identifying parituclar lines in log output than
# 				for use in filter rule comparisons because log_filter_dragnet does not resolve
# 				comparison values specified as strings to the equivalent Numeric Prio.
#
# Identification of the client for which the event occurred:
#
# 		user
# 			The client User
#
# 		host
# 			The client host
#
# 		thread
# 			The thread ID
#
# 		query_id
# 			The query ID
#
# Debugging information:
#
# 		source_file
#
# 			The source file in which the event occurred. The file name should omit any leading path.
# 			For example, to test for the sql/gis/distance.cc file, write the comparison like this:
#
# 				IF source_file == "distance.cc" THEN ...
#
# 		source_line
#
# 			The line within the source file at which the event occurred
#
# 		function
#
# 			The function in which the event occurred.
#
# 		component
#
# 			The component or plugin in which the event occurred.
#
# The following pertains to ERROR LOG MESSAGE FORMAT
#
# Each error log sink (writer) component has a characteristic output format it uses to write messages to its destination,
# but other factors may influence the content of the messages:
#
# 			) The information available to the log writer.
#
# 			  If a log filter component executed prior to execution of the writer component removes a log event attribute,
# 			  that attribute is not available for writing.
#
# 			) System variables that may affect log writers.
#
# For all log writers, the ID included in error log messages is that of the thread within mysqld responsible for writing the message.
#
# This indicates which part of the server produced the message, and consistent with general query log and slow query log messages, which include
# the connection thread ID. 
#
# OUTPUT FORMAT FOR LOG_SINK_INTERNAL
#
# This log writer produces the traditional error log output. It writes messages using this format:
#
# 		timestamp thread_id [severity] [err_code] [subsystem] message
#
# The [] are literal chars in the message format, it does not indicate optional.
#
# The [err_code] and [subsystem] fields were added in MySQL 8.0.
# THey will be missing from logs generated by older servers.
#
# Log parsers can treat these fields as parts of the message text that will present only for logs written by servers
# recent enough to include them.
#
# Parsers must treat the err_code part of [err_code] indicators as a string value.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		2018-03-22T12:35:47.... 0 [Note] [MY-012487] [InnoDB] InnoDB: DDL log recovery : begin
# 		2018-03-22T12:35:47.... 0 [Warning] [MY-010068] [Server] CA certificate /var/mysql/sslinfo/cacert.pem is self signed.
# 		2018-03-22T12:35:47.... 4 [Note] [MY-010051] [Server] Event Scheduler: scheduler thread started with id 4
# 		2018-03-22T12:35:47.... 0 [Note] [MY-010253] [Server] IPv6 is available.
#
# OUTPUT FORMAT FOR LOG_SINK_JSON
#
# The JSON-format log writer produces messages as JSON objects that contain key/value pairs. For example:
#
#  { 	"prio": 3, "err_code": 10051, "subsystem": "Server",
# 		"source_file": "event_scheduler.cc", "function": "run",
# 		"msg": "Event Scheduler: scheduler thread started with id 4",
# 		"time": "2018-03-22T12:35:47....", "thread": 4,
# 		"err_symbol": "ER_SCHEDULER_STARTED", "SQL_state": "HY000",
# 		"label": "Note" }
#
# OUTPUT FORMAT FOR LOG_SINK_SYSEVENTLOG
#
# The system log writer produces output that conforms to the system log format used on the local platform.
#
# OUTPUT FORMAT FOR EARLY-STARTUP LOGGING
#
# The server generates some error log messages before startup options have been processed,
# and thus before it knows error log settings such as the log_error_verbosity and log_timestamps values,
# and which log components are to be used.
#
# The server handles error log messages that are generated early in the startup process as follows:
#
# 		) Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, the server generates messages with the default timestamp, format and verbosity level, and buffers them.
# 	     After the startup options are processed and the error log configuration is known, the server flushes the buffered messages.
#
# 		  Because these early messages use the default log configuration, they may differ from what is specified by the startup options.
# 		  Also, the early messages are not flushed to log writers other than the default.
#
# 		  For example, logging to the JSON writer does not include these messages because they are not in JSON format.
#
# 		) As of MySQL 8.0.14, the server buffer log events rather than formatted log messages.
# 		  This enables it to retroactively apply configuration settings to those events after hte settings are known,
# 		  with the result that flushed messages use the configured settings, not the defaults.
#
# 		  Also messages are flushed to all configured writers, not just the default writer.
#
# 		  If a fatal error occurs before log configuration is known and the server must exit, the server so they are not lost.
#
# 		  If no fatal error occurs but startup is excessively slow prior to processing startup options, the server
# 		  periodically formats and flushes buffered messages using the logging defaults so as not to appear unresponsive.
#
# 		  Although these behaviors are similar to pre-8.0.14 in that the defaults are used, they are preferable to losing messages
# 		  when exceptional conditions occur.
#
# Sytem variables That affect error log format
#
# The log_timestamps SYS_VAR controls the time zone of timestamps in messages written to the error log
# (as well as to general query log and slow query log files).
#
# Permitted values are UTC (The default), and SYSTEM(local system time zone)
#
# The following section pertains to ERROR LOG FILE FLUSHING AND RENAMING
#
# If you flush the error log using FLUSH_ERROR_LOGS, FLUSH_LOGS or mysqladmin flush-logs, the server closes
# and reopens any error log file to which it is writing.
#
# To rename an error log file, do so manually before flushing.
# Flushing the logs then opens a new file with the original file name.
#
# For example, assuming a log file name of <host_name>.err - to rename the file and create a new one,
# use the following commands:
#
# 		mv host_name.err host_name.err-old
# 		mysqladmin flush-logs
# 		mv host_name.err-old backup-directory
#
# On windows, use rename rather than MV.
#
# If the location of an error log file is not writable by the server, the log-flushing ops fail to 
# create a new log file.
#
# For example, on Linux, the server might write hte error log to the /var/log/mysqld.log file, where the
# /var/log directory is owned by root and is not writable by mysqld.
#
# If the server is not writing to a named error log file, no error log file renaming occurs when the error log is flushed.
#
# The following Chapter pertains to THE GENERAL QUERY LOG
#
# The general query log is a general record of what mysqld is doing.
# The server writes information to this log when clients connect or disconnect, and it logs each SQL
# statement received from clients.
#
# The general query log can be very useful when you suspect an error in a client and want to know exactly what
# the client sent to mysqld.
#
# Each line that shows when a client connects also includes using <connection_type> to indicate the protocol used
# to establish the connection.
#
# <connection_type> is one of:
#
#		 TCP/IP (TCP/IP connection established without SSL)
# 		 SSL/TLS (TCP/IP established with SSL),
# 		 Socket (Unix socket file connection)
# 		 Named pipe (Windows named pipe)
# 		 Shared memory (Windows shared memory connection)
#
# mysqld writes statements to the query log in the order that it receives them, which might differ from the order
# in which they are executed.
#
# This logging order is in contrast with that of the binary log, for which statements are written after they are
# executed but before any locks are released.
#
# In addition, the query log may contain statements that only select data while such statements are never written to the binary log..
#
# When using statement-based binary logging on a replication master server, statements received by its slaves are written to the query
# log of each slave.
#
# Statements are written to the query log of the master service if a client reads events with the mysqlbinlog utility and passes them to
# the server.
#
# However, when using row-based binary logging, updates are sent as row changes rather than SQL statements, and thus these statements
# are never written to the query log when binlog_format is ROW.
#
# A given update also might not be written to teh query log when this variable is set to MIXED, depending on the statement used.
#
# By default, the general query log is disabled. To specify the initial general query log state state explicitly, use --general_log[={0|1}].
# With no argument or an argument of 1, --general_log enables the log.
#
# With an argument of 0, this option disables the log.
#
# To specify a log file name, use --general_log_file=<file name>.
# To specify the log destination, use the log_output SYS_VAR.
#
# If you specify no name for the general query log file, the default name is <host_name>.log
# The server creates the file in the data dir unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different dir.
#
# To disable or enable the general query log or change the log file name at runtime, use the global general_log and
# general_log_file SYS_VAR.
#
# Set general_log to 0/OFF to disable the log or to 1/ON to enable.
#
# Set general_log_filter to specify name of the log file.
#
# If a log file is already opened, it's closed and a new one is opened.
#
# When the general query log is enabled, the server writes output to any destinations specified by the log_output SYS_VAR.
# If you enable the log, the server opens the log file and writes startup messages to it.
#
# However, further logging of queries to the file does not occur unless the FILE log designation is selected.
# If that destination is NONE, the server writes no queries even if it is enabled.
#
# Setting the log file name has no effect on logging if the log destination value does not contain FILE.
#
# Server restarts and log flushing do not cause a new general query log file to be generated (although flushing closes and reopens it).
# To rename the file and create a new one, use the following commands:
#
# 		mv <host_name>.log <host_name>-old.log
# 		mysqladmin flush-logs
# 		mv <host_name>-old.log <backup-dir>
#
# On Windows, use rename instead of mv.
#
# You can also rename the general query log file at runtime by disabling the log:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';
#
# With the log disabled, rename the log file externally -- for example, by cmd. THen enable it again:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
#
# This method works on any platform and does not require a server restart.
#
# To disable or enable general query logging for the current session, set the session sql_log_off variable to ON or OFF.
# (This assumes that the general query log itself is enabled)
#
# PWs in statements written to the general query log are rewritten by the server not to occur literally in plain text.
# Password rewriting can be suppressed for the general query log by starting the server with --log-raw option.
#
# THis option may be useful for diagnostics purposes, to see the exact text of statements as received by the
# server, but for security reasons - do not use this kind of mode in production mode.
#
# An implication of PW rewriting is that statements that cannot be parsed (due, for example, to syntax errors)
# are not written to the general query log because they cannot be known to be PW free.
#
# If you wish to log all, use --log-raw 
#
# PW rewriting occurs only when plain text PWs are expected.
# For statements with syntax that expect a PW hash value, no rewriting occurs.
#
# If plain text PW is supplied errorneously for such syntax, teh PW is logged as given - without rewriting.
#
# The log_timestamps SYS_VAR controls the time zone of timestamps in messages written to the general query log file
# (as well as to the slow query log file and the error log)
#
# It does not affect the time zone of general query log and slow query log messages written to log tables, but rows retrieved
# from those tables can be converted from the local system time zone ot any desired time zone with CONVERT_TZ() or by setting the
# session time_zone SYS_VAR.
#
# 
# The following pertains to THE BINARY LOG
#
# The binary log contains "events" that describe DB changes such as table creation operations or changes to table data.
# 
# It also contains events for statements that potentionally could have made changes (for example, a DELETE which matched no rows),
# unless row-based logging is used.
#
# The binary log also contains information about how long each statement took that updated data.
# The binary log has two important purposes:
#
# 		) For replication, the binary log on a master replication server provides a record of the data changes to be sent to slave servers.
#
# 		  The master server sends the events contained in its binary log to its slaves, which execute those events to make the same
# 		  data changes that were made on the master.
#
# 		) Certain data recovery operations require use of the binary log.
#
# 			After a backup has been restored, the events in the binary log that were recorded after the backup was
# 			made are re-executed.
#
# 			These events bring databases up to date from the point of the backup.
#
# The binary log is not used for statements such as SELECT or SHOW that do not modify data.
#
# To log all statements (for example, to identify a problem query), use the general query log
#
# Running a server with binary logging enabled makes performance slightly slower. 
#
# However, the benefits of the binary log in enabling you to set up replication and 
# for restore operations generally outweigh this minor performance decrement.
#
# The binary log is resillient to unexpected halts. Only complete events or transactions are logged or read back.
#
# PWs in statements written to the binary log are rewritten by the server not to occur literally in plain text.
#
# The following section pertains to server options and variables that affect the operation of binary logging.
#
# Binary logging is enabled by default (the log_bin SYS_VAR is set to ON). 
#
# The exception is if you use mysqld to initialize the data dir manually by invoking it with 
# the --initialize or --initialize-insecure option, when binary logging is disabled by default, but can be enabled by specifying the --log-bin option.
#
# To disable binary logging, you can specify the --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin option at startup.
# If either of these options is specified and --log-bin is also specified, the option specified later takes precedence.
#
# The --log-slave-updates and --slave-preserve-commit-order options require binary logging.
#
# If you disable binary logging, either omit these options, or specify --skip-log-slave-updates and
# --skip-slave-preserve-commit-order.
#
# MySQL disables these options by default when --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin is specified.
#
# If you specify --log-slave-updates or --slave-preserve-commit-order together with --skip-log-bin or
# --disable-log-bin, a warning error message is issued.
#
# The --log-bin[=<base name>] option is used to specify the base name for binary log files.
# If you do not supply the --log-bin option, MySQL uses binlog as the default base name for the binary log files.
#
# For compability with earlier releases, if you supply the --log-bin option with no string or with an empty string,
# the base name defaults to <host_name>-bin, using the name of the host machine.
#
# It is recommended that you specify a base name, so that if the host name changes, you can easily continue to use
# the same binary log file names. 
#
# If you supply an extension in the log name (for example, --log-bin=<base_name.extension>), the extension is silently removed and ignored.
# 
# mysqld appends a numeric extension to the binary log base name to generate binary log file names. The number increases each time the server
# creates a new log file, thus creating an ordered series of files.
#
# The server creates a new file in the series each time it starts or flushes the logs.
# The server also creates a new binary log file automatically after the current log's size reaches max_binlog_size.
#
# A binary log file may become larger than max_binlog_size if you are using large transaction because a transaction
# is written ot hte file in one piece, never split between files.
#
# To keep track of which binary log files have been used, mysqld also creates a binary log index file that contains the names
# of all used binary log files. 
#
# By default, this has the same base name as the binary log file, with the extension '.index'.
#
# You can change the name of the binary log index file with the --log-bin-index[=<file name>] option.
# You should not manually edit this file while mysqld is running: doing so would confuse mysqld.
#
# The term "binary log file" denotes a individual numbered file containing DB events. The term "binary log" collectively
# denotes the set of numbered binary log files plus the index file.
#
# The default location for binary log files and the binary log index file is the data directory.
#
# You can use the --log-bin option to specify an alternative location, by adding a leading absolute path name to the base name
# to specify a different dir.
#
# When the server reads an entry from the binary log index file, which tracks the binary log files that have been used,
# it checks whether the entry contains a relative path.
#
# If it does, the relative part of the path is replaced with the absolute path set using the --log-bin option.
#
# An absolute path recorded in the binary log index file remains unchanged; in such a case, the index file must be edited
# manually to enable a new path or paths to be used. 
#
# The binary log file base name and any specified path are available as the log_bin_basename SYS_VAR.
#
# In MySQL 5.7, a server ID had to be specified when binary logging was enabled, or the server would not start.
#
# In MySQL 8.0, the server_id SYS_VAR is set to 1 by default.
#
# The server can be started with this default ID when binary logging is enabled, but an informational message is issued
# if you do not specify a server ID explicitly using the --server-id option.
#
# For servers that are used in a replication topology, you must specify a unique nonzero server ID for each server.
#
# A client that has privs sufficient to set restricted session SYS_VARs can disable binary logging of its own statements
# by using a SET_sql_log_bin=OFF statement.
#
# By default, the server logs the length of the event as well as the event itself and uses this to verify that the event
# was written correctly.
#
# You can also cause the server to write checksums for the events by setting the binlog_checksum SYS_VAR.
#
# When reading back from the binary log, the master uses the event length by default, but can be made to use checksums
# if available by enabling the master_verify_checksum SYS_VAR.
#
# The slave I/O thread also verifies events received from the master. 
# You can cause the slave SQL thread to use checksums if available when reading from the relay log by enabling the slave_sql_verify_checksum SYS_VAR.
#
# The format of the events recorded in the binary log is dependent on the binary logging format. 
# Three format types are supported: row-based logging, statement-based logging and mixed-based logging.
#
# The binary logging format used depends on the MySQL version.
#
# The server evaluates the --binlog-do-db and --binlog-ignore-db options in the same way as it does the
# --replicate-do-db and --replicate-ignore-db options.
#
# A replication slave server is started with the --log-slave-updates setting enabled by default, meaning that the
# slave writes to its own binary log any data modifications that are received from the replication master.
#
# The binary log must be enabled for this setting to work.
# This setting enables the slave to act as a master to other slaves in chained replication.
#
# You can delete all binary log files with the RESET_MASTER statement or a subset of them with PURGE_BINARY_LOGS.
#
# If you are using replication, you should not delete old binary log files on the master until you are sure that no slave
# still needs to use them.
#
# For example, if your slaves never run more than three days behind, once a day you can execute mysqladmin flush-logs on the master
# and then remove any logs that are more than three days old.
#
# You can remove the files manually, but it is preferable to use PURGE_BINARY_LOGS, which also safely updates the binary log index
# file for you (and which can take a date argument)
#
# You can display the contents of binary log files with the mysqlbinlog utility.
# This can be useful when you want to reprocess statements in the log for a recovery operation.
#
# For example, you can update MySQL server from the binary log as follows:
#
# 	mysqlbinlog <log_file> | mysql -h <server_name>
#
# mysqlbinlog also can be used to display replication slave relay log file contents because they are written using the same
# format as binary log files.
#
# Binary logging is done immediately after a statement or transaction completes but before any locks are released or any commit is done.
# This ensures that the log is logged in commit order.
#
# Updates to nontransactional tables are stored in the binary log immediately after execution.
#
# Within an uncommitted transaction, all updates (UPDATE, DELETE or INSERT) that change transactional tables such as InnoDB tables
# are cached until a COMMIT statement is received by the server. 
#
# At that point, mysqld writes the entire transaction to the binary log before the COMMIT is executed.
#
# Modifications to nontransactional tables cannot be rolled back. If a transaction that is rolled back
# includes modifications to nontransactional tables, the entire transaction is logged with a ROLLBACK
# statement at the end to ensure that the modifications to those tables are replicated.
#
# When a thread that handles the transaction starts, it allocates a buffer of binlog_cache_size to buffer
# statements.
#
# If a statement is bigger than this, the thread opens a temporary file to store the transaction.
# The temporary file is deleted when the thread ends.
#
# The Binlog_cache_use status variable shows the number of transactions that used this buffer (and possibly a temporary file) for storing statements.
# The Binlog_cache_disk_use status variable shows how many of those transactions actually had to use a temporary file.
#
# These two variables can be used for tuning binlog_cache_size to a large enough value that avoids the use of temporary files.
#
# The max_binlog_cache_size SYS_VAR (default 4GB, which is also the maximum), can be used to restrict the total size used
# to cache a multiple-statement transaction.
#
# If a transaction is larger than this many bytes, it fails and rolls back. The min value is 4096.
#
# If you are using the binary log and row based logging, concurrent inserts are converted to normal inserts for CREATE ... SELECT or
# INSERT ... SELECT statements.
#
# This is done to ensure that you can re-create an exact copy of your tables by applying the log during a backup operation.
#
# If you are using statement-based logging, the original statement is written to the log.
#
# The binary log format has some known limitations that can affect recovery from backups. Later covered.
#
# Binary logging for stored programs is done and described later.
#
# Note htat hte binary log format differs in MySQL 8.0 from previous versions of MySQL, due to enhancements in replication.
#
# Writes to the binary log file and binary log index file are handled in the same way as writes to MyISAM tables.
#
# By default, the binary log is synched to disk at each write (sync_binlog=1). 
#
# If sync_binlog was not enabled, and the OS or machine (not only the MySQL server) crashed, there is a chance that the last
# statements of the binary log could be lost.
#
# To prevent this, enable the sync_binlog SYS_VAR to synch the binary log to disk after every N commit groups.
#
# The safest value for sync_binlog is 1 (the default), but this is also the slowest.
#
# In earlier MySQL releases, there was a chance of inconsistency between the table content and binary log content if a crash occured,
# even with sync_binlog set to 1.
#
# For example, if you are using InnoDB tables and the MySQL server processes a COMMIT statement, it writes many prepared transactions
# to the binary log in sequence, synchs the binary log, and then commits the transaction into InnoDB.
#
# If the server crashed between those two operations, the transaction would be rolled back by InnoDB at restart but still exist in the binary log.
#
# Such an issue was resolved in previous releases by enabling InnnoDB support for two-phase commit in XA transactions.
#
# In >= 5.8, the InnoDB support for two-phase commit in XA transactions is always enabled.
#
# InnoDB support for two-phase commit in XA transactions ensures that the binary log and InnoDB data files are synched.
# However, the MySQL server should also be configured to synch the binary log and the InnoDB logs to disk before committing the transactions.
#
# THe InnoDB logs are synched by default, and sync_binlog=1 ensures that the binary log is synchronized.
#
# The effect of implicit InnoDB support for two-phase commit in XA transactions and sync_binlog=1 is that at restart
# after a crash, after doing a rollback of transactions, the MySQL server scans the latest binary log file to collect
# transactions <xid> values and calculate the last valid position in the binary log file.
#
# The MySQL server then tells InnoDB to complete any prepared transactions that were successfully written to the binary log,
# and truncates the binary log to the last valid position.
#
# This ensures that the binary log reflects the exact data of InnoDB tables, and therefore the slave remains in synch
# with the master because it does not receive a statement which has been rolled back.
#
# If the MySQL Server discovers at crash recovery that the binary log is shorter than it should have been, it lacks at least
# one successfully committed InnoDB transaction.
#
# This should not happen if sync_binlog=1 and the disk/file system do an actual sync when they requested to (some do not), so the
# server prints an error message:
#
# 		The binary log <file_name> is shorter than its expected size.
#
# In this case, this binary log is not correct and replication should be restarted from a fresh snapshot of the master's data.
#
# The session values of the following SYS_VAR's are written to the binary log and honored by the replication slave when parsing the binary log:
#
# 		sql_mode (except that the NO_DIR_IN_CREATE mode is not replicated)
#
# 		foreign_key_checks
#
# 		unique_checks
#
# 		character_set_client
#
# 		collation_connection
#
# 		collation_database
#
# 		collation_server
#
# 		sql_auto_is_null
#
# The following pertains to Binary Logging Formats
#
# The server uses several logging formats to record information in the binary log:
#
# 		) Replication capabilities in MySQL originally were based on propagation of SQL statements from master to slave.
# 		  This is called statement-based logging.
#
# 		  You can cause this format to be used by starting the server with --binlog-format=STATEMENT
#
# 		) In <row-based loggin> (the default), the master writes events to the binary log that indicate how individual table rows
# 		  are affected.
#
# 		  You can cause the server to use row-based logging by starting it with --binlog-format=ROW
#
# 		) A third option is also available: mixed logging.
#
# 		  With mixed logging, the statement-based logging is used by default, but the logging mode switches automatically to
# 		  row-based in certain cases as described below.
#
# 		  You can cause MySQL to use mixed logging explicitly by starting mysqld with the option --binlog-format=MIXED
#
# The logging format can also be set or limited by the storage engine being used.
#
# This helps to eliminate issues when replicating certain statements between a master and slave which are using different storage engines.
#
# With statement-based replication, there may be issues with replicating nondeterministic statements.
#
# In deciding whether or not a given statement is safe for statement-based replication, MySQL determines whether it can guarantee
# that the statement can be replicated using statement-based logging.
#
# If MySQL cannot make this guarantee, it marks the statement as potentionally unreliable and issues the warning, Statement may not be safe to log in statement format.
#
# You can avoid these issues by using MySQL's row-based replication instead.
#
# The following pertains to Setting The Binary Log Format
#
# You can select the binary logging format explicitly by starting the MySQL server with --binlog-format=<type>.
# The supported values for <type> are:
#
# 		STATEMENT causes logging to be statement based.
#
# 		ROW causes logging to be row based. This is the default.
#
# 		MIXED causes logging to use mixed format.
#
# The logging format also can be switched at runtime, although note that there are a number of situations in which
# you cannot do this, as discussed later in this section.
#
# Set the global value of the binlog_format SYS_VAR to specify the format for clients that connect subsequent to the change:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL binlog_format = 'STATEMENT';
# 		SET GLOBAL binlog_format = 'ROW';
# 		SET GLOBAL binlog_format = 'MIXED';
#
# An individual client can control the logging format for its own statements by setting the session value of binlog_format:
#
# 		SET SESSION binlog_format = 'STATEMENT';
# 		SET SESSION binlog_format = 'ROW';
# 		SET SESSION binlog_format = 'MIXED';
#
# Changing the global binlog_format value requires privs sufficient to set Global SYS_VARs.
#
# Changing the session binlog_format value requires privs sufficient to set restricted SYS_VARs. 
#
# There are several reasons why a client might want to set binary logging on a per-session basis:
#
# 		) A session that makes many small changes to the DB might want to use row-based logging.
#
# 		) A session that performs updates that match many rows in the WHERE clause might want to use statement-based logging
# 		  because it will be more efficient to log a few statements than many rows.
#
# 		) Some statements require a lot of execution time on the master, but result in just a few rows being modified.
#
# 		  It might therefore be beneficial to replicate them using row-based logging.
#
# There are exceptions when you cannot switch the replication format at runtime:
#
# 		) The replication format cannot be changed from within a stored function or a trigger.
#
# 		) If the NDB storage engine is enabled.
#
# 		) If a session has open temporary tables, the replication format cannot be changed for the session (SET @@SESSION.binlog_format)
#
# 		) If any replication channel has open temporary tables, the replication format cannot be changed globally (SET @@GLOBAL.binlog_format or 
# 		  SET @@PERSIST.binlog_format)
#
# 		) If any replication channel applier thread is currently running, the replication format cannot be changed globally
# 		  (SET @@GLOBAL.binlog_format or SET @@PERSIST.binlog_format)
#
# Trying to switch the replication format in any of these cases (or attempting to set the current replication format) results in an error.
#
# You can, however - use PERSIST_ONLY (SET @@PERSIST_ONLY.binlog_format) to change the replication format at any time, because this action
# does not modify the runtime global SYS_VAR and takes effect only after a server restart.
#
# Switching the replication format at runtime is not recommended when any temporary table exist, because temporary tables are logged only
# when using statement-based replication, whereas with row-based replication and mixed replication, they are not logged.
#
# Switching the replication format while replication is ongoing can also cause issues.
#
# Each MySQL Server can set its own and only its own binary logging format (true whether binlog_format is set with global or session scope).
#
# This means that changing the logging format on a replication master does not cause a slave to change its logging format to match.
#
# When using STATEMENT mode, the binlog_format SYS_VAR is not replicated.
#
# When using MIXED or ROW logging mode, it is replicated but is ignored by the slave.
#
# A replication slave is not able to convert binary log entries received in ROW Logging format to STATEMENT format for use in its own binary log.
# 
# The slave must therefore use ROW or MIXED format if the master does. 
#
# Changing the binary logging format on the master from STATEMENT to ROW or MIXED while replication is ongoing to a slave with
# STATEMENT format can cause replication to fail with errors such as Error executing row event:
#
# 	 'Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary log since statement is in row format and BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT.'
#
# Changing the binary logging format on the slave to STATEMENT format when the master is still using MIXED or ROW format also
# causes the same type of replication failure.
#
# To change the format safely, you must stop replication and ensure that the same change is made on both the master and the slave.
#
# If you are using InnoDB tables and the transaction isolation level is READ_COMMITTED or READ_UNCOMMITTED, only row-based logging
# can be used.
#
# It is possible to change the logging format to STATEMENT, but doing so at runtime leads very rapidly to errors because InnoDB can no longer perform inserts.
#
# With the binary log format set to ROW, many changes are written to the binary log using the row-based format.
# Some changes, however, still use the statement-based format.
#
# Examples include all DDL (data definition language) statements such as CREATE_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE or DROP_TABLE.
#
# The --binlog-row-event-max-size option is available for servers that are capable of row-based replication.
# Rows are stored into the binary log in chunks having a size in bytes not exceeding the value of this option.
#
# The value must be a x of 256. Default is 8192.
#
# WARNING:
#
# 		When using <statement-based logging> for replication, it is possible for the data on the master and slave to become different if a statement
# 		is designed in such a way that the data modification is nondeterministic.
#
# 		That is, it is left to the will of the query optimizer.
#
# 		In general, this should not be done - even outside of replication.
#
# The following pertains to Mixed Binary Logging Format.
#
# When running in MIXED logging format, the server automatically switches from statement-based to row-based logging under the following conditions:
#
# 		) When a function contains UUID()
#
# 		) When one or more tables with AUTO_INCREMENT columns are updated and a trigger or stored function is invoked.
# 		  Like all other unsafe statements, this generates a warning if binlog_format = <STATEMENT>
#
# 		) When the body of a view requires row-based replication, the statement creating the view also uses it.
#
# 		  For example, this occurs when the statement creating a view uses the UUID() function.
#
# 		) When a call to a UDF is involved.
#
# 		) When FOUND_ROWS() or ROW_COUNT() is used (Bug #12092, Bug #30244)
#
# 		) When USER(), CURRENT_USER(), or CURRENT_USER is used. (Bug #28086)
#
# 		) When one of the tables involved is a log table in the mysql database.
#
# 		) When the LOAD_FILE() function is used. (Bug #39701)
#
# 		) When a statement refers to one or more SYS_VARs (Bug #31168)
#
# 			Exception: The following SYS_VAR, when used with session scope (only), do not cause the logging format to switch:
#
# 				) auto_increment_increment
#
# 				) auto_increment_offset
#
# 				) character_set_client
#
# 				) character_set_connection
#
# 				) character_set_database
#
# 				) character_set_server
#
# 				) collation_connection
#
# 				) collation_database
#
# 				) collation_server
#
# 				) foreign_key_checks
#
# 				) identity
#
# 				) last_insert_id
#
# 				) lc_time_names
#
# 				) pseudo_thread_id
#
# 				) sql_auto_is_null
#
# 				) time_zone
#
# 				) timestamp
#
# 				) unique_checks
#
# 
# In earlier releases, when mixed binary logging format was in use, if a statement was logged by row and the session that executed the
# statement had any temporary tables, all subsequent statements were treated as unsafe and logged in row-based format until all 
# temporary tables in use by that session were dropped.
#
# As of MySQL 8.0, operations on temporary tables are not logged in mixed binary logging format, and the presence of temporary tables
# in the session has no impact on the logging mode used for each statement.
#
# 		NOTE:
#
# 			A warning is generated if you try to execute a statement using statement-based logging that should be written using row-based logging.
# 			The warning is shown both in the client (in the output of SHOW_WARNINGS) and through the mysqld error log.
#
# 			A warning is added to the SHOW_WARNINGS table each time such a statement is executed.
# 			However, only the first statement that generated the warning for each client session is written to the error log to prevent flooding the log.
#
# In addition to the decisions above, individual engines can also determine the logging format used when information in a table is updated.
# The logging capabilities of an individual engine can be defined as follows:
#
# 		) If an engine supports row-based logging, the engine is said to be row-logging capable.
#
# 		) If an engine supports statement-based logging, the engine is said to be statement-logging capable.
#
# A given storage engine can support either or both logging formats.
#
# The following table lists the formats supported by each engine.
#
# 	Storage Engine 	Row Logging Supported 				Statement Logging Supported
# 	ARCHIVE  			Yes 										Yes
# 	BLACKHOLE 			Yes 										Yes
#  CSV 					Yes 										Yes
# 	EXAMPLE 				Yes 										No
# 	FEDERATED 			Yes 										Yes
# 	HEAP 					Yes 										Yes

# 	MyISAM 				Yes 										Yes
# 	MERGE 				Yes 										Yes
# 	NDB 					Yes 										No
#
# Whether a statement is to be logged and the logging mode to be used is determined according to:
#
# 		) the type of statement (safe, unsafe, or binary injected)
#
# 		) the binary logging format (STATEMENT, ROW or MIXED)
# 
# 		) the logging capabilities of the storage engine (statement capable, row capable, both or neither)
#
# 		(Binary injection refers to logging a change that must be logged using ROW format)
#
# Statements may be logged with or without a warning; failed statements are not logged, but generate errors in the log.
# This is shown in the following decision table:
#
# 		Type, binlog_format, SLC and RLC columns outline the conditions
#
# 		Error/Warning and Logged as columns represent the corresponding actions.

# When a warning is produced by determination, a standard MySQL warning is produced (and is available using SHOW_WARNINGS).
# The information is also written to the mysqld error log.
#
# Only one error for each error instance per client connection is logged to prevent flooding the log.
# The log message includes the SQL statement that was attempted.
#
# If a slave server has log_error_verbosity set to display warnings, the slave prints messages to the error log to provide
# information about its status, such as the binary log and relay log co-ords where it starts its job, when it is switching
# to another relay log - when it reconnects after a disconnect, statements that are unsafe for statement-based logging, etc.
#
# The following pertains to Logging Format for Changes to mysql Database Tables
#
# The contents of the grant tables in the mysql database can be modified directly (for example, with INSERT or DELETE) or 
# indirectly (for example, with GRANT or CREATE USER).
#
# Statements that affect mysql database tables are written to the binary log using the following rules:
#
# 		) Data manipulation statements that change data in mysql database tables directly are logged according ot the setting of
# 		  the binlog_format SYS_VAR.
#
# 	     This pertains to statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REPLACE, DO, LOAD_DATA_INFILE, SELECT, and TRUNCATE_TABLE.
#
# 		) Statements that change the mysql db indirectly are logged as statements regardless of the value of binlog_format.
#
# 		  This pertains to statements such as GRANT, REVOKE, SET_PASSWORD, RENAME_USER, CREATE (all forms except CREATE_TABLE_..._SELECT),
# 		  ALTER(all forms) and DROP(all forms)
#
# CREATE_TABLE_..._SELECT is a combination of data definition and data manipulation.
#
# The CREATE_TABLE part is logged using statement format and the SELECT part is logged according to the value of binlog_format.
#
# The following pertains to The Slow Query Log:
#
# The slow query log consists of SQL statements that take more than long_query_time seconds to execute and require at least
# min_examined_row_limit rows to be examined.
#
# The slow query log can be used to find queries that take a long time to execute and are therefore candidates for optimizations.
#
# However, examining a long slow query log can be a time-consuming task. You can use mysqldumpslow to process a slow query log file
# and summarize its contents.
#
# The time to acquire the initial locks is not counted as execution time. 
#
# mysqld writes a statement to the slow query log after it has been executed and after all locks have been released, so log order might differ from execution order.
#
# The following pertains to Slow Query Log Parameters
#
# The minimum and default values of long_query_time are 0 and 10, respectively.
# The value can be specified to a resolution of microseconds.
#
# By default, administrative statements are not logged, nor are queries that do not use indexes for lookups.
#
# This behavior can be changed using log_slow_admin_statements and log_queries_not_using_indexes, described later.
#
# By default, the slow query log is disabled.
# To specify the initial slow query log state explicitly, use --slow_query_log[={0|1}].
#
# WIth no argument or an arg of 1, --slow_query_log enables the log.
# With an arg of 0, this option disables the log.
#
# To specify a log file name, use --slow_query_log_file=<file_name>.
# To specify log destination, use the log_output SYS_VAR.
#
# 		NOTE: If you specify the TABLE log destination - a possible error is too many tables opening.
#
# If you specify no name for the slow query log file, the default name is <host_name>-slow.log
# The server creates the file in the data directory unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different one.
#
# To disable or enable the slow query log or change the log file name at runtime, use the global slow_query_log and slow_query_log_file SYS_VARs.
# Set slow_query_log to 0 to disable the log or to 1 to enable it.
#
# Set slow_query_log_file to specify the name of the log file.
# If a log file already is open, it is closed and the new file is opened.
#
# The server writes less info to the slow query log if you use the --log-short-format option.
#
# To include slow admin statements in the slow query log, enable the log_slow_admin_statements SYS_VAR.
# Admin statements include ALTER_TABLE, ANALYZE_TABLE, CHECK_TABLE, CREATE_INDEX, DROP_INDEX, OPTIMIZE_TABLE
# and REPAIR_TABLE.
#
# To include queries that do not use indexes for row lookups in the statements written to the slow query log,
# enable the log_queries_not_using_indexes SYS_VAR.
#
# Even with that var enabled, the server does not log queries that would not benefit from the presence of an index
# due to the table having fewer than two rows.
#
# When queries that do not use an index are logged, the slow query log may grow quickly.
#
# It is possible to put a rate limit on these queries by setting the log_throttle_queries_not_using_indexes SYS_VAR.
#
# By default, this var is 0 - which means there is no limit. Positive values imposes a per-minute limit on logging
# of queries that do not use indexes.
#
# The first such query opens a 60-second widnow within which the server logs queries up to the given limit, then suppresses
# additional queries.
#
# If there are suppressed queries when the window ends, the server logs a summary that indicates how many there were and the
# aggregate time spent in them.
#
# The next 60-second window begins when the server logs the next query that does not use indexes.
#
# The server uses the controlling parameter in the following order to determine whether to write a query to the slow query log:
#
# 		1) The query must either not be an administrative statement, or log_slow_admin_statements must be enabled.
#
# 		2) The query must have taken at least long_query_time seconds, or log_queries_not_using_indexes must be enabled and the query
# 			used no indexes for row lookups.
#
# 		3) THe query must have examined at least min_examined_row_limit rows.
#
# 		4) The query must not be suppressed according to the log_throttle_queries_not_using_indexes setting.
#
# The log_timestamps SYS_VAR controls the time zone of timestamps in messages written to the slow query log file 
# (as well as to the general query log file and the error log).
#
# It does not affect the time zone of general query log and slow query log messages written to log tables, but rows
# retrieved from those tables can be converted from the local system time zone to any desired time zone with CONVERT_TZ()
# or by setting the session time_zone SYS_VAR.
#
# By default, a replication slave does not write replicated queries to the slow query log.
# To change this, enable the log_slow_slave_statements SYS_VAR.
#
# The following pertains to Slow Query Log Contents
#
# When the slow query log is enabled, the server writes output to any destinations specified by the log_output SYS_VAR.
# If you enable the log, the server opens the log file and writes startup messages to it.
#
# However, further logging of queries to the file does not occur unless the FILE log destination is selected.
# If the destination is NONE, the server writes no queries even if the slow query log is enabled.
#
# Setting the log file name has no effect on logging if FILE is not selected as an output destination.
#
# If the slow query log is enabled and FILE is selected as an output destination, each statement written to the log
# is preceded by a line that begins with a # char and has these fields (with all fields or a single line):
#
# 		Query_time: <duration>
#
# 			The statement execution time in seconds
#
# 		Lock_time: <duration>
#
# 			The time to acquire locks in seconds.
#
# 		Rows_sent: <N>
#
# 			The number of rows sent to the client
#
# 		Rows_examined:
#
# 			The number of rows examined by the optimizer.
#
# Enabling the log_slow_extra SYS_VAR (available as of MySQL 8.0.14) causes the server to write the following extra fields
# to FILE output in addition to those just listed (TABLE output is unaffected).
#
# Some field descriptions refer to Status variables names.
# In the slow query log, the counters are per-statement values, not cumulative per-session values.
#
# 		Thread_id: ID
#
# 			The statement thread identifier.
#
# 		Errno: <error_number>
#
# 			The statement error number, or 0 if no error occurred.
#
# 		Killed: <N>
#
# 			If the statement was terminated, the error number indicating why or 0 if the statement terminated normally.
#
# 		Bytes_received: <N>
#
# 			The Bytes_received value for the statement.
#
# 		Bytes_sent: <N>
#
# 			The Bytes_sent value for the statement.
#
# 		Read_first: <N>
#
# 			The Handler_read_first value for the statement
#
# 		Read_last: <N>
#
# 			The Handler_read_last value for the statement.
#
# 		Read_key: <N>
#

#
# A given slow query log file may contain a mix of lines with and without the extra fields added by enabling log_slow_extra.
# Log file analyzers can determine whether a line contains the additional fields by the field count.
#
# Each statement written to the slow query log file is preceded by a SET statement that includes a timestamp.
# As of MySQL 8.0.14 - the timestamp indicates when the slow statement began executing.
#
# < 8.0.14 MySQL the timestamp indicates when the slow statement was logged (which occurs after statement finishes executing)
#
# PWs in statements written to the slow query log are rewritten by the server not to occur literally in plain text.
#
# The following pertains to The DDL Log:
#
# The DDL log, or metadata log, records metadata operations generated by data definition statements such as DROP_TABLE and ALTER_TABLE.
#
# MySQL uses this log to recover from crashes occurring in the middle of a metadata operation.
#
# When executing the statement DROP TABLE t1, t2 - we need to ensure that both t1 and t2 are dropped, and that each table
# drop is complete.
#
# ANother example of this type of SQL statement is ALTER_TABLE_t3_DROP_PARTITION_p2, where we must make certain that the partition
# is completely dropped and that its definition is removed from the list of partitions for table t3.
#
# A record of metadata operations such as those just described are written to the file ddl_log.log in the MySQL Data dir.
# This is a binary file, it is not intended to be human-readable, and do not modify it.
#
# ddl_log.log is not created until it is actually needed for recording metadata statements, and is removed following a successful start of
# mysqld.
#
# Thus, it is possible for this file not ot be present on a MySQL server that is functioning in a completely normal manner.
#
# Currently, ddl_log.log can hold up to 1048573 entries, or 4 GB. once this limit is exceeded, you must rename or remove the file before
# it is possible to execute any additional DDL statements. This is a known issue being worked on.
#
# There are no user-config server options or variables related to this file.
#
# The following pertains to Server Log Maintenance:
#
# MySQL Servers can create several different log files to help you see what activity is taking place.
# However, one must regularly clean up the logs.
#
# When using MySQL with logging enabled, you may want to back up and remove old log files from time to time and tell MySQL to start
# logging to new files.
#
# On a Linux (Red Hat) installation, you can use the mysql-log-rotate scripts for this.
#
# If you installed MySQL from an RPM distrib, this script should have been installed automatically.
#
# Be careful with said script if you are using binary log for replication. You should not remove binary logs until you are certain that
# their contents have been processed by all slaves.
#
# On other systems, you must install a short script yourself that you start from cron (or its equivalent) for hanling log files.
#
# Binary logs are automatically removed after the server's binary log expiration period.
# Removal of the files can take place at startup and when the binary log is flushed.
#
# The default binary log expiration period is 30 days. You can specify an alternative expiration period using the binlog_expire_logs_seconds
# SYS_VAR.
#
# If you are using replication, you should specify an expiration period that is no lower than the maximum amount of time your slaves might lag
# behind the master.
#
# To remove binary logs on demand, use the PURGE_BINARY_LOGS statement.
#
# You can force MySQL to start using new log files by flushing the logs.
#
# Log flushing occurs when you issue a FLUSH_LOGS statement or execute a mysqladmin flush-logs,
# mysqladmin refresh, mysqldump --flush-logs or mysqldump --master-data cmd.
#
# In addition, the binary log is flushed when its size reaches the value of the max_binlog_size SYS_VAR.
#
# FLUSH_LOGS supports optional modifiers to enable selective flushing of individual logs (for example, FLUSH_BINARY_LOGS)
#
# A log-flushing operation does the following:
#
# 		) If general query logging or slow query logging to a log file is enabled, the server closes and reopens the general query log file or slow query log file.
#
# 		) If binary logging is enabled, the server closes the current binary log file and opens a new log file with the next sequence number.
#
# 		) If the server was started with the --log-error option to cause the error log to be written to a file, the server closes and reopens the log file.
#
# The server creates a new binary log file when you flush the logs.
# However, it just closes and reopens the general and slow query log files.
#
# To cause new files to be created on Unix, rename the current log files before flushing them.
# At flush time, the server opens new log files with the original names.
#
# For example, if the general and slow query log files are named mysql.log and mysql-slow.log, you can use
# a series of commands akin to:
#
# 	cd <mysql-data-directory>
# 	mv mysql.log mysql.old
# 	mv mysql-slow.log mysql-slow.old
# 	mysqladmin flush-logs
#
# On Windows, it's rename rather than mv.
#
# At this point, you can make a backup of mysql.old and mysql-slow.old and remove them from the disk.
#
# A similar strategy can be used to back up the error log file, if there is one.
#
# You can rename the general query log or slow query log at runtime by disabling the log:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';
# 		SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'OFF';
#
# With the logs disabled, rename the log files externally; for example, from the cmd line.
# Then enable the logs again:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
# 		SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
#
# This method works on any platform and does not require a server restart.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		For the server to recreate a given log file after you have renamed the file externally, the file location
# 		must be writable by the server.
#
# 		This may not always be the case. For example, on Linux, the server might write the error log as /var/log/mysqld.log,
# 		where /var/log is owned by root and not writable by mysqld.
#
# 		In this case, the log-flushing operation will fail to create a new log file.
#
# 		To handle this situation, you must manually create the new log file with the proper ownership after renaming
# 		the original log file.
#
# 		For example, execute these commands as root:
#
# 			mv /var/log/mysqld log /var/log/mysqld.log.old
# 			install -omysql -gmysql -m0644 /dev/null /var/log/mysqld.log
#
# The following pertains to MySQL Server Components
#
# MySQL Server includes a component-based infrastructure for extending server capabilities.
# A component provides services that are available to the server and other components.
#
# (With respect to service use, the server is a component, equal to other components)
# Components interact with each other only through the services they provide.
#
# MySQL distributions include several components that implement server extensions:
#
# 		) Components for configuring error logging.
#
# 		) A component for checking PWs.
#
# SYS_VARs and STATUS_VARs implemented by a server component are exposed when the component is installed and have names that
# begin with a component-specific prefix.
#
# For example, the log_filter_dragnet error log filter component implements a SYS_VAR named log_error_filter_rules,
# the full name of which is dragnet.log_error_filter_rules.
#
# To refer to this var, use the full name.
#
# The following section describes how to install and uninstall components, and how to determine at runtime which components
# are installed and obtain information about them.
#
# For information about the internal implementation of components, it's covered later.
# For example, if you intend to write your own components, this information is important for understanding how components work.
#
# The following pertains to Installing and Uninstalling Components
#
# Server components must be loaded into the server before they can be used.
# MySQL supports component loading at runtime.
#
# The INSTALL_COMPONENT and UNINSTALL_COMPONENT SQL statements enable component loading and unloading.
# For example:
#
# 		INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
# 		UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
#
# A loader service handles component loading and unloading, and also lists loaded components in the <component> table of the
# <mysql> SYS_DB that serves as a registry.
#
# The SQL statements for component manipulation affect server operation and the mysql.component SYS_TABLE as follows:
#
# 		) INSTALL_COMPONENT loads components into the server.
# 		The components become active immediately.
#
# 		The loader service also registers loaded components in the mysql.component SYS_TABLE.
#
# 		For subsequent server restarts, the loader service loads any components listed in mysql.component during
# 		the startup sequence.
#
# 		This occurs even if the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option.
#
# 		) UNINSTALL_COMPONENT deactivates components and unloads them from the server.
#
# 		The loader service also unregisters the components from the mysql.component SYS_TABLE
# 		so that they are no longer loaded during the startup sequence for subsequent server restarts.
#
# Compared to the corresponding INSTALL_PLUGIN statement for server plugins, the INSTALL_COMPONENT statement for components
# offers the significant advantage that it is not nessecary to know any platform-specific file name suffix for naming the component.
#
# This means that a given INSTALL_COMPONENT statement can be executed uniformly across platforms.
#
# The following pertains to Obtaining Server Component Information:
#
# The component table in the mysql system database contains information about currently loaded components and shows which
# components have been registered with INSTALL_COMPONENT.
#
# To see which components are installed, use:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM mysql.component;
#
# The following pertains to Error Log Components:
#
# This section describes the characteristics of individual error log components.
# 
# A log component can be a filter or a sink:
#
# 		) A filter processing log events, to add, remove or modify event fields, or to delete events entirely.
# 		  The resulting events pass to the next log component named in the log_error_services SYS_VAR.
#
# 		) A sink is a destination (writer) for log events. Typically, a sink processes log events into log messages
# 		  that have a particular format and writes these messages to its associated output, such as a file or the system log.
#
# The server executes filters and sinks in the log_error_services value in the order they are named.
# The rightmost component should therefore be a sink.
#
# If the rightmost component is a filter, any changes it has on events have no effect on output.
#
# The following sections describe individual log components, grouped by component type:
#
# 		Error Log Filter Components
#
# 		Error Log Sink Components
#
# Component descriptions include these types of information:
#
# 		) The component name and intended purpose.
#
# 		) Whether the component is built in or must be loaded.
#
# 		  For a loadable component, the description specifies the URN to use to load and unload the component with
# 		  the INSTALL_COMPONENT and UNINSTALL_COMPONENT statements.
#
# 		) Whether the component can be listed multiple times in the log_error_services value.
#
# 		) For a sink component, the destination to which the component writes output.
#
# Error Log Filter Components
#
# 		Error log filter components implement filtering of error log events:
#
# 			) If no filter component is enabled, no filtering occurs.
#
# 			) Any enabled filter component affects log events only for components listed later in the log_error_services value.
# 			  In particular, for any log sink component listed in log_error_services earlier than any filter component, no log event filtering occurs.
#
# The log_filter_internal Component
#
# 		) Purpose: Implements filtering based on the log_error_verbosity SYS_VAR.
#
# 		) URN: This component is built in and need not be loaded with INSTALL_COMPONENT before use.
#
# 		) Multiple uses permitted: No.
#
# 		Because log_error_verbosity affects the log_filter_internal component, log_error_verbosity has no effect on logging if
# 		log_filter_internal is not enabled.
#
# The log_filter_dragnet Component
#
# 		) Purposes: Implements filtering based on the rules defined by the dragnet.log_error_filter_rules SYS_VAR.
# 		
# 		) URN: file://component_log_filter_dragnet
#
# 		) Multiple uses permitted: No.
#
# Error Log Sink Components
#
# Error log sink components are writers that implement error log output. If no sink component is enabled, no log output occurs.
#
# Some sink component descriptions refer to the default error log destination.
# This is the console or a file and is indicated by the fault of the log_error SYS_VAR.
#
# The log_sink_internal Component
#
# 		) Purpose: Implements traditional error log message output format.
#
# 		) URN: This component is built in and need not be loaded with INSTALL_COMPONENT before use.
#
# 		) Multiple uses permitted: No.
#
# 		) Output destination: Writes to the default error log destination.
#
# The log_sink_json Component
#
# 		) Purpose: Implements JSON-format error logging.
#
# 		) URN: file://component_log_sink_json
#
# 		) Multiple uses permitted: Yes.
#
# 		) Output destination: The JSON log writer determines its output destination based on the default error log destination,
# 									 which is given by the log_error SYS_VAR:
#
# 									 		) If log_error names a file, the JSON writer bases output file naming on that file name, plus a numbered .<NN> json suffix,
# 											  with NN starting at 00.
#
# 											  For example, if log_error is <file_name>, successive instances of log_sink_json named in the log_error_services
# 											  value write to <file_name>.00.json, <file_name>.01.json and so forth.
#
# 											) If log_error is stderr, the JSON writer writes to the console.
#
# 											  If log_json_writer is named multiple times in the log_error_services value, they all write
# 											  to the console, which is likely not useful.
#
# The log_sink_syseventlog Component:
#
# 		) Purpose: Implements error logging to the system log. This is the Event Log on Windows, and syslog on Unix and Unix-like systems.
#
# 		) URN: file://component_log_sink_syseventlog
#
# 		) Multiple uses permitted: No.
#
# 		) Output destination: Writes to the system log. Does not use the default error log destination.
#
# The log_sink_test Component:
#
# 		) Purposes: intended for internal use in writing test cases. Not intended for production use.
#
# 		) URN: file://component_log_sink_test
#
# 		) Multiple uses permitted: Yes.
#
# 		) Output destination: Writes to the default error log destination.
#
# The following pertains to MySQL Server Plugins:
#
# MySQL supports a plugin API that enables creation of server components.
#
# PLugins can be loaded at server startup, or loaded and unloaded at runtime without restarting the server.
#
# The components supported by this interface include, but are not limited to, storage engines, INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables,
# full-text parser plugins and server extensions.
#
# MySQL distributions include several plugins that implement server extensions:
#
# 		) Plugins for authenticating attempts by clients to connect to MySQL Server.
# 		  Plugins are available for several authentication protocols.
#
# 		) A connection-control plugin that enables administrators to introduce an increasing delay after a certain number of consecutive
# 		  failed client connection attempts.
#
# 		) A password-validation plugin implements password strength policies and assesses the strength of potentional PWs.
#
# 		) Semisynch replication plugins implement an interface to replication capabilities that permit the master to proceed
# 		  as long as at least one slave has responded to each transaction.
#
# 		) Group Replication enables you to create a highly available distributed MySQL service across a group of MySQL server instances,
# 		  with data consistency, conflict detection and resolution, and group membership services - are all built-in.
#
# 		) MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a thread pool plugin that manages connection threads to increase server performance by
# 		  effectively managing statement execution threads for large numbers of client connections.
#
# 		) MySQL Enterprise Edition includes an audit plugin for monitoring and logging of connection and query activity.
#
# 		) MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a firewall plugin that implements an application-level firewall to enable DB admin to permit
# 		  or deny SQL statement execution based on matching against whitelists of accepted statement patterns.
#
# 		) A query rewrite plugin examines statements received by MySQL Server and possibly rewrites them before the server executes them.
#
# 		) Version Tokens enable creation of and Synching around server tokens that applications can use to prevent accessing incorrect or
# 		  out-of-date data.
#
# 		  Version Tokens is based on a plugin lib that implements a version_tokens plugin and a set of user-defined functions.
#
# 		) Keyring plugins provide secure storage for sensitive info.
#
# 		) X Plugin extends MySQL server to be able to function as a document store.
#
# 		  Running X Plugin enables MySQL Server to communicate with clients using the X protocol, which is designed 
# 		  to expose the ACID compliant storage abilities of MySQL as a document store.
#
# 		) Test framework plugins test server services. 
#
# The following section pertains to installation and uninstallation of plugins, and how to determine at runtime which plugins
# are installed and obtain information about them.
#
# More info about writing them later.
#
# The following section pertains to Installing and Uninstalling Plugins:
#
# Server plugins must be loaded into the server before they can be used.
# MySQL supports plugin loading at server startup and runtime.
#
# It is also possible to control the activation state of loaded plugins at startup, and to unload them at runtime.
#
# While a plugin is loaded, information about it is available from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table and the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# INSTALLING PLUGINS:
#
# Before a server plugin can be used, it must be installed using one of the following methods.
#
# In the desc., <plugin_name> stands for a plugin name such as innodb, csv or validate_password.
#
# Built-in plugins:
#
# 		A built-in plugin is known by the server automatically. Normally, the server enables the plugin at startup.
# 		Some built-in plugins permits this to be changed with the --plugin_name[=<activation_state>] option.
#
# Plugins registered in the mysql.plugin system table:
#
# 		The plugin table in the mysql system database serves as a registry of plugins (other than built-in plugins, which need not be registered).
#
# 		At startup, the server loads each plugin listed in the table. Normally, for a plugin loaded from the mysql.plugin table,
# 		the server also enables the plugin.
#
# 		This can be changed with the --plugin_name[=<activation_state>] option.
#
# 		If the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option, it does not consult the mysql.plugin table and does not
# 		load the plugins listed there.
#
# Plugins named with command-line options:
#
# 		A plugin located in a plugin library file can be loaded at server startup with the --plugin-load, --plugin-load-add,
# 		or --early-plugin-load option.
#
# 		Normally, for a plugin loaded at startup, teh server also enables the plugin. This can be changed with the --<plugin_name>[=<activation_state>] option.
#
# 		The --plugin-load and --plugin-load-add options load plugins after built-in plugins and storage engines have initialized during the
# 		server startup sequence.
#
# 		The --early-plugin-load option is used to load plugins that must be available prior to initialization of built-in plugins and storage engines.
#
# 		The value of each plugin-loading option is a semicolon-separated list of <name>=<plugin_library> and <plugin_library> values.
#
# 		Each <name> is the name of a plugin to load, and <plugin_library> is the name of the library file that contains the plugin code.
# 		If a plugin library is named without any preceding plugin name, the server loads all plugins in the library.
#
# 		The server looks for plugin library files in the directory named by the plugin_dir SYS_VAR.
#
# 		Plugin-loading options do not register any plugin in the mysql.plugin table.
#
# 		For subsequent restarts, the server loads the plugin again only if --plugin-load, --plugin-load-add, or --early-plugin-load is given again.
# 		 		 		
# 		I.e, it produces a one-time plugin-installation operation that persists for a single server invocation.
#
# 		--plugin-load, --plugin-load-add, and --early-plugin-load enable plugins to be loaded even when --skip-grant-tables is given
# 		(which causes the server to ignore the mysql.plugin table)
#
# 		--plugin-load, --plugin-load-add and --early-plugin-load also enables plugins to be loaded at startup that cannot be loaded at runtime.
# 		
# 		The --plugin-load-add option complements the --plugin-load option:
#
# 			) Each instance of --plugin-load resets the set of plugins to load at startup, whereas --plugin-load-add adds a plugin or plugins to the set
# 			of plugins to be loaded without resetting the current set.
#
# 			Consequently, if multiple instances of --plugin-load are specified, onl the last one takes effect.
# 			With multiple instances of --plugin-load-add, all of them take effect.
#
# 			) The argument format is the same as for --plugin-load, but multiple instances of --plugin-load-add can be used to avoid specifying
# 			a large set of plugins as a single long unwieldy --plugin-load argument.
#
# 			) --plugin-load-add can be given in the absence of --plugin-load, but any instance of --plugin-load-add that appears before --plugin-load
# 			has no effect because --plugin-load resets the set of plugins to load.
#
# For example, these options:
#
# 		--plugin-load=x --plugin-load-add=y is equivalent to --plugin-load="x;y"
#
# But:
#
# 		--plugin-load-add=y --plugin-load=x is equal to --plugin-load=x (due to ordering)
#
# The following pertains to Plugins installed with the INSTALL_PLUGIN statement:
#
#		A plugin located in a plugin library file can be loaded at runtime with the INSTALL_PLUGIN statement.
#
# 		The statement also registers the plugin in the mysql.plugin table to cause the server to load it on 
# 		on subsequent restarts. For this reason, INSTALL_PLUGIN requires the INSERT privs for the mysql.plugin table.
#
# 		The plugin library file base name depends on your platform. Common suffixes are .so (Unix/Unix-based systems), .dll for Windows
#
# 		Example: The --plugin-load option installs a plugin at server startup. To install a plugin named myplugin from a plugin library file
# 					named somepluglib.so, use these lines in a my.cnf file:
#
# 					[mysqld]
# 					plugin-load=myplugin=somepluglib.so
#
# 		In this case, the plugin is not registered in mysql.plugin. Restarting the server without the --plugin-load option causes the plugin not to be loaded at startup.
#
# 		Alternatively, the INSTALL_PLUGIN statement causes the server to lodd the plugin code from the library file at runtime:
#
# 			INSTALL PLUGIN myplugin SONAME 'somepluglib.so';
#
# 		INSTALL_PLUGIN also causes "permanent" plugin registration: The plugin is listed in the mysql.plugin table to ensure that the
# 		server loads it on subsequent restarts.
#
# 		Many plugins can be loaded either at server startup or at runtime. However, if a plugin is designed such that it must be loaded
# 		and initialized during server startup, attempts to load it at runtime using INSTALL_PLUGIN produces an error:
#
# 			INSTALL PLUGIN myplugin SONAME 'somepluglib.so';
# 			ERROR 1721 (HY000): Plugin 'myplugin' is marked as not dynamically
# 			installable. You have to stop the server to install it.
#
# 		In this case, you must use --plugin-load, --plugin-load-add or --early-plugin-load.
#
# 		If a plugin is named both using a --plugin-load, --plugin-load-add or --early-plugin-load option
# 		(as a result of an earlier INSTALL_PLUGIN statement) in the mysql.plugin table, the server starts but
# 		writes these mesages to the error log:
#
# 			[ERROR] Function 'plugin_name' already exists
# 			[Warning] Couldn't load plugin named 'plugin_name' with soname 'plugin_object_file'
#
# Controlling Plugin Activation State:
#
# 		If the server knows about a plugin when it starts (for example, because the plugin is named using a --plugin-load option or is registered
# 		in the mysql.plugin table), the server loads and enables the plugin by default.
#
# 		It is possible to control activation state for such a plugin using a --<plugin_name>[=<activation_state>] startup option,
# 		where <plugin_name> is the name of the plugin to affect, such as innodb, csv or validate_password.
#
# 		As with other options, dashes and underscores are interchangable in option names.
# 		Also, activation state values are not case-sensitive.
#
# 		For example, --my_plugin=ON and --my-plugin=on are equivalent.
#
# 			--<plug_name>=OFF - Tells the server to disable the plugin. This may not be possible for certain built-in plugins, such as mysql_native_password.
#
# 			--<plugin_name>[=ON] - tells the server to enable the plugin. (Specifying the option as --<plugin_name> without a value has the same effect.)
# 										  If the plugin fails to initialize, the server runs with the plugin disabled.
#
# 			--<plugin_name>=FORCE - Tells the server to enable the plugin, but if plugin initialization fails, the server does not start.
# 											In other words, this option forces the server to run with the plugin enabled or not at all.
#
# 			--<plugin_name>=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT - Like FORCE, but in addition prevents the plugin from being unloaded at runtime.
# 																If a user attempts to do so with UNINSTALL_PLUGIN, an error occurs.
#
# 		PLugin activation states are visible in the LOAD_OPTION column of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table.
#
# 		Suppose that CSV, BLACKHOLE and ARCHIVE are built-in pluggable storage engines and that you want the server to load them at startup,
# 		subject to these conditions:
#
# 			) The server is permitted to run if CSV initialization fails 
# 			) must require that BLACKHOLE initialization succeeds 
# 			) should disable ARCHIVE.
# 			
# 			To accomplish that, use these lines in an option file:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				csv=ON
# 				blackhole=FORCE
# 				archive=OFF
#
# 			The --enable-<plugin_name> option format is a synonym for --<plugin_name>=ON.
# 			The --disable-<plugin_name> and --skip-<plugin_name> option formats are synonyms for --<plugin_name>=OFF
#
# 			If a plugin is disabled, either explicitly with OFF or implicitly because it was enabled with ON but failed to initialize,
# 			aspects of server operation that require the plugin will change.
#
# 			For example, if the plugin implements a storage engine, existing tables for the storage engine becomes inaccessible,
# 			and attempts to create new tables for the storage engine result in tables that use the default storage engine unless
# 			the NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION SQL mode is enabled to cause an error to occur instead.
#
# 			Disabling a plugin may require adjustment to other options.
#
# 			For example, if you start the server using --skip-innodb to disable InnoDB, other innodb_<xxx> options likely
# 			will need to be omitted at startup.
#
# 			In addition, because InnoDB is the default storage engine - it will not start unless you specify another available storage
# 			engine with --default_storage_engine.
#
# 			You must also set --default_tmp_storage_engine.
#
# UNINSTALLING PLUGINS
#
# 		At runtime, the UNINSTALL PLUGIN statement disables and uninstalls a plugin known to the server.
#
# 		The statement unloads the plugin and removes it from the mysql.plugin system table, if it is registered there.
# 		
# 		For this reason, UNINSTALL_PLUGIN statements require the DELETE privs for the mysql.plugin table.
# 		With the plugin no longer registered in the table, the server does not load the plugin automatically for subsequent restarts.
#
# 		UNINSTALL_PLUGIN can load a plugin regardless of whether it was loaded at runtime with INSTALL_PLUGIN or at startup with a 
# 		plugin-loading option, subject to these conditions:
#
# 			) It cannot unload plugins that are built in to the server. These can be identified as those that have a library name of NULL in the output
# 			  from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS or SHOW_PLUGINS.
#
# 			) It cannot unload plugins for which the server was started with --<plugin_name>=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT, which prevents plugin unloading at runtime.
# 			  These can be identified from the LOAD_OPTION column of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table.
#
# 		To uninstall a plugin that currently is loaded at server startup with a plugin-loading option, use this procedure:
#
# 			1. Remove any options related to the plugin from the my.cnf file.
#
# 			2. Restart the server.
#
# 			3. Plugins normally are installed using either a plugin-loading option at startup or with INSTALL_PLUGIN at runtime,
# 				but not both.
#
# 				However, removing options fora plugin from the my.cnf file may not be sufficient to uninstall it if at some point,
# 				INSTALL_PLUGIN has also been used.
#
# 				If the plugin still appears in the output from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS or SHOW_PLUGINS,
# 				use UNINSTALL_PLUGIN to remove it from the mysql.plugin table.
#
# 				Then restart the server again.
#
# The following pertains to Obtaining Server PLugin Information:
#
# There are several ways to determine which plugins are installed in the server:
#
# 		) The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table contains a row for each loaded plugin. 
#
# 		  Any that have a PLUGIN_LIBRARY value of NULL are built in and cannot be unloaded.

#
# The following section pertains to MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool
#
# NOTE: MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product.
#
# MySQL Enterprise Edition includes MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool, implemented using a server plugin.
# The default thread-handling model in MySQL Server executes statements using one thread per client connection.
#
# As more clients connect to the server and execute statements, overall performance decreases.
#
# The thread pool plugin provides an alternative thread-handling model designed to reduce overhead and improve performance.
#
# The plugin implements a thread pool that increases server performance by efficiently managing statement execution
# threads for large numbers of client connections.
#
# The thread pool addresses several problems of the model that uses one thread per connection:
#
# 		) Too many thread stacks make CPU caches almost useless in highly parallel execution workloads.
#
# 		  The thread pool promotes thread stack reuse to minimize the CPU cache footprint.
#
# 		) With too many threads executing in parallel, context switching overhead is high.
#
# 		  This also presents a challenging task to the OS system scheduler. 
#
# 		  The thread pool controls the number of active threads to keep the parallelism within the MySQL server at a level that it can handle
# 		  and that is appropiate for the server host on which MySQL is executing.
#
# 		) Too many transactions executing in parallel increases resource contention. In InnoDB, this increases the time
# 		  spent holding central mutexes.
#
# 		  The thread pool controls when transactions start to ensure that not too many execute in parallel.
#
# The following pertains to the Thread Pool Components:
#
# The thread pool features comprises these components:
#
# 		) A plugin library file implements a plugin for the thread pool code as well as several associated monitoring tables that provide info about thread pool ops:
#
# 			) As of MySQL 8.0.14, the monitoring tables are Performance Schema Tables
#
# 			)	< 8.0.14, the monitoring tables are INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.
#
# 			 	The INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables now are deprecated.
#
# 				To transition old tables to new tables, this is pertinent:
#
# 					 SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TP_THREAD_STATE;
#
# 				The application should use this query instead:
#
# 					SELECT * FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_state;
#
# 		NOTE: If you do not load all the monitoring tables, some or all MySQL Enterprise Monitor thread pool graphs will be empty.
#
# 		) Several SYS_VARs are related to the thread pool. The thread_handling SYS_VAR has a value of loaded-dynamically when the server
# 		  successfully loads the thread pool plugin.
#
# 		  The other related VARs are implemented by the thread pool plugin; they are not available unless it is enabled:
#
# 				) thread_pool_algorithm: The concurrency algorithm to use for scheduling
#
# 				) thread_pool_high_priority_connection: How to shcedule statement execution for a session
#
# 				) thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer: How long before the thread pool moves a statement awaiting execution from the low-prio queue to high-prio queue.
#
# 				) thread_pool_max_unused_threads: How many sleeping threads to permit.
#
# 				) thread_pool_size: The number of thread groups in the thread pool. This is the most improtant param controlling thread pool performance.
#
# 				) thread_pool_stall_limit: The time before an executing statement is considered to be stalled.
#
# 			If any variable implemented by the plugin is set to an illegal value at startup, plugin initialization fails and the plugin does not load.
#
# 		) The Performance Schema has instruments that expose information about the thread pool and may be used to investiage operational performance.
# 		  
# 		  SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments WHERE NAME LIKE '%thread_pool%';
#
# The following section pertains to Thread Pool Installation:
#
# 		This section describes how to install MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool.
# 
# 		To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by the plugin_dir SYS_VAR).
# 		If necessary - configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# 		The plugin library file base name is thread_pool. The file name suffix differs per platform (for example, .so on UNIX based systems, .dll for Windows)
#
# THREAD POOL INSTALLATION >= MySQL 8.0.14
#
# 		In MySQL 8.0.14 and higher, the thread pool monitoring tables are Performance Schema tables that are loaded and unloaded along with
# 		the thread pool plugin.
#
# 		The INFORMATION_SCHEMA versions of the tables are deprecated but still there. Those are installed per < 8.0.14
#
# 		To enable thread pool capability, load the plugin by starting the server with the --plugin-load-add option.
#
# 		To do this, put these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix for your platform if needed):
#
# 			[mysqld]
# 			plugin-load-add=thread_pool.so
#
# 		To verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
# 		For instance:
#
# 			SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'thread%';
# 			+---------------+---------------+
# 			| PLUGIN_NAME 	 | PLUGIN_STATUS |
# 			+---------------+---------------+
# 			| thread_pool 	 | ACTIVE 		  |
# 			+---------------+---------------+
#
# 		To verify that the Performance Schema monitoring tables are available, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES table or use
# 		the SHOW_TABLES statement.
#
# 		For example:
#
# 			SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'performance_schema' AND TABLE_NAME LIKE 'tp%';
# 			+-------------------------+
# 			| TABLE_NAME 				  |
# 			+-------------------------+
# 			| tp_thread_group_state   |
# 			| tp_thread_group_stats   |
# 			| tp_thread_state 		  |
# 			+-------------------------+
#
# If the server loads the thread pool plugin successfully, it sets the thread_handling SYS_VAR to loaded-dynamically.
#
# If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# THREAD POOL INSTALLATION PRIOR TO MySQL 8.0.14
#
# < 8.0.14, the thread pool monitoring tables are plugins separate from the thread pool plugin and can be installed separately.
#
# To enable thread pool capability, load the plugins to be used by starting the server with the --plugin-load-add option.
# To do this, put these lines in the server my.cnf (adjust the .so suffix for your platformas necessary):
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		plugin-load-add=thread_pool.so
#
# To verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'thread%';
# +---------------------------------------+
# | PLUGIN_NAME 		| PLUGIN_STATUS 		|
# +------------------+--------------------+
# | thread_pool 	 	| ACTIVE 				|
# +------------------+--------------------+
#
# To verify that the Performance Schema monitoring table are available, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES or use the 
# SHOW_TABLES statement.
#
# For example:
#
# SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'performance_schema' AND TABLE_NAME LIKE 'tp%';
#
# +------------------------------------------+
# | TABLE_NAME 										|
# +------------------------------------------+
# | tp_thread_group_state 							|
# | tp_thread_group_stats 							|
# | tp_thread_state 									|
# +------------------------------------------+
#
# If the server loads the thread pool plugin successfully, it sets the thread_handling SYS_VAR to loaded-dynamically.
#
# If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# THREAD POOL INSTALLATION PRIOR TO 8.0.14
#
# Before 8.0.14 - the thread pool monitoring tables are plugins separate from the thread pool plugin and can be installed
# separetely.
#
# To enable thread pool capability, load the plugins to be used by starting the server with the --plugin-load-add option.
#
# For example, if you name only hte plugin library file, the server loads all plugins that it contains (that is, the thread pool
# plugin and all the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables).
#
# To do this, put these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix for your platform as necessary):
#
# [mysqld]
# plugin-load-add=thread_pool.so
#
# That is equivalent to loading all thread pool plugins by manually naming them individually:
#
# [mysqld]
# plugin-load-add=thread_pool=thread_pool.so
# plugin-load-add=tp_thread_state=thread_pool.so
# plugin-load-add=tp_thread_group_state=thread_pool.so
# plugin-load-add=tp_thread_group_stast=thread_pool.so
#
# If desired, you can load individual plugins from the library file. To load the thread pool plugin but not the INFORMAITON_SCHEMA tables,
# use an option as this:
#
# [mysqld]
# plugin-load-add=thread_pool=thread_pool.so
#
# To load the thread pool plugin and only the TP_THREAD_STATE INFORMATION_SCHEMA table, use options like this:
#
# [mysqld]
# plugin-load-add=thread_pool=thread_pool.so
# plugin-load-add=tp_thread_state=thread_pool.so
#
# To verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'thread%' OR PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'tp%';
#
# +------------------------------------------------------------+
# | PLUGIN_NAME 							| 		PLUGIN_STATUS 			|
# +---------------------------------+--------------------------+
# | thread_pool 							| ACTIVE 						|
# | TP_THREAD_STATE 						| ACTIVE 						|
# | TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATE 				| ACTIVE 						|
# | TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATS 				| ACTIVE 						|
# +---------------------------------+--------------------------+
#
# If the server loads the thread pool plugin successfully, it sets the thread_handling SYS_VAR to loaded-dynamically.
#
# If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# The following pertains to THREAD POOL OPERATION:
#
# The thread pool consists of a number of thread groups, each of which manages a set of client connections.
# As connections are established, the thread pool assigns them to thread groups in round-robin fashion.
#
# The number of thread groups is configurable using the thread_pool_size SYS_VAR.
# The default number of groups is 16.
#
# The max number of threads per group is 4096 (or 4096 on systems where one thread is used interally)
#
# The thread pool separates connections and threads, so there is no fixed relationship between connections and the
# threads that execute statements received from those connections.
#
# This differs from the default thread-handling model that associates one thread with one connection such that the
# thread executes all statements from the connection.
#
# The thread pool tries to ensure a maximum of one thread executing in each group at any time, but sometimes permits more
# threads to execute temporarily for best performance.
#
# The algorithm works in the following manner:
#
# 		) Each thread group has a listener thread that listens for incoming statements from the connections assigned to the group.
#
# 	 	  When a statement arrives, the thread group either begins executing it immediately or queues it for later execution:
#
# 				) Immediate execution occurs if the statement is the only one received and no statements are queued or currently executing.
#
# 				) Queueing occurs if the statement cannot begin executing immediately.
#
# 		) If immediate execution occurs, execution is performed by the listener thread.
#
# 		  (This means that temporarily no thread in the groups is listening.)
# 			
# 			If the statement finishes quickly, the executing thread returns to listening for statements.
#
# 			Otherwise, the thread pool considers the statement stalled and starts another thread as a listener thread
# 			(creating it if necessary).
#
# 			To ensure that no thread group becomes blocked by stalled statements, the thread pool has a background thread
# 			that regularly monitors thread group states.
#
# 			By using the listening thread to execute a statement that can begin immediately, there is no need to create 
# 			an additional thread if the statement finishes quickly.
#
# 			This ensures the most efficient execution possible in the case of a lower number of concurrent threads.
#
# 			When the thread pool plugin starts, it creates one thread per group (the listener thread), plus the background thread.
# 			Additional threads are created as necessary to execute statements.
#
# 		) The value of the thread_pool_stall_limit SYS_VAR determines the meaning of "finishes quickly" in the above points.
#
# 		  The default time before threads are considered stalled is 60ms but can be set to a maximum of 6s.
#
# 			This param is configurable to enable you to strike a balance appropiate for the server work load.
#
# 			Short wait values permited threads to start more quickly.
#
# 			Short values are also better for avoiding deadlock situations. Long wait time values are useful for workloads that
# 			include long-running statements, to avoid starting too many new statements while the current one is executing.
#
# 		) The thread pool focuses on limiting the number of concurrent short-running statements.
#
# 			Before an executing statement reaches the stall time, it prevents other statements from beginning to execution.
#
# 			If the statement executes past the stall time, it is permitted to continue but no longer prevents other statements
# 			from starting.
#
# 			In this way, the thread pool tries to ensure that in each thread group there is never more than one short-running statement,
# 			although, there might be multiple long-running statements.
#
# 			It is undesirable to let long-running statements prevent other statements from executing because there is no limit on the amount
# 			of waiting that might be necessary.
#
# 			For example, on a replication master, a thread that is sending binary log events to a slave effectively runs forever.
#
# 		) A statement becomes blocked if it encounters a disk I/O operation or a user level lock (row lock or table lock).
#
# 		  The block would cause the thread group to become unused, so there are callbacks to the thread pool to ensure that
# 			the thread pool can immediately start a new thread in this group to execute another statement.
#
# 			When a blocked thread returns, the thread pool permits it to restart immediately.
#
# 		) There are two queues, a high prio queue and a low prio queue.
#
# 			The first statement in a transaction goes to the low-prio queue. 
#
# 			Any following statements for the transaction go to the high prio queue if the transaction is ongoing
# 			(statements for it have begun executing), or to the low-priority queue otherwise.
#
# 			Queue assignment can be affected by enabling the thread_pool_high_priority_connection SYS_VAR,
# 			which causes all queued statements for a session to go into the high prio queue.
#
# 			Statements for a nontransactional storage engine, or a transactional engine if autocommit is enabled,
# 			are treated as low-prio statements because in this case each statement is a transaction.
#
# 			Thus, given a mix of statements for InnoDB and MyISAM tables, the thread pool prios those for InnoDB
# 			over those for MyISAM unless autocommit is enabled.
#
# 			With autocommit enabled, all statements will be low prio.
#
# 		) When the thread group selects a queued statement for execution, it first looks in the high-priority queue, then in the
# 		  low prio queue.
#
# 			If a statement is found, it is removed from its queue and begins to execute.
#
# 		) If a statement stays in the low prio queue for too long, the thread pool moves it to the high prio queue.
#
# 			The value of the thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer SYS_VAR controls the time before movement.
#
# 			For each thread group, a max of one statement per 10ms or 100 per second will be moved from the low prio queue
# 			to the high prio queue.
#
# 		) The thread pool reuses the most active threads to obtain a much better use of CPU caches. This is a small adjustment that
# 			has a great impact on performance.
#
# 		) While a thread executes a statement from a user connection, Performance Schema instrumentation accounts thread activity
# 		  to the user connection.
#
# 			Otherwise, Performance Schema accounts actvitiy to the thread pool.
#
# Here are examples of conditions under which a thread group might have multiple threads started to execute statements:
#
# 		) One thread begins executing a statement, but runs long enough to be considered stalled.
#
# 		The thread group permits another thread to begin executing another statement even though the first thread is doing it's job.
#
# 		) One thread begins executing a statement, then becomes blocked and reports this back to the thread pool.
#
# 			The thread group permits another thread to begin executing another statement.
#
# 		) One thread begins executing a statement, becomes blocked, but does not report back that it is blocked because the
# 		  block does not occur in code that has been instrumented with thread pool callbacks.
#
# 			In this case, teh thread appears to the thread group to be still running.
#
# 			If the block lasts long enough for the statement to be considered stalled, the group permits another thread to begin
# 			executing another statement.
#
# The thread pool is designed to be scalable across an increasing number of connections. It is also designed to avoid
# deadlocks that can arise from limiting the number of actively executing statements.
#
# It is important that threads that do not report back to the thread pool do not prevent other statements from executing
# and thus causes the thread pool to become deadlocked.
#
# Examples of such statements are:
#
# 		) Long running statements. These would lead to all resources only used by a few statements, and they could prevent all others from accessing the server.
#
# 		) Binary log dump threads that read the binary log and sends it to slaves.
#
# 			This is a kind of long running "statement" (i.e, constantly) that runs for a very long time, and should not prevent other statements from executing.
#
# 		) Statements blocked on a row lock, table lock, sleep or any other blocking acvitiy that has not been reported back to the thread pool by MySQL
# 			Server or a storage engine.
#
# In each case, to prevent deadlock, the statement is moved to the stalled category when it does not complete quickly,
# so that the thread group can permit another statement to begin executing.
#
# With this design, when a thread executes or becomes blocked for an extended time, the thread pool moves the thread to the stalled category
# and for the rest of the statements execution,, it does not prevent other statements from executing.
#
# The max number of threads that can occur is the sum of max_connections and thread_pool_size.
#
# This can happen in a situation where all connections are in execution mode and an extra thread is created per group
# to listen for more statements.
#
# It can happen, albeit not very feasible.
#
# The following pertains to Thread Pool Tuning:
#
# This section provides guidelines on setting thread pool system variables for best performance, measured using a metric such as trans/sec.
#
# thread_pool_size is the most important parameter controlling thread pool performance.
# It cna be set only at server startup.
#
# Our experience in testing the thread pool indicates the following:
#
# 	) If the primary storage engine is InnoDB, the optimal thread_pool_size setting is likely between 16 and 36, with the most common
# 	  optimal values leaning towards 26 - 36. We have not seen any situation where the setting has been optiomal beyond 36.
#
# 	  There may be special cases where  avalue of smaller than 16 is optimal.
#
# 		For workloads such as DBT2 and Sysbench, the optimum for InnoDB seems to be usually around 36.
#
# 		For very write-intensive workloads, the optimal setting can sometimes be lower.
#
# 	) If the primary storage engine is MyISAM the thread_pool_Size setting should be fairly low.
#
# 		We tend to get optimal performance for values from 4 to 8.
#
# 		Higher values tend to have slightly negative but not dramatic impact on performance.
#
# Another SYS_VAR, thread_pool_stall_limit, is important for handling of blocked and long-running statements.
#
# If all calls that block the MySQL Server are reported to the thread pool, it would always know when execution
# threads are blocked.
#
# However, this may not always be true. For example, blocks could occur in code that has not been instrumented with
# thread pool callbacks.
#
# For such cases, the thread pool must be able to identify threads that appear to be blocked.
#
# This is done by means of a timeout, the length of which can be tuned using the thread_pool_stall_limit SYS_VAR.
#
# This parameter ensures that the server does not become completely blocked.
#
# The v alue of thread_pool_stall_limit has an upper limit of 6 seconds to prevent the risk of deadlock servers.
#
# thread_pool_stall_limit also enables the thread pool to handle long-running statements.
#
# If a long-running statement was permitted to block a thread group, all other connections assigned
# to the group would be blocked and unable to start execution until the long-running statements were completed.
#
# In the worst case, this could take hours or even days.
#
# The value of thread_pool_stall_limit should be chosen such that statements that execute longer than its value are
# considered stalled.
#
# Stalled statements generate a lot of extra overhead since they involve extra context switches and in some cases even
# extra thread creations.
#
# On the other hand, setting the thread_pool_stall_limit param too high means that long-running statements will block
# a number of short-running statements for longer than necessary.
#
# Short wait values permit threads to start more quickly.
#
# Short values are also better for avoiding deadlock situations. 
#
# Long wait values are useful for workloads that include long-running statements, to avoid starting
# too many new statements while the current one executes.
#
# Suppose a server executes a workload where almost all statements complete within 100ms even when the server is loaded,
# and the remaining statements take between 100ms and 2 hours fairly evenly spread.
#
# In this case, it would make sense to set thread_pool_stall_limit to 10 (meaning 100ms).
# The default value of 60ms is okay for servers that primarily execute very simple statements.
#
# The thread_pool_stall_limit PARAM can be changed at runtime to enable you to strike a balance appropiate for the
# server work load.
#
# Assuming that the tp_thread_group_stats table is enabled, you can use the following query to determine the fraction
# of executed statements that stalled:
#
# SELECT SUM(STALLED_QUERIES_EXECUTED) / SUM(QUERIES_EXECUTED) FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_group_stats;
#
# This number should be as low as possible. To decrease the likelihood of statements stalling, increase the value of
# thread_pool_stall_limit. 
#
# When a statement arrives, what is the max value time it can be delayed before it actually starts executing?
#
# Assume:
#
# ) htere are 200 statements queued in the low prio
#
# ) There are 10 statements queued in the high prio queue
#
# ) thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer is set to 10K (10 sec)
#
# ) thread_pool_stall_limit is set to 100 (1 sec)
#
# In the worst case, the 10 high prio statements present 10 tranactions that continue executing for a long time.
#
# Thus, worst case, no statements will be moved to high prio - because it's always awaiting an execution of a statement.
#
# After 10 seconds, the new statement is eligible to be moved to high prio.
#
# However, before it can move - all statements before it must be moved as well.
#
# This could take anotehr 2 sec because a max of 100 statements per sec are moved to high prio queue.
#
# Now when the statement reaches the high prio queue, there could potentionally be many long-running statements
# ahead of it.
#
# In the worst case, everyone of those will become stalled and take 1 second each before the next statement is retrieved
# from the high prio queue.
#
# Thus - in that scenario, it would take 222 seconds before the new statements starts executing.

# The following pertains to The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin
#
# MySQL supports query rewrite plugins that can examine and possibly modify SQL statements received by the server before the
# server executes them.
#
# MySQL distribs include a postparse query rewrite plugin named Rewriter and scripts for installing the plugin and its associated components.
# These components work together to provide statement-rewriting capability:
#
# 		) A server-side plugin named Rewriter examines statements and may rewrite them, based on its in-memory cache of rewrite rules.
#
# 		) These statements are subject to rewriting:
#
# 			) >= 8.0.12 -> SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE and DELETE
#
# 			) < 8.0.12 -> SELECT
#
# 		  Standalone statements and prepared-statements are subject to rewriting. Statements occuring within view definitions or stored programs
# 		  are not subject to rewriting.
#
# 		) The Rewriter plugin uses a database named query_rewrite containing a table named rewrite_rules.
#
# 			The table provides persistent storage for the rules that the plugin uses to decide whether to rewrite statements.
#
# 			Users communicate with the plugin by modifying the set of rules stoed in this table.
#
# 			The plugin communicates with users by setting the message column of table rows.
#
# 		) The query_rewrite DB contains a stored procedure named flush_rewrite_rules() that loads the contents of the rules table into the plugin.
#
# 		) A user defined function named load_rewrite_rules() is used by the flush_rewrite_rules() stored procedure.
#
# 		) The Rewriter plugin exposes SYS_VARs that enable plugin configuration and STATUS vars that provide runtime operational information.
#
# The following section describes how to install and use the Rewriter plugin.
#
# The following pertains to Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		If installed, the Rewriter plugin involves some overhead even when disabled. To avoid this overhead, do not install the plugin lest you intend to use it.
#
# To install or uninstall the Rewriter query rewrite plugin, choose the appropriate script located in the share directory of your MysQL app:
#
# 		install_rewriter.sql : Choose this script to install the Rewriter plugin and its associated components.
#
# 		uninstall_rewriter.sql : Choose this script to uninstall the Rewriter plugin and its associated components.
#
# Run the chosen scripts as follows:
#
# 		mysql -u root -p < install_rewriter.sql
# 		Enter PW (root PW here)
#
# The example here uses the install_rewriter.sql installation script.
# 
# To verify that it is installed and enabled, run this statement:
#
# 		SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'rewriter_enabled';
# 
# 		+----------------------------------+
# 		| Variable_name 		| Value 		  |
# 		+--------------------+-------------+
# 		| rewriter_enabled 	| ON 			  |
# 		+--------------------+-------------+
#
# The following pertains to how to Use the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin:
#
# To enable or disable the plugin, enable or disable the rewriter_enabled SYS_VAR.
#
# By default, the Rewriter plugin is enabled when you install it.
# To set the initial plugin state explicitly, you can set the variable at server startup.
#
# For example, to enable the plugin in an option file - use these lines:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		rewriter_enabled=ON
#
# It is also possible to enable or disable the plugin at runtime:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL rewriter_enabled = ON;
# 		SET GLOBAL rewriter_enabled = OFF;
#
# Assuming that the Rewriter plugin is enabled, it examines and possibly modifies each rewritable statement received by the server.
#
# The plugin determines whether to rewrite statements based on its in-memory cache of rewriting rules, which are loaded from the
# rewrite_rules table in the query_rewrite DB.
#
# These statements are subject to rewriting:
#
# 		>= 8..0.12 : SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE and DELETE
#
# 		< 8.0..12 : SELECT
#
# Standalone statements and prepared statements are subject to rewriting.
#
# Statements occuring within view defs or stored programs are not subject to rewriting.
#
# ADDING REWRITE RULES
#
# To add rules for the Rewriter plugin, add rows to the rewrite_rules table, then invoke the flush_rewrite_rules() stored procedure
# to load the rules from the table into the plugin.
#
# The following example creates a simple rule to match statements that select a single literal value:
#
# INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules (pattern, replacement)
# VALUES('SELECT ?', 'SELECT ? + 1');
#
# The resulting table contents will look as follows:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM query_rewrite.rewrite_rules\G
# 		****************************** 1. row ******************************
# 									id: 1
# 							pattern: SELECT ?
# 					pattern_database: NULL
# 				replacement: 		SELECT ? + 1
# 				enabled: 			YES
# 				MESSAGE: 			NULL
# 				pattern_digest: 	NULL
# 			normalized_pattern:  NULL
#
# The rule specifies a pattern template indicating which SELECT statements to match and a replacement template indicating how to
# rewrite matching statements.
#
# However, adding rules to the rewrite_rules table is not sufficient to cause the Rewriter plugin to use the rule.
# You must invoke the flush_rewrite_rules() to load the table contents into the plugin in-memory cache:
#
# 		CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
#
# TIP: 
# 		If your rewrite rules seem not to be working properly, make sure that you have reloaded the rules by calling the flush_rewrite_rules()
#
# When the plugin reads each rule from the rules table, it computes a normalized (statement digest) form from the pattern and a digest
# hash value, and uses them to update the normalized_pattern and pattern_digest column:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM query_rewrite.rewrite_rules\G
# 		************************** 1. row ****************************
# 										id: 1
# 								pattern: SELECT ?
# 					pattern_database: NULL
# 						replacement:  	SELECT ? + 1
# 							enabled: 	YES
# 								message: NULL
# 					  pattern_digest: <digest>
# 				 normalized_pattern: select ?
#
# If a rule cannot be loaded due to some error, calling flush_rewrite_rules() produces an error:
#
# 		CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
# 		ERROR 1644 (45000): Loading of some rule(s) failed.
#
# When this occurs, the plugin writes an error message to the message column of the rule row to communicate the problem.
# Check the rewrite_rules table for rows with non-NULL message column values to see what problems exist.
#
# Patterns use the same syntax as prepared statements. Within a pattern template, ? chars act as param markes that match
# data values.
#
# Param markers can be used only where data values should appear, not for SQL keywords, identifiers and so forth.
# The ? characters should not be enclosed within quotation marks.
#
# Like the pattern, the replacement can contain ? chars. For a statement that matches a pattern template,
# the plugin rewrites it, replacing the ? param marker in the replacement using data values matched by the
# corresponding markers in the pattern.
#
# The result is a complete statement string.
#
# The plugin asks the server to parse it, and returns the results to the server as the representaiton of the rewritten statement.
#
# After adding and loading the rule, check whether rewriting occurs according to whether statements match the rule pattern:
#
# 		SELECT PI();
# 		+----------------+
# 		| PI() 			  |
# 		+----------------+
# 		| 3.141593 		  |
# 		+----------------+
# 		1 row in set (0.01 sec)
#
# 		SELECT 10;
# 		+------------+
# 		| 10 + 1 	 |
# 		+------------+
# 		| 			11  |
# 		+------------+
#
# 		1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
#
# No rewriting occurs for hte first, but does for the second.
#
# The second statement illustrates that when the Rewriter plugin rewrites a statement, it produces a 
# warning message.
#
# To view the message, use SHOW WARNINGS:
#
# SHOW WARNINGS\G
# ***************************** 1. row ********************************
#
# 		Level: Note
# 		 Code: 1105
# 	 Message: Query 'SELECT 10' rewritten to 'SELECT 10 + 1' by a query rewrite plugin
#
# A statement need not be rewritten to a statement of the same type.
# The following example loads a rule that rewrites DELETE statements to UPDATE statements:
#
# 		INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules (pattern, replacement)
# 		VALUES('DELETE FROM db1.t1 WHERE col = ?',
# 				 'UPDATE db1.t1 SET col = NULL WHERE col = ?');
# 		CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
#
# To enable or disable an existing rule, modify its enabled column and reload the table into the plugin.
# To disable rule 1:
#
# 		UPDATE query_rewrite.rewrite_rules SET enabled = 'NO' WHERE id = 1;
# 		CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
#
# This enables you to deactive a rule without removing it from a table.
#
# To re-enable rule 1:
#
# 		UPDATE query_rewrite.rewrite_rules SET enabled = 'YES' WHERE id = 1;
# 		CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
#
# The rewrite_rules table contains a pattern_database column that Rewriter uses for matching table names that are not 
# qualified with a database name:
#
# 		) Qualified table names in statements match qualified names in the pattern if corresponding database and table names are identical
#
# 		) Unqualified table names in statements match unqualified names in the pattern only if the default database is the same as pattern_database
# 		  and the table names are identical.
#
# Suppose that a table named appdb.users has a column named id and that application are expected to select rows from the
# table using a query of one of these forms, when the secondary can be used only if appdb is the default db:
#
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE appdb.id = id_value;
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = id_value; #can only be used if appdb is default DB
#
# Suppose also that the id column is renamed to user_id (perhaps the table must be modified to add another type of ID and it is
# necessary to indicate more specifically what type of ID the id column represents).
#
# The change means that applications must refer to user_id rather than id in the WHERE clause.
#
# But if there are old applications that cannot be written to change the SELECT queries they generate, they will no longer
# work properly.
#
# The Rewriter plugin can solve this problem.
#
# To match and rewrite statements whether or not they qualify the table name, add the following two rules and reload the rules table:
#
# 		INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules
# 			(pattern, replacement) VALUES(
# 			'SELECT * FROM appdb.users WHERE id = ?',
# 			'SELECT * FROM appdb.users WHERE user_id = ?'
# 			);
# 		INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules
# 			(pattern, replacement, pattern_database) VALUES(
# 			'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?',
# 			'SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?',
# 			'appdb'
# 			);
# 		CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
#
# Rewriter uses the first rule to match statements that use the qualified table name.
#
# It uses the second to match statements that used the unqualified name, but only if the
# default DB is appdb (the value in pattern_database)
#
# HOW STATEMENTS MATCHING WORKS
#
# The Rewriter plugin uses statement digests and digest hash values to match incoming statements against rewrite rules in stages.
# The max_digest_length SYS_VAR determines the size of the buffer used for computing statement digests.
#
# Larger values enable computation of digests that distinguish longer statements.
#
# Smaller values use less memory but increase the likelihood of longer statements coliding with the same digest value.
#
# The plugin matches each statement to the rewrite rules as follows:
#
# 		1. Compute the statement digest hash value and compare it to the rule digest hash values.
#
# 			This is subject to false positives, but serves as a quick rejection test.
#
# 		2. If the statement digest hash value matches any pattern digest hash value, match the normalized (statement digest) form of the
# 			statement to the normalized form of the matching rule patterns.
#
# 		3. If the normalized statement matches a rule, compare the literal values in the statement and the pattern .
#
# 			A ? char in the pattern matches any literal value in the statement.
#
# 			If the statement prepares a statement, ? in teh pattern also matches ? in the statement.
#
# 			Otherwise, corresponding literals must be the same.
#
# If multiple rules match a statement, it is nondeterminsitic which one the plugin uses to rewrite the statement.
#
# If a pattern contains more markers than the replacement, the plugin discards excess data values.
#
# If a pattern contains fewer markers than the replacement, it is an error.
#
# The plugin notices this when the rules table is loaded, writes an error message to the message column of the rule row to communicate
# the problem, and sets the Rewriter_reload_error status variable to ON. 			 
#
# REWRITING PREPARED STATEMENTS
#
# Prepared statements are rewritten at parse time (that is, when they are prepared), not when they are executed later.
#
# Prepared statements differ from nonprepared statements in that they may contain ? chars as param markers.
# To match a ? in a prepared statement, a Rewriter pattern must contain ? in the same location.
#
# Suppose that a rewrite rule has this pattern:
#
# 		SELECT ?, 3
#
# The following table showcases several prepared SELECT statements and whether the rule pattern matches them.
#
# 		PREPARED STATEMENT 						WHETHER PATTERN MATCHES STATEMENT
#
# 		PREPARE s AS 'SELECT 3,3' 				Yes
# 		PREPARE s AS 'SELECT ?,3' 				Yes
# 		PREPARE s AS 'SELECT 3, ?' 			No
# 		PREPARE s AS 'SELECT ?, ?' 			No -> Won't go through, as prepared statement must have ? in the same placement as Statement, i.e ?,3 is invalid
#
# REWRITER PLUGIN OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
#
# The Rewriter plugin makes information available about its operation by means of several status variables:
#
# 		SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Rewriter%';
#
# 		+---------------------------------------------+
# 		| Variable_name 							| Value 	 |
# 		+-----------------------------------+---------+
# 		| Rewriter_number_loaded_rules 		| 1 		 |
# 		| Rewriter_number_reloads 				| 5 		 |
# 		| Rewriter_number_rewritten_queries | 1		 |
# 		| Rewriter_reload_error 				| ON 		 |
# 		+-----------------------------------+---------+
#
# When you load the rules table by calling the flush_rewrite_rules() stored procedure, if an error occurs for some rule,
# the CALL statement produces an error, and the plugin sets the Rewriter_reload_error status variable to ON:
#
# 		CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
# 		ERROR 1644 (45000): Loading of some rule(s) failed.
#
# 		SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Rewriter_reload_error';
# 		+--------------------------------+-------+
# 		| Variable_name 						| Value |
# 		+--------------------------------+-------+
# 		| Rewriter_reload_error 			| ON 	  |
# 		+--------------------------------+-------+
#
# In this case, check the rewrite_rules table for rows with non-NULL message column values to see what problems exist.
#
# Rewriter Plugin Use of Character Sets
#
# When the rewrite_rules table is loaded into the Rewriter plugin, the plugin interprets statements using the
# current global value of the character_set_client SYS_VAR.
#
# If the global character_set_client value is changed subsequently, the rules must be reloaded.
#
# A client must have a session character_set_client value identical to what the global value was when the rules table
# was loaded or rule matching will not work for that client.
#
# The following pertains to REWRITER QUERY REWRITE PLUGIN REFERENCE
#
# The following discussion serves as a reference to these components associated with the Rewriter query rewrite plugin:
#
# 		) The Rewriter rules table in the query_rewrite database
#
# 		) Rewriter procedures and functions
#
# 		) Rewriter system and status variables
#
# Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin Rules Table
#
# The rewrite_rules table in the query_rewrite DB provides a persistent storage for the rules that the Rewriter plugin uses
# to decide whether to rewrite statements.
#
# Users communicate with the plugin by modifying the set of rules stored in this table. The plugin communicates information to users
# by setting the table's message column.
#
# 		NOTE:
#
# 			The rules table is loaded into the plugin by the flush_rewrite_rules stored procedure.
#
# 			Unless the procedure has been called following the most recent table modification,
# 			the table contents do not necessarily correspond to the set of rules the plugin is using.
#
# The rewrite_rules table has these columns:
#
# 		) id
#
# 			The rule ID. This column is the table primary key. You can use the ID to uniquely identify any rule.
#
# 		) pattern
#
# 			The template that indicates the pattern for statements that the rule matches.
# 			Use ? to represent param markers that match data values.
#
# 		) pattern_database
#
# 			The database used to match unqualified table names in statements.
#
# 			Qualified table names in statements match qualified names in the pattern if corresponding database and table names are identical.
#
# 			Unqualified table names in statements match unqualified names in the pattern only if the default database is the same as 
# 			pattern_database and the table names are identical.
#
# 		) replacement
#
# 			The template that indicates how to rewrite statements matching the pattern column value.
#
# 			Use ? to represent param markers that match data values.
#
# 			In rewritten statements, the plugin replaces ? param markers in replacement using data values matched by
# 			the corresponding markers in pattern.
#
# 		) enabled
#
# 			Whether the rule is enabled. Load operations (performed by invoking the flush_rewrite_rules() stored procedure) load the rule
# 			from the table into the Rewriter in-memory cache only if this column is YES.
#
# 			This column makes it possible to deactivate a rule without removing it.
# 			Set the column value to something other than YES and reload the table into the plugin.
#
# 		) message
#
# 			The plugin uses this column for communicating with users.
#
# 			If no error occurs when the rules table is loaded into memory, the plugin sets the message column to NULL.
# 
# 			A non-NULL value indicates an error and the column contents are the error message.
# 			Errors can occur under these circumstances:
#
# 				) Either the pattern or the replacement is an incorrect SQL statement that produces syntax errors.
#
# 				) The replacement contains more ? params markers than the pattern.
#
# 			If a load error occurs, the plugin also sets the Rewriter_reload_error STATUS_VAR to ON.
#
# 		) pattern_digest
#
# 			This column is used for debugging and diagnostics.
#
# 			If the column exists when the rules table is loaded into memory, the plugin updates
# 			it with the pattern digest.
#
# 			This column may be useful if you are trying to determine why some statement fails to be rewritten.
#
# 		) normalized_pattern
#
# 			This column is used for debugging and diagnostics. 
#
# 			If the column exists when the rules table is loaded into memory, the plugin updates it with the normalized
# 			form of the pattern.
#
# 			This column may be useful if you are trying to determine why some statement fails to be rewritten.
#
# REWRITER QUERY REWRITE PLUGIN PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS
#
# Rewriter plugin operation uses a stored procedure that loads the rules table into its in-memory cache, and a helper
# user-defined function (UDF).
#
# Under normal operation, users invoke only the stored procedure.
#
# The UDF is intended to be invoked by the stored procedure, not directly by users.
#
# 		) flush_rewrite_rules()
#
# 			This stored procedure uses the load_rewrite_rules() UDF to load the contents of the rewrite_rules table
# 			into the Rewriter in-memory cache.
#
# 			Calling flush_rewrite_rules() implies COMMIT.
#
# 			Invoke this procedure after you modify the rules table to cause the plugin to update its cache from the
# 			new table contents.
#
# 			If any errors occur, the plugin sets the message column for the appropriate rule rows in the table and
# 			sets the Rewriter_reload_error status variable to ON.
#
# 		) load_rewrite_rules()
#
# 			This UDF is a helper routine used by the flush_rewrite_rules() stored procedure.
#
# REWRITER QUERY REWRITE PLUGIN SYS_VARs
#
# The Rewriter query rewrite plugins support the following SYS_VARs.
# These variables are available only if the plugin is installed.
#
# 		) rewriter_enabled
#
# 			SYS_VAR 					rewriter_enabled
# 			Scope: 					Global
# 			Dynamic: 					Yes
# 			SET_VAR Hint applies: 	 No
# 			Type: 					Boolean
# 			Default: 				 	 ON
#
# 			Whether the Rewriter query rewrite plugin is enabled.
#
# 		) rewriter_verbose
#
# 			SYS_VAR 					rewriter_verbose
# 			Scope: 					Global
# 			Dynamic: 				   Yes
# 			SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 			Type: 						INteger
#
# 			For internal use.
#
# REWRITER QUERY REWRITE PLUGIN STATUS VARS
#
# The Rewriter query rewrite plugin supports the following status vars.
#
# These variables are available only if the plugin is installed.
#
# 			) Rewriter_number_loaded_rules
#
# 				THe number of rewrite plugin rewrite rules successfully loaded from the rewrite_rules table into memory for use by the Rewriter plugin.
#
# 			) Rewriter_number_reloads
#
# 				The number of times the rewrite_rules table has been loaded into the in-memory cache used by the Rewriter plugin
#
# 			) Rewriter_number_rewritten_queries
#
# 				The number of queries rewritten by the Rewriter query rewrite plugin since it was loaded.
#
# 			) Rewriter_reload_error
#
# 				Whether an error occurred the most recent time that the rewrite_rules table was loaded into the in-memory
# 				cache used by the Rewriter plugin.
#
# 				If the value is OFF, no error occured.
#
# 				If the value is ON, an error occured.
#
# 				Check the messages column of the rewriter_rules table for error messages.
#
# VERSION TOKENS
#
# MySQL includes Version Tokens, a feature that enables creation of and synchronization around server tokens that applications
# can use to prevent accessing incorrect or out-of-date Data.
#
# The Version Tokens interface has these characteristics::
#
# 		) Version tokens are pairs consisting of a name that servers as a key or identifier, plus a value
#
# 		) Version tokens can be locked. An application can use token locks to indicate to other cooperating applications that tokens are in used and
# 			should not be modified.
#
# 		) Version token lists are established per server; for example, to specify the server assignment or operational state.
#
# 			In addition, an application that communicates with a server can register its own list of tokens that indicate the state
# 			it requires the server to be in.
#
# 			An SQL statement sent by the application to a server not in the required state produces an error.
#
# 			This is a signal to the application that it should seek a different server in the required state to receive
# 			the SQL statement.
#
# The following section describes the components of Version Tokens, discuss how to install and use them, and provides refernce.
#
# VERSION TOKEN COMPONENTS
#
# Version Tokens is based on a plugin library that implements these components:
#
# 		) A server-side plugin named version_tokens holds the list of version tokens associated with the server and subscribes to
# 		  notifications for statement execution events.
#
# 		  The version_tokens plugin uses the audit plugin API to monitor incoming statements from clients and matches each client's
# 			session-specific version token list against the server version token list.
#
# 			If there is a match, the plugin lets the statement through and the server continues to process it.
#
# 			Otherwise, the plugin returns an error to the client and the statement fails.
#
# 		) A set of user-defined functions (UDFs) provides an SQL-level API for manipulating and inspecting the list of server version
# 		  tokens maintained by the plugin.
#
# 			The VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN or SUPER privs is required to call any of the Version Token UDFs.
#
# 		) When the version_tokens plugin loads, it defines the VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN dynamic privilege.
#
# 			This priv can be granted to users of the UDFs.
#
# 		) A SYS_VAR enables clients to specify the list of version tokens that registers the required server state.
#
# 			If the server has a different state when a client sends a statement, the client receives an error.
#
# INSTALLING OR UNINSTALLING VERSION TOKENS
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		If installed, Version Tokens involves some overhead. To avoid this, do not install lest you plan to use them.
#
# This section describes how to install or uninstall Version Tokens, which is implemented in a plugin library file containing
# a plugin and user-defined functions (UDFs).
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin dir (the dir named by the plugin_dir SYS_VAR)
# If necessary, configure the plugin dir location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# The plugin library file base name is version_tokens. The file name suffix differs per platform (for example, .so for Unix
# and Unix-like systems. .dll for Windows)
#
# To install the Version Token plugin and UDFs, use the INSTALL_PLUGIN and CREATE_FUNCTION statements (adjust the .so suffix for your platform, if needed):
#
# 		INSTALL PLUGIN version_tokens SONAME 'version_token.so';
# 		CREATE FUNCTION version_tokens_set RETURNS STRING
# 			SONAME 'version_token.so';
# 		CREATE FUNCTION version_tokens_show RETURNS STRING
# 			SONAME 'version_token.so';
#
#  	CREATE FUNCTION version_tokens_edit RETURNS STRING
# 			SONAME 'version_token.so';
# 		CREATE FUNCTION version_tokens_delete RETURNS STRING
# 			SONAME 'version_token.so';
#
# 		CREATE FUNCTION version_tokens_lock_shared RETURNS INT
# 			SONAME 'version_token.so';
# 		CREATE FUNCTION version_tokens_lock_exclusive RETURNS INT
# 			SONAME 'version_token.so';
#
# 		CREATE FUNCTION version_tokens_unlock RETURNS INT
# 			SONAME 'version_token.so';
#
# You must install the UDFs to manage the server's version token list, but you must also install the plugin ebcause the UDFs will
# not work correctly without it.
#
# If the plugin and UDFs are used on a master replication server, install them on all slave servers as well to avoid replication problems.
#
# Once installed as just described, the plugin and UDFs remain installed until uninstalled.
# To remove them, use the UNINSTALL_PLUGIN and DROP_FUNCTION statements:
#
# 		UNINSTALL PLUGIN version_tokens;
# 		DROP FUNCTION version_tokens_set;
# 		DROP FUNCTION version_tokens_show;
# 		DROP FUNCTION version_tokens_edit;
#
# 		DROP FUNCTION version_tokens_delete;
# 		DROP FUNCTION version_tokens_lock_shared;
# 		DROP FUNCTION version_tokens_lock_exclusive;
# 		DROP FUNCTION version_tokens_unlock;
#
# USING VERSION TOKENS
#
# Before using Version Tokens, install it according to the previous section.
#
# A scenario in which Version Tokens can be useful is a system that accesses a collection of MySQL servers but needs
# to manage them for load balancing purposes by monitoring them and adjusting server assignments according to load changes.
#
# Such a system comprises these components:
#
# 		) The collection of MySQL servers to be managed
#
# 		) An administrative or management application that communicates with the servers and organizes them into high-availability groups.
# 			Groups serve different purposes, and servers within each group may have different assignments.
#
# 			Assignment of a server within a certain group can change at any time.
#
# 		) Client applications that access the servers to retrieve and update data, choosing servers according to the purposes assigned them.
# 			For example, a client should not send an update to a read-only server.
#
# Version Tokens permit server access to be managed according to assignment without requiring clients to repeatedly query the servers about
# their assignments:
#
# 		) The management application performs server assignments and establishes version tokens on each server to reflect its assignment.
# 			The application caches this information to provide a central access point to it.
#
# 			If at some point the management application needs to change a server assignment (for example, to change it from permitting writes to
# 			read only), it changes the server's version token list and updates its cache.
#
# 		) To improve performance, client applications obtain cache information from the management application, enabling them to avoid
# 			having to retrieve information about server assignments for each statement.
#
# 			Based on the type of statements it will issue (for example, reads versus writes), a client selects an appropiate server and connects to it.
#
# 		) In addition, the client sends to the server its own client-specific version tokens to register the assignment it requires of the server.
# 			For each statement sent by the client to the server, the server compares its own token list with the client token list.
#
# 			If the server token list contains all tokens present in the client token list with the same values, there is a match and the server
# 			executes the statement.
#
# 			ON the other hand, perhaps the management application has changed the server assignment and its version token list.
#
# 			IN this case, teh new server assignment may now be incompatible with the client requirements.
#
# 			A token mismatch between the server and client token list occurs and the server returns an error in reply to the
# 			statement.
#
# 			This is an indication to the client ot refresh its version token information from the management application cache,
# 			and to select a new server to communicate with.
#
# The client-side logic for detecting version token errors and selecting a new server can be implemented in different ways:
#
#  		) The client can handle all version token registration, mismatch detection and connection switching itself.
#
# 			) The logic for those actions can be implemented in a connector that manages connections between clients and MySQL servers.
# 				Such a connector might handle mismatch error detection and statemnet resending itself, or it might pass the error to the
# 				application and leave it to the application to resent the statement.
#
# The following example illustrates the preceding discussion in concrete form.
#
# When Version Tokens initialize on a given server, the server's version token list is empty.
# Token list maintenance is performed by calling user-defined functions (UDFs).
#
# The VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN or SUPER privs is required to call any of the Version Token UDFs, so token list
# modification is expected to be done by management or administrative application that has that priv.
#
# Suppose that a management app communicates with a set of services that are queried by clients to access employee and product DBs
# (named emp and prod, respectively)
#
# All servers are permitted to process data retrieveal statements, but only some of them are permitted to make DB updates.
#
# To handle this on a DB specific basis, the management application establishes a list of version tokens on each server.
#
# In the token list for a given server, token names represent database names and token values are read or write
# depending on wether the database must be used in read-only fashion or whether it can take reads and wrties.
#
# Client applications register a list of version tokens they require the server to match by setting a SYS_VAR.
# Variable settings occurs on a client-specific basis, so different clients can register different requirements.
#
# By default, the client token list is empty, which matches any server token list.
# When a client sets its token list to a nonempty value, matching may succeed or fail, depending on the server version token list.
#
# To define the version token list for a server, the management application calls the version_tokens_set() UDF.
# (There are also UDFs for modifying and displaying the token list, later)
#
# For example, the app might send these statements to a group of three servers:
#
# SERVER 1:
#
# SELECT version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=read');
# +--------------------------------------------+
# | version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=read')   |
# +´-------------------------------------------+
# | 2 version tokens set. 							  |
# +--------------------------------------------+
#
# SERVER 2:
#
# SELECT version_tokens_set('emp=write;prod=read');
# +---------------------------------------------+
# | version_tokens_set('emp=write;prod=read') 	|
# +---------------------------------------------+
# | 2 version tokens set. 								|
# +---------------------------------------------+
#
# SERVER 3:
#
# SELECT version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=write');
# +---------------------------------------------+
# | version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=write') 	|
# +---------------------------------------------+
# | 2 version tokens set. 								|
# +---------------------------------------------+
#
# The token list in each case is specified as a semicolon-separated list of <name=value> pairs.
# The resulting token list values result in these server assignments:
#
# 		) Any server accepts reads for either DB
#
# 		) Only server 2 accepts updates for the emp DB
#
# 		) Only server 3 accepts updates for the prod database
#
# In addition to assigning each server a version token list, the management application also maintains a cache that
# reflects the server assignments.
#
# Before communicating with hte servers, a client application contacts the management application and retrieves information
# about server assignments.
#
# Then the client selects a server based on those assignments. Suppose that a client wants to perform both reads and writes
# on the emp database.
#
# Based on the preceding assignments, only server 2 qualifies.
#
# The client connects to server 2 and registers it server requirements there by setting its version_tokens_session SYS_VAR:
#
# 		SET @@SESSION.version_tokens_session = 'emp=write';
#
# For subsequent statements sent by the client to server 2, the server compares its own version token list to the client list
# to check whether they match.
#
# IF so, statements execute normally:
#
# 		UPDATE emp.employee SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 4981;
# 		Query OK, 1 row affected (0.07)
# 		Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
#
# 		SELECT last_name, first_name FROM emp.employee WHERE id = 4981;
# 		+-----------------+-------------------+
# 		| last_name 		| First_name 		  |
#  	+-----------------+-------------------+
# 		| Smith 				| Abe 				  |
# 		+-----------------+-------------------+
# 		1 row in set (0.01 sec)
# 	
# Discrepencies between the server and client version token lists can occur in two ways:
#
# 		) A token name in the version_tokens_session value is not present in the server token list.
# 			In this case, an ER_VTOKEN_PLUGIN_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND error occurs.
#
# 		) A token value in the version_tokens_session value differs from the value of the corresponding token in the 
# 			server token list. In this case, an ER_VTOKEN_PLUGIN_TOKEN_MISMATCH error occurs.
#
# As long as the assignment of server 2 does not change, the client continues to use it for reads and wrties.
# But suppose that hte management application wants to change server assignments so that writes for the emp db must be
# sent to server 1 instead of server 2.
#
# To do so, it uses version_tokens_edit() to modify the emp token vlaue on the two servers (and update its cache of server assignments):
#
# Server 1:
#
# 		SELECT version_tokens_edit('emp=write');
# 		+-----------------------------------------+
# 		| version_tokens_edit('emp=write') 			|
# 		+-----------------------------------------+
# 		| 1 version tokens updated. 					|
# 		+-----------------------------------------+
#
# Server 2:
#
# 		SELECT version_tokens_edit('emp=read');
# 		+-----------------------------------------+
# 		| version_tokens_edit('emp=read') 			|
# 		+-----------------------------------------+
# 		| 1 version tokens updated. 					|
# 		+-----------------------------------------+
#
# version_tokens_edit() modifies the named tokens in the server token list and leaves other tokens unchanged.
#
# The next time the client sends a statement to server 2, its own token list no longer matches the server token list
# and an error occurs:
#
# UPDATE emp.employee SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 4982;
# ERROR 3136 (42000): Version token mismatch for emp. Correct value read
#
# In this case, the client should contact the management application to obtain updated information about server assignments,
# select a new server, and send the failed statement to the new server.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Each client must cooperate with Version Tokens by sending only statements in accordance with the token list that it registers
# 		with a given server.
#
# 		For example, if a client registers a token list of 'emp=read', there is nothing in Version Tokens to prevent the client
# 		from sending updates for the emp db.
#
# 		The client itself must refrain from doing so.
#
# For each statement received from a client, the server implicitly uses locking, as follows:
#
# 		) Take a shared lock for each token named in the client token list (that is, in the version_tokens_session value)
#
# 		) Perform the comparison between the server and client token lists
#
# 		) Execute the statement or produce an error depending on the comparison result.
#
# 		) Release the locks
#
# The server uses shared locks so that comparisons for multiple sessions can occur without blocking, while preventing
# changes to the tokens for any session that attempts to acquire an exclusive lock before it manipulates tokens of the
# same names in the server tokens list.
#
# THe preceding example uses only a few of the user-defined values in the Version Tokens plugin library, but there are others.
# One set of UDFs permits the server's list of version tokens to be manipulated and inspected.
#
# Another set of UDF's permits version tokens to be locked and unlocked.
#
# These UDFs permit the server's list of version tokens to be created, changed, removed and inspected:
#
# 		) version_tokens_set() completely replaces the current list and assigns a new list.
#
# 			The argument is a semicolon-separated list of <name=value> pairs.
#
# 		) version_tokens_edit() enables partial modifications to the current list.
#
# 			It can add new tokens or change the values of existing tokens.
#
# 			The argument is a semicolon-separated list of <name=value> pairs.
#
# 		) version_tokens_delete() deletes tokens from the current list. The argument is a semicolon separated list of token names.
#
# 		) version_tokens_show() displays the current token list. It takes no argument.
#
# Each of those functions, if successful, returns a binary string indiating what action occurred.
#
# The following example establishes the server token list, modifies it by adding a new token, deletes some tokens,
# and displays the resulting token list:
#
# 		SELECT version_tokens_set('tok1=a;tok2=b;');
# 		+-------------------------------------------+
# 		| version_tokens_set('tok1=a;tok2=b') 		  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------+
# 		| 2 version tokens set. 						  |

#
# Version Tokens interprets the argument as follows:
#
# 		) Whitespace around names and values is ignored. Whitespace within names and values is permitted.
# 			(For version_tokens_delete(), which takes a list of names without values, whitespace around names is ignored)
#
# 		) There is no quoting mechanism
#
# 		) Order of tokens is not significant except that if a token list contains multiple instances of a given token name, the last 
# 			value takes precedence over earlier values.
#
# Given those rules, the preceding version_tokens_set() call results in a token list with two tokens:
#
# 		tok1 has the value 1'2 3"4 and tok2 has the value a = b.
#
# 		To verify this, just call version_tokens_show():
#
# 		SELECT version_tokens_show();
# 		+------------------------------+
# 		| version_tokens_show() 		 |
# 		+------------------------------+
# 		| tok2=a = b;tok1=1'2 3"4; 	 |
# 		+------------------------------+
#
# If the token list contains two tokens, why did version_tokens_set() return the value 3 version tokens set?
#
# Because tok1 was assigned twice.
#
# The Version Tokens token-manipulation UDFs place these constraints on token names and values:
#
# 		) Token names cannot contain = or ; characters and have a max length of 64 chars.
#
# 		) Token values cannot contain ; chars. Length of values is constrained by the value of the max_allowed_packet SYS_VAR.
#
# 		) Version Tokens treats token names and values as binary strings, so comparisons are case-sensitive.
#
# Version Tokens also include a set of UDFs enabling tokens to be locked and unlocked:
#
# 		) version_tokens_lock_exclusive() acquires exclusive version token locks. It takes a list of one or more lock names and a timeout value.
#
# 		) version_tokens_lock_shared() acquires shared version token locks. It takes a list of one or more lock names and a timeout value.
#
# 		) version_tokens_unlock() release version token locks (exclusive and shared). No args.
#
# Each locking function returns nonzero for success. Otherwise, an error occurs:
#
# 		SELECT version_tokens_lock_shared('lock1', 'lock2', 0);

#
# Locking using Version Tokens locking function is advisory, applications must agree to cooperate.
#
# It is possible to lock nonexisting token names. This does not create the tokens.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Version tokens locking functions are based on the locking service, described later.
# 		And thus must have the same semantics for shared and exclusive locks.
# 		(Version Tokens uses the locking service routines built into the server, not the locking
# 		service UDF interface, so those UDFs need not be installed to use Version Tokens).
#
# 		Locks acquired by Version Tokens use a locking service namespace of version_token_locks.
# 		Locking service locks can be monitored using the Performance Schema, so this is also true
# 		for Version Tokens Locks.
#
# For the Version Tokens locking functions, token name arguments are used exactly as specified.
#
# Surrounding whitespace is not ignored and = and ; chars are permitted.
#
# This is because the Version Tokens simply passes the token names to be locked as is to the locking service.

# 			name arguments is not ignored and = and ; chars are permitted.
#
# 		) it is possible to lock a nonexisting token name. Does not create the token.
#
# 		) Timeout values are nonnegative integer representing teh time in seconds to wait to acquire locks before timing out
# 			with an error.
#
# 			If the timeout is 0, there is no waiting and the function produces an error if locks cannot be acquired instantly.
#
# 		) Version Tokens locking functions are based on the locking service described later.
#
# VERSION TOKENS SYS_VARs
#
# Version tokens support the following SYS_VARs. These VARs are unavailable unless the Version Tokens plugin is installed.
#
# SYS_VARs:
#
# 			) version_tokens_session
#
# 				PROPERTY 				VALUE
# 				cmd line: 				--version-tokens-session=value
# 				Sys_Var: 				version_tokens_session
# 				Scope: 					Global, Session
# 				Dynamic: 				Yes
# 				SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 				Type: 					String
# 				Default: 				NULL
#
# 				The session value of this variable specifies the client version token list and indicates the tokens that hte client
# 				session requires the server version token list to have.
#
# 				If the version_tokens_session variable is NULL (the default), or has an empty value, any server version token list matches.
# 				(In effect, an empty value disables matching requirements)
#
# 				If the version_tokens_session variable has a nonempty value, any mismatch between its value and the server version token list results
# 				in an error for any statement the session sends to the server. A mismatch occurs under these conditions:
#
# 					) A token name in the version_tokens_session value is not present in the server token list. In this case, an ER_VTOKEN_PLUGIN_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND
# 						error occurs.
#
# 					) A token value in the version_tokens_session value differs from the value of the corresponding token in the server token list.
# 						In this case, an ER_VTOKEN_PLUGIN_TOKEN_MISMATCH error occurs.
#
# 				It is not a mismatch for the server version token list to include a token not named in the version_tokens_session value.
#
# 				Suppose that a management application has set the server token list as follows:
#
# 					SELECT version_tokens_set('tok1=a;tok2=b;tok3=c');
#  				+------------------------------------------------+
# 					| version_tokens_set('tok1=a;tok2=b;tok3=c') 	 |
# 					+------------------------------------------------+
# 					| 3 version tokens set 									 |
# 					+------------------------------------------------+
#
# 				A client registers the tokens it requires the server to match by setting its version_tokens_session value.
#
# 				Then, for each subsequent statement sent by the client, the server checks its token list against the client 
# 				version_tokens_session value and produces an error if there is a mismatch:
#
# 					SET @@SESSION.version_tokens_session = 'tok1=a;tok2=b';
# 					SELECT 1;
# 					+----+
# 					| 1  |
# 					+----+
#  				| 1  |

#
# 					SET @@SESSION.version_tokens_session = 'tok1=b';
# 					SELECT 1;
# 					ERROR 3136 (42000): Version token mismatch for tok1. Correct value a
#
# 				The first SELECT succeeds because the client tokens tok1 and tok2 are present in the server token list and
# 				each token has the same value in the server list.
#
# 				The second SELECT fails because, although tok1 is present in the server token list, it has a different
# 				value than specified by the client.
#
# 				At this point, any statement sent by the client fails, unless the server token list changes such that it matches again.
# 				Suppose that the management application changes the server token list as follows:
#
# 					SELECT version_tokens_edit('tok1=b');
# 					+-------------------------------------+
# 					| version_tokens_edit('tok1=b') 		  |

# 					| tok3=c;tok1=b;tok2=b; 	 |
# 					+---------------------------+
#
# 				Now the client version_tokens_session value matchhes the server token list and the client can once again successfully execute statements:

# MYSQL SERVER USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
#
# MySQL Server enables user-defined functions (UDFs) to be created and loaded into the server to extend server capabilities.
# Server capabilities can be implemented in whole or in part using UDFs.
#
# In addition, you can write your own UDFs.
# The following showcases how to install and uninstall UDFs, and how to determine at runtime which UDFs are installed and obtain info about them.
#
# INSTALLING AND UNINSTALLING USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
#
# User-defined functions (UDFs) must be loaded into the server before they can be used.
# MySQL supports UDF loading at runtime.
#
# To load a UDF, use the CREATE_FUNCTION statement. For example:
#
# 		CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME 'udf_example.so';
#
# The UDF file base name depends on your platform. Common suffixes are .so for Unix and Unix-based systems., .dll for Windows.
#
# While a UDF is loaded, information about it is available from the Performance Schema user_defined_functions table.
#
# The statement also registers the UDF in the mysql.func SYSTEM table to cause the server to load it on subsequent 
# restarts.
#
# For this reason, CREATE_FUNCTION requires the INSERT priv for the mysql db.
#
# To remove a UDF, use the DROP_FUNCTION statement. For example:
#
# 		DROP FUNCTION metaphon;
#
# DROP_FUNCTION unloads the UDF and removes it from the mysql.func system table.
# For this reason, DROP_FUNCTION statements require the DELETE priv for the mysql db.
#
# With the UDF No longer registered in the table, the server does not load the UDF automatically for subsequent restarts.
#
# You cannot use CREATE_FUNCTION to reinstall a function that has previously been installed.
# To reinstall a function, first remove it with DROP_FUNCTION, then install it again with CREATE_FUNCTION.
#
# You would need to do this, for example, if you ugprade to  a new version of MySQL that provides an updated implementation
# of the function, so you recompile a new version of a function that you have written.
#
# Otherwise, the Server uses the old version.
#
# If the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option, it does not consult the mysql.func table and does not
# load the UDFs listed there.
#
# OBTAINING USER-DEFINED FUNCTION INFORMATION
#
# The Performance Schema user_defined_functions table contains information about the currently loaded user-defined functions:
#

#
# RUNNING MULTIPLE MYSQL INSTANCES ON ONE MACHINE
#
# In some cases, you might want to run multiple instances of MySQL on a single machine.
# You might want to test a new MySQL release while leaving an existing production setup undisturbed.
#
# Or you might want to give different users access to different mysqld servers that they manage themselves.
# (For example, you might be an ISP that wants to provide independent MySQL installations for different customers)
#
# IT is possible to use a different MySQL server binary per instance, or use the same binary for multiple instances,
# or any combination of the two approaches.
#
# For example, you might run a server of 5.7, and one of 8.0, etc.
#
# Whether or not you use distinct server binaries, each instance that you run must be configured with unique values for
# several operating params.
#
# This eliminates the potentional for conflict between instances.
#
# parameters can be set on the cmd line, in option files, or by setting environment variables.
#
# To see the values used by a given isntance, connect to it and execute a SHOW_VARIABLES statement.
#
# The primary resource managed by a MySQL instance is the data dir. Each instance should use a different
# data dir, the location of which is specified using the --datadir=<dir_name> option.
#
# For methods of configuring each instance with its own data dir, and warnings about the dangers of failing to do so,
# is covered soon.
#
# In addition to using different data directories, several other options must have different values for each server instance:
#
# 		) --port=<port_num>
#
# 			--port controls the port number for TCP/IP connections. Alternatively, if the host has multiple network addresses, you can use
# 			--bind-address to cause each server to listen to a different address.
#
# 		) --socket={<file_name> | <pipe name>}
#
# 			--socket controls the Unix socket file path on Unix or the named pipe name on Windows.
# 			On Windows, it is necessary to specify distinct pipe names only for those servers configured to permit named-pipe connections.
#
# 		) --shared-memory-base-name=<name>
#
# 			This option is used only on Windows. It designates the shared-memory name used by a Windows server to permit clients to connect
# 			using shared memory.
#
# 			It is necessary to specify distinct shared-memory names only for those servers configured to permit shared-memory connections.
#
# 		) --pid-file=<file_name>
#
# 			This option indicates the path name of the file in which the server writes its process ID.
#
# If you use the following log file options, their values must differ for each server:
#
# 		) --general_log_file=<file_name>
#
# 		) --log-bin[=<file_name>]
#
# 		) --slow_query_log_file=<file_name>
#
# 		) --log-error[=<file_name>]
#
# To achieve better performance, you can specify the following option differently for each server, to spread the load between
# several physical disks:
#
# 		) --tmpdir=<dir_name>
#
# Having different temporary directories also makes it easier to determine which MySQL server created any given temp file.
#
# If you have multiple MySQL installations in different locations, you can specify the base dir for each installation with
# the --basedir=<dir_name> option.
#
# This causes each instance to automatically use a different data dir, log files and PID file because the default for each
# of those params is relative to the base dir.
#
# In that case, the only other options you need to specify are the --socket and --port options.
#
# Suppose that you install different versions of MySQL using tar file binary distribs.
#
# These install in different locations, so you can start the server for each installation using the command bin/mysqld_safe under
# its corresponding base dir.
#
# mysqld_safe determines the proper --basedir option to pass to mysqld, and you need specify only the --socket and --port
# options to mysqld_safe.
#
# As discussed in the following sections, it is possible to start additional servers by specifying appropiate command options or
# by setting environment variables.
#
# However, if you need to run multiple servers on a more permanent basis, it is more convenient to use option files to
# specify for each server those option values that must be unique to it.
#
# The --defaults-file option is useful for this purpose.
#
# SETTING UP MULTIPLE DATA DIRS
#
# Each MySQL Instance on a machine should have its own data dir. 
#
# The location is specified using the --datadir=<dir_name> option.
#
# There are different methods of setting up a data dir for a new instance:
#
# 	) Create a new data dir
#
# 	) Copy an existing data dir
#
# WARNING:
#
# 		Normally, you should never have two servers that update data in the same DBs.
#
# 		This may lead to unpleasant suprises if your OS does not support faul-free system locking.
#
# 		If (despite warnings) you run multiple servers using the same data dir and they have logging
# 		enabled, you must use the appropiate options to specify log file names that are unique to each server.
#
# 		Otherwise, the servers try to log to the same files.
#
# 		Even when the preceding precautions are observed, this kind of setup works only with MyISAM and MERGE tables,
# 		and not with any of the other storage engines.
#
# 		Also, this warning against shared data dirs amongst servers always applies in an NFS environment.
# 		Permitting multiple MySQL servers to access a common data dir over NFS is <a terrible idea>
#
# 		The primary problem is that NFS is the speed bottleneck.
# 		It is not meant for such use. Another risk with NFS is that you must devise a way to ensure that
# 		two or more servers do not interfere with each other.
#
# 		Usually NFS file locking is handled by the lockd daemon, but at the moment there is no platform
# 		that performs locking 100% reliably in every situation.
#
# CREATE A NEW DATA DIR
#
# With this method, the data dir will be in the same state as when you first install MySQL.
# It will have the default set of MySQL accounts and no user data.
#
# On Unix, initialize the data dir.
#
# On Windows, the data dir is included in teh MySQL distrib:
#
# 	) MySQL Zip archive distribs for Windows contain an unmodified data dir. You can unpack such a distrib into a temp location, then
# 		copy the <data> dir to where you are setting up the new instance.
#
# 	) Windows MSI package installers createa nd set up the Data dir that the installed server will use, but also creates a pristine
# 		"template" data dir named <data> under the installation dir.
#
# 		After an installation has been performed using an MSA package, the template data dir can be copied to set up additional
# 		MySQL instances.
#
# COPY AN EXISTING DATA DIR
#
# With this method, any MySQL account or user data present in the data dir are carried over to the new data dir.
#
# 1. Stop the existing MySQL instance using the data dir. This must be a clean shutdown so that the instance flushes any pending changes to disk.
#
# 2. Copy the data dir to the location where the new data dir should be.
#
# 3. Copy the my.cnf or my.ini option file used by the existing instance. This serves as q basis for the new instance.
#
# 4. Modify the new option file so that any pathnames referring to the original data dir refer to the new data dir.
#
# 		Also, modify any other options that must be unique per instance, such as the TCP/IP port number and the log files.
#
# 5. Start teh new isntance, telling it to use the new option file.
#
# RUNNING MULTIPLE MySQL Instances on Windows
#
# You can run multiple servers on Windows by starting them manually from the cmd line, each with appropiate operating parameters,
# or by installing several servers as Windows services and running them that way.
#
# The following seciton pertains to how to start each server with different values for those options that must be unique
# per server, such as the data dir.
#
# STARTING MULTIPLE MySQL INSTANCES AT THE WINDOWS CMD LINE
#
# The procedure for starting a single MySQL server manually from the cmd line is refered to earlier.
#
# To start multiple servers this way, you can specify the appropiate options on the cmd line or in an option file.
# It is more convenient to place the options in an option file, but it is necessary to make sure that each server
# gets its own set of options.
#
# To do this, create an option file and tell the server the file name with a --defaults-file option when you run it.
#
# Suppose that you want to run one instance of mysqld on port 3307 with a data dir of C:\mydata1, and another instance on
# port 3308 with a data dir of C:\mydata2.
#
# Do as follows:
#
# 1. Make sure that each data dir exists, including its own copy of the mysql database that contains the grant tables.
#
# 2. Create two option files. For example, create one file named C:\my-opts1.cnf that looks as follows:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		datadir = C:/mydata1
# 		port = 3307
#
# Create a second file named C:\my-opts2.cnf that looks as:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		datadir = C:/mydata2
# 		port = 3308
#
# 3. Use the --defaults-file option to start each server with its own option file:
#
# 		C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
# 		C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --defaults-file=C:\my-opts2.cnf
#
# 	Each server starts in the foreground (no new prompt appears until the server exit later), so you will need to issue those
# 	two commands in separate console windows.
#
# To shut down the servers, connect to each using the appropiate port number:
#
# 		C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin --port=3307 --host=127.0.0.1 --user=root --password shutdown
# 		C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin --port=3308 --host=127.0.0.1 --user=root --password shutdown
#
# Servers configured as just described permit clients to connect over TCP/IP.
#
# If your version of Windows supports named pipes and you also want to permit named-pipe 
# connections, specify options that enable the named pipe and specify its name.
#
# Each server that supports named-pipe connections must use a unique pipe name.
# For example, the C:\my-opts1.cnf file might be written as:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		datadir = C:/mydata1
# 		port = 3307
# 		enable-named-pipe
# 		socket = mypipe1
#
# Modify C:\my-opts2.cnf similarly for use by the second server. Then start the servers as showcased before.
#
# A similar procedure applies for servers that you want to permit shared-memory connections.
#
# Enable such connections with the --shared-memory option and specify a unique shared-memory name
# for each server with the --shared-memory-base-name option.
#
# STARTING MULTIPLE MYSQL INSTANCES AS WINDOWS SERVICES
#
# On Windows, a MySQL server can run as a Windows Service. The procedures for installing, controlling and removing
# a single MySQL service is described earlier.
#
# To set up multiple MySQL services, you must make sure that each instance uses a different service name in addition
# to the other params that must be unique per instance.
#
# For the following instructions, suppose that you want to run the mysqld server from two different versions of MySQL
# that are installed at C:\mysql-5.5.9 and C:\mysql-8.0.15 respectively.
#
# To install MySQL as a Windows Service, use the --install or --install-manual option.
#
# Based on the preceding information, you have several ways to set up multiple services.
#
# The following instructions descrieb some, before any of them - shut down and remove any existing MySQL services.
#
# 		) 1 -> Specify the options for all services in one of the standard option files.
#
# 				To do this, use a different service name for each server. Suppose that you want to run the
# 				5.5.9 mysqld using the service name of mysqld and the 8.0.15 mysqld using the service name mysqld2.
#
# 				In this case, you can use the [mysqld1] group for 5.5.9 and [mysqld2] group for 8.0.15.
#
# 				FOr example, you can set up C:\my.cnf like:
#
# 					#options for mysqld1 service
# 					[mysqld1]
# 					basedir = C:/mysql-5.5.9
#  				port = 3307
# 					enable-named-pipe
# 					socket = mypipe1
#
# 					#options for mysqld2 service
# 					[mysqld2]
# 					basedir = C:/mysql-8.0.15
# 					port = 3308
# 					enable-named-pipe
# 					socket = mypipe2
#
#  			Install the services as follows, using the full server path names to ensure that Windows registers the correct .exe for each service:
#
# 					C:\mysql-5.5.9\bin\mysqld --install mysqld1
# 					C:\mysql-8.0.15\bin\mysqld --install mysqld2
#
# 				To start the services, use the services manager or use NET START with the appropiate service names:
#
# 					NET START mysqld1
# 					NET START mysqld2
#
# 				To stop the services, use the services manager or use the NET STOP with the appropiate service names:
#
# 					NET STOP mysqld1
# 					NET STOP mysqld2
#
# 		) 2 -> Specify options for each server in separate files and use --defaults-file when you install the services to tell
# 					each server what file to use.
#
# 				In this case, each file should list options using a [mysqld]group.
#
# 				With this approach, to specify options for the 5.5.9 mysqld, create a file C:\my-opts1.cnf that looks like:
#
# 					[mysqld]
# 					basedir = C:/mysql-5.5.9
# 					port = 3307
# 					enable-named-pipe
# 					socket = mypipe1
#
# 				For the 8.0.15 mysqld, create a file C:\my-opts2.cnf that looks like this:
#
# 					[mysqld]
# 					basedir = C:/mysql-8.0.15
# 					port = 3308
# 					enable-named-pipe
# 					socket = mypipe2
#
# 				Install the services as follows (each command on a single line):
#
# 					C:\mysql-5.5.9\bin\mysqld --install mysqld1 --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
# 					C:\mysql-8.0.15\bin\mysqld --install mysqld2 --defaults-file=C:\my-opts2.cnf
#
# 				When you install a MySQL server as a service and use a --defaults-file option, the service name must precede the option.
#
# 				After installing the services, start and stop them the same as before.
#
# To remove multiple services, use mysqld --remove for each one, specifying a service name following the --remove option.
# If the service name is the default (MySQL) you can omit it.
#
# RUNNING MULTIPLE MYSQL INSTANCES ON UNIX
#
# Note:
#
# 		The discussion here uses mysqld_safe to launch multiple instances of MySQL.
#
# 		For MySQL installation using an RPM distrib, server startup and shutdown is managed by systemd on several
# 		Linux platforms.
#
# 		On these platforms, mysqld_safe is not installed because it is unecessary.
#
# One way to run multiple MySQL instances on Unix is to compile different servers with different default TCP/IP 
# ports and Unix socket files so that each one listens on different network interfaces.
#
# Compiling in different base dirs for each installation also results automatically in a separate,
# compiled-in data dir, log file and PID file location for each server.
#
# Assuming that an existing 5.7 server is configured for the default TCP/IP port number (3306) and Unix socket file (/tmp/mysql.sock).
# To configure a new 8.0.15 server to have different operating Params, use a CMake akin to:
#
# 		cmake . -DMYSQL=port_number \
# 			 -DMYSQL_UNIX_ADDR=file_name \
# 			 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/mysql-8.0.15
#
# Here, <port_number> and <file_name> must be different from the default TCP/IP port number and Unix socket
# file path name, and the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value should specify an installation dir different from the one
# under which the existing MySQL installation is located.
#
# If you have a MySQL server listening on a given port number, you can use the following command to find out what 
# operating parameters it is using for several important configurable variables, including the base dir and Unix
# socket file name:
#
# 	mysqladmin --host=host_name --port=port_number variables
#
# With said info, you can conclude what options to NOT use when configuring a additional server.
#
# If you specify localhost as the host name, mysqladmin defaults to using a UNIX socket file connection
# rather than TCP/IP.
# 
# To explicitly specify the connection protocol, use the --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY} option.
#
# You need not compile a new MySQL server just to start with a different Unix socket file and TCP/IP port number.
# It is also possible to use the same server binary and start each invocation of it with different
# params of values at runtime.
#
# ONe way to do so is by using cmd line:
#
# mysqld_safe --socket=file_name --port=port_number
#
# To start a second server, provide different --socket and --port option values, and pass a --datadir=<dir_name> option to
# mysqld_safe so that the server uses a different data dir.
#
# Alternatively, put the options for each server in a different option file, then start each serer using a --defaults-file option
# that specifies the path to the appropiate rspective option file.
#
# For example, if the option files for two server instances are named /usr/local/mysql/my.cnf and /usr/local/mysql/my.cnf2, start the
# servers like:
#
# 		mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/my.cnf
# 		mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/my.cnf2
#
# Another way to achieve a similar effect is to use environment variables to set hte Unix socket file name and TCP/IP port number:
#
# 		MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/tmp/mysqld-new.sock
# 		MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3307
# 		export MYSQL_UNIX_PORT MYSQL_TCP_PORT
# 		bin/mysqld --initialize --user=mysql
# 		mysqld_safe --datadir=/path/to/datadir &
#
# This is a quick way of startin a second server to use for testing.
#
# The nice thing about this method is that the env variable settings apply to any client programs
# that you invoke from the same shell.
#
# Thus, connections for those clients are automatically directed to the second server.
#
# on Unix, the mysqld_multi script provides another way to start multiple servers.
#
# USING CLIENT PROGRAMS IN A MULTIPLE-SERVER ENVIRONMENT
#
# To connect with a client program to a MySQL server that is listening to different network interfaces from those
# compiled into your client, you can use one of the following methods:
#
# 		) Start the client with --host=<host_name> --port=<port_number> to connect using TCP/IP to a remote server,
# 			--host=127.0.0.1 --port=<port_number> for TCP/IP to local
# 			--host=localhost --socket=<file_name> to a local server using a Unix socket file or a Windows named pipe.
#
# 		) Start the client with --protocol=TCP to connect using TCP/IP, --protocol=SOCKET to connect using a UNIX
# 			socket file, --protocol=PIPE to connect using a named pipe or --protocol=MEMORY to connect using shared memory.
#
# 			For TCP/IP connections, you may also need to specify --host and --port options.
#
# 			For the other types of connections, you may need to specify a --socket option to specify a Unix socket file
# 			or Windows named pipe name, or a --shared-memory-base-name option to specify the shared-memory name.
#
# 			Shared memory is only on Windows.
#
# 		) On Unix, set the MySQL_UNIX_PORT and MYSQL_TCP_PORT env variables to point to the Unix socket file and TCP/IP
# 			port number before you start your clients.
#
# 			If you normally use a specific socket file or port number, you can place commands to set these ENV variables
# 			in your .login files so that they apply each time you log in.
#
# 		) Specify the default Unix socket file and TCP/IP port number in the [client] group of an option file.
#
# 			FOr example, you can use C:\my.cnf on Windows, or the .my.cnf file in your home dir on Unix.
#
# 		) In a C program, you can specify the socket file or port number arguments in the mysql_real_connect() call.
# 			You can also have the program read option files by calling mysql_options()
#
# 		) If you are using the Perl DBD::mysql module, you can read options from MySQL option files. For example:
#
# 			$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=client;"
# 						"mysql_read_default_file=/usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf";
# 			$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
#
# Other programming interfaces provide similar capabilities for reading option files.
#
# SECURITY
#
# When thinking about security within a MySQL installation, you should consider a wide range of possible topics and how they
# affect the security of your MySQL server and related apps:
#
# 		) General factors that affect security. These include choosing good PWs, not granting unecessary privs, ensuring application
# 			security by preventing SQL injections and data corruption, etc.
#
# 		) Security of the installation itself. The data files, log files and all the application files of your installation should be
# 			protected to ensure that they are not readable or writable by unauthorized parties.
#
# 		) Access control and security within the database system itself, including the users and database granted with access to the DBs,
# 			views and stored programs in use within the DB.
#
# 		) The features offered by security-related plugins.
#
# 		) Network security of MySQL and your system. The security is related to the grants for individual users, but you may also
# 			wish to restrict MySQL so that it is available only locally on the MySQL server host or a limited set of other hosts.
#
# 		) Ensure that you have adequate and appropiate backups of your DB files, configuration and log files.
# 			Also, be sure that you have a recovery solution in place and test that you are able to successfully
# 			recover the info from your backups.
#
# GENERAL SECURITY ISSUES
#
# Security Guidelines
#
# In discussing security, it is necessary to consider fully protecting the entire server host (not just the MySQL server) against all types
# of applicable attacks: eavesdropping, alerting, playback and denial of service.
#
# MySQL uses security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all connections, queries, and other operations that users can attempt to perform.
# There is also support for SSL-encrypted connections between MySQL clients and servers.
#
# WHen running MySQL, follow these guidelines:
#
# 		) Do not ever give anyone (except MySQL root accounts) access to the user table in the mysql system DB. Critical.
#
# 		) Keep an eye on privs. Use the GRANT and REVOKE statements to control access to MySQL. Do not grant more than necessary, never
# 			grant privs to all hosts.
#
# 				) Try mysql -u root. If you are able to connect successfully without being asked for a PW, anyone can connect to your MySQL
# 					as Root.
#
# 				) Use the SHOW_GRANTS statement to check which accounts have access to what. Then use the REVOKE statement to remove those privs that
# 					are not necessary.
#
# 		) Do not store cleartext PWs in your DB. If your computer becomes compromised, that's an issue.
#
# 			Use SHA2() or some other one-way hashing function and store the hash value.
#
# 		  To prevent PW recovery using rainbow tables, do not use these functions on a plain PW. Use something to be as as a salt,
# 			and go by the form of:
#
# 				hash(hash(password)+salt) 
#
# 		) Do not choose Pws from a Dictionary. Special programs exist to break PWs.
#
# 			Normal considerations of PW consolidation goes here.
#
# 		) Get a firewall. Put the MySQL behind a firewall or in a demilitarized zone (DMZ)
#
# 			) Try to scan your ports from the internet using a tool such as nmap.
#
# 				MySQL uses port 3306 by default.
#
# 				Should not be accessible by untrusted hosts. 
#
# 				Can be checked with: telnet <server_host> 3306 #Should refuse connection and give scrambles back.
#
# 		) Applications that access MySQL should not trust any data entered by users and should be written using proper defensive
# 			programming techniques.
#
# 		) Do not transmit unencrypted data over the Internet. 
#
# 			Use SSL or SSH. MySQL supports internal SSL connections. Another technique is to use SSH port-forwarding to
# 			create an encrypted (and compressed) tunnel for the communication.
#
# 		) learn to use the tcpdump and strings utilities. In most cases, you can check whether MySQL data streams are unencrypted by issuing
# 			a cmd like:
#
# 			tcpdump -l -i eth0 -w - src or dst port 3306 | strings
#
# 			Works under linux, should work under others with small modifications.
#
# 			Warning: If you do not see cleartext data, this does not mean that the info actually is encrypted. 
#
# 			If compression is in use on the connection (MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESS) you will not see plain text but the data is not encrypted.
#
# KEEPING PWS SECURE
#
# PWs occur in several contexts within MySQL.
#
# The following section pertains to guidelines that enable end users and admins to keep their PWs secure and avoid exposing them.
# In addition, the validate_password plugin can be used to enforce a policy on an acceptable PW.
#
# END-USER GUIDELINES FOR PW SECURITY
#
# When you run a client program to connect to the MySQL server, it is inadvisable to specify your PW in a way that exposes it
# to discovery by other users.
#
# The methods you can use to specify your PW when you run client programs are listed - along with an assesment of the risks
# of each method.
#
# In short, the safest methods are to have the client program prompt for the password or to specify the PW in a properly protected
# option file.
#
# 		) Use the mysql_config_editor utility, which enables you to store authentication credentials in an encrypted login path named
# 			.mylogin.cnf 
#
# 			The file can be read later by MySQL client programs to obtain authentication credentials for connecting to MySQL Server.
#
# 		) Use a -p<your_pw> or --password=<your_pass> option on the cmd line. For example:
#
# 			mysql -u francis -pfrank <db_name> #Do not write PWs on cmd prompt
#
# 			WARNING:
#
# 				This is insecure. On some systems, your PW becomes visible to System status programs such as ps that may be invoked by
# 				other users to display cmd lines.
#
# 				MySQL clients typically overwrite the cmd-line PW argument with 0's during their initialization sequence.
#
# 				However, there is a brief interval during which the value is visible.
#
# 				also, on some systems this overwritin strat is ineffective and the PW remains visible to ps. (SystemV Unix systems and perhas others are subject
# 				to this problem)
#
# 			If your operating environment is set up to display your current cmd in the title bar of your terminal window, the PW remains visible
# 			as long as the cmd is running, even if the cmd has scrolled out of view in the window content area.
#
# 		) Use the -p or --password option on the cmd line with no PW value specified. In this case, the client program solicits the PW interactively:
#
# 			mysql -u francis -p <db_name>
# 			Enter PW: 
#
# 			Use a options file instead.
#
# 			it is more secure to enter your PW like this than to specify it on the cmd line because it is not visible to other users.
# 			However, this method of entering a PW is suitable only for programs that you run interactively.
#
# 			If you want to invoke a client from a script that runs noninteractively, there is no opportunity to enter the PW
# 			from the keyboard.
#
# 			On some systems, you may even find that the first line of your script is read and interpreted (incorrectly) as your PW.
#
# 		) Store your PW in an option file. For example, on Unix, you can list your PW in the [client] section of the .my.cnf file in your home dir:
#
# 				[client]
#	 			password=your_pass
#
# 			To keep the PW safe, the file should not be accessible to anyone but yourself.
#
# 			To ensure this, set the file masking to 400 or 600, for example:
#
# 				chmod 600 .my.cnf
#
# 			To name from the cmd line a specific option file containing the PW, use the --defaults-file=<file_name> option,
# 			where file_name is the full path name to the file.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 				mysql --defaults-file=/home/francis/mysql-opts
#
# 		) Store your PW in the MYSQL_PWD env variable.
#
# 			This method of specifying your MySQL PW must be considered extremely insecure and dshould not be used.
#
# 			Some versions of pw include an option to display the ENV vars of the running process.
# 			On some systems, if you set MYSQL_PWD, your PW is exposed to any other user who runs ps.
#
# 			Even on systems without such a version of ps, it is unwise to assume that it's safe, as in, being non able to be inspected.
#
# On Unix, the mysql client writes a record of executed statements to a history file.
# By default, this file is named .mysql_history and is created in your home dir.
#
# PWs can be written as plain text in SQL statements such as CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER, so if you use these statements they are
# logged in the history file.
#
# TO keep this file safe, use a restrictive access mode, teh same way as described earlier for the .my.cnf file
#
# If your command interpreter is configured to maintain a history, any file in which the commands are saved will contain
# MySQL pws entered on the cmd line.
#
# For example, bash uses ~/.bash_history. Any such file should have a restrictive access mode.
#
# ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES FOR PW SECURITY
#
# Database administrators should use the following guidelines to keep PWs secure.
#
# MySQL stores PWs for user accounts in the mysql.user table. Access to this table should never be granted to any non-admins.
#
# Account PWs can be expired so that users must reset them.
#
# The validate_password plugin can be used to enforce a policy on acceptable PWs.
#
# A user who has access to modify the plugin dir (the value of the plugin_dir SYS_VAR) or the my.cnf file that specifies
# the plugin dir location can replace plugins and modify the capabilities provided by plugins, including authentication plugins.
#
# Files such as log files to which PWs might be written should be protected.
#
# PASSWORDS AND LOGGING
#
# Passwords can be written as plain text in SQL statements such as CREATE_USER, GRANT and SET_PASSWORD.
# If such statements are logged by the MySQL server as written, PWs in them become visible to anyone with access
# to the logs.
#
# Statement logging avoids writing Pws in cleartext for hte following statements:
#
# 		CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED BY ... 
# 		ALTER USER ... IDENTIFIED BY ...
# 		SET PASSWORD ...
# 		SLAVE START ... PASSWORD = ...
# 		CREATE SERVER ... OPTIONS(... PASSWORD ...)
# 		ALTER SERVER ... OPTIONS(... PASSWORD ...)
#
# Passwords in those statements are rewritten to not appear literally in statement text written to the general query log,
# slow log and binary log.
#
# Rewriting does not apply to other statements.
#
# In particular, INSERT or UPDATE statements for the mysql.user table that refer to literal PWs are logged as is,
# so you should avoid such statements. (Direct modification of grant tables is discouraged, anyway)
#
# For the general query log, password rewriting can be suppressed by starting the server with the --log-raw option.
# For security reasons, this option is not recommended for production use.
#
# For diagnostic purposes, it may be useful to see the exact text of statements as received by the server.
#
# By default, contents of audit log files produced by tthe audit log plugin are not encrypted and may contain
# sensitive information, such as the text of SQL statements.
#
# For security reasons, audit log files should be written to a directory accessible only to the MySQL server and to
# users with a legit reason to view the log.
#
# Statements received by the server may be rewritten if a query rewrite plugin is installed, in this case - the --log-raw
# option affects statements logging as follows:
#
# 		) without --log-raw, the server logs the statement returned by the query rewrite plugin. This may differ from the statement as received.
#
# 		) With --log-raw, the server logs the original statement as received.
#
# An implication of password rewriting is that statements that cannot be parsed (due, for example, to sytnax errors) are not written
# to the general query log because they cannot be known to be PW free.
#
# Use cases that require logging of all statements including those with errors should use the --log-raw option, bearing in mind that
# this also bypasses password rewriting.
#
# Password rewriting occurs only when plain text PWs are expected.
# For statements with syntax that expect a PW hash value, no rewriting occurs.
#
# if a plain text PW is supplied errorneously for such syntax, the pw is logged as given, without rewriting.
#
# To guard log files against unwarranted exposure, locate them in a directory that restricts access to the server
# and the database administrator.
#
# If the server logs to tables in the mysql database, grant access to those tables only to the DB admin.
#
# Replication salves store the PW for the replication master in the master info repostiory, which by default is a table
# in the mysql db named slave_master_info.
#
# The use of a file in the data dir for the master info repository is now deprecated.
# But still posible.
#
# Ensure that hte master info repository can be accseed only by the DB admin.
#
# An alternative to storing the PW in the master info repository is to use the START_SLAVE
# statement to specify credentials for connecting to the master.
#
# Use a restricted access mode to protect DB backups that include log tables or log files containing PWs.
#
# MAKING MYSQL SECURE AGAINST ATTACKERS
#
# When you connect to a MySQL server, you should use a PW. The PW is not transmitted in clear text over the connection.
#
# ALl other info is transferred as text, and can be read by anyone who is able to watch the connection.
#
# If the connection between the client and the server goes through an untrusted network, and you are
# concerned about this, you can use the compressed protocol to make traffic much more difficult to decipher.
#
# You can also use MySQL's internal SSL support to make the connection even more secure.
#
# Alternative, use SSH to get an encrypted TCP/IP conn between a MySQL server and a MySQL client.
#
# To make a MySQL system secure, you should strongly consider the following suggestions:
#
# 		) Require all MySQL accounts to have a PW. A client program does not necessarily know the identity of the person running it.
#
# 			It is common for client/server applications that the user can specify any user name to the client program.
#
# 			For example, anyone can use the mysql program to connect as any other person by simply invoking it as
# 			mysql -u <other_user> <db_name> if other_user has no PW.
#
# 			If all accounts have a PW, connecting using another user's acc becomes much more difficult.
#
# 		) Make sure that the onl Unix user acc with read or write privs in teh DB dirs is the acc used for running mysqld.
#
# 		) Never run the MySQL server as the Unix root user.
#
# 			This is dangerous,because any user with the FILE priv is able to cause the server to create files as root
# 			(For example ~root/.bashrc).
#
# 			To prevent this, mysqld refuses to run as root unless that is specified explicitly using the --user=root option.
#
# 			Mysqld can (and should) be run as an ordinary, unprived user instead.
#
# 			You can create a separate Unix acc named mysql to amek everything even more secure.
#
# 			Use this acc only for administrating MySQL.
#
# 			To start mysqld as a different Unix user, add a user option that specifies the user name in the 
# 			[mysqld] group of the my.cnf option file where you specify server options.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				user=mysql
#
# 			This causes hte server to start as the designated user whether oyu start it manually or by using mysqld_safe or mysql.server
#
# 			Running mysqld as Unix user other than root does not mean you need to  change the root user name in teh user table.
# 			User names for MySQL accs have nothing to do with user names for Unix accs.
#
# 		) Do not grant the FILE priv to nonadmin users. Any user that has this priv can write a file anywhere in the file system with the
# 			privs of teh mysqld daemon.
#
# 			this includes teh server's data dir containing the files that implement the priv tables.
#
# 			To make FILE priv ops a bit safer, files generated with SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE do not overwrite existing files and are writable
# 			by everyone.
#
# 			The FILE priv may also be used to read any file that is world-readable or accesible to the unix user
# 			that hte server runs as.
#
# 			With this priv, you can read any file into the DB tables. This could be abused, by using LOAD_DATA to load /etc/passwd into a table,
# 			which then can be displayed with SELECT.
#
# 			To limit the location in which files can be read and written, set the secure_file_priv System to a specific dir.
#
# 		) Do not grant the PROCESS or SUPER priv to nonadmins.
#
# 			The output of mysqladmin processlist and SHOW_PROCESSLIST shows the text of any stratements currently being
# 			executed, so any user who is permitted to see the server process list might be able to see statements
# 			issued by other users.
#
# 			mysqld reseves an extra connection for users who have the CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER Priv, so that a MySQL root
# 			can log in and check server activity even if all normal connections are in use.
#
# 			The SUPER priv can be used to terminate client connections, change server operation by changing the value of SYS_VARs,
# 			and control replication servers.
#
# 		) Do not permit the use of symlinks to tables. (This capability can be disabled with the --skip-symbolic-links option).
#
# 			This is especially important if you run mysqld as root, because anyone that has write access to the server
# 			data dir then could delete any file in teh system
#
# 		) Stored programs and views should be written using the security guidelines seen later
#
# 		) If you do not trust your DNS, you should use IP addresses rather than host names in teh grant tables.
#
# 			IN any case, you should be very careful about creating grant tables entires using host name values that
# 			contain wildcards.
#
# 		) If you want to restrict the number of connections permitted to a single account, you can do so by setting the max_user_connections
# 			variable in mysqld.
#
# 			The CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER statements also support resource control options for limiting the extent of server use
# 			permitted to an account.
#
# 		) If the plugin dir is writable by the server, it may be possible for a user to write executable code to a file in the 
# 			dir using SELECT_..._INTO_DUMPFILE
#
# 			This can be prevented by making plugin_dir read only to the server or by setting --secure-file-priv to a dir where SELECT
# 			writes can be made safely.

#
# HOW TO RUN MYSQL AS A NORMAL USER
#
# On Windows, you can run the server as a Windows service using a normal user acc.
#
# On Linux, for installations performed using a MySQL repository or RPM packages, teh MySQL
# server mysqld should be started by the local mysql OS user.
#
# Starting by another OS user is not supported by the init script that are included as part of the
# MySQL repos.
#
# On Unix (or Linux for installations performed using tar.gz packages), teh MySQL server mysqld can be
# started and run by any user.
#
# However, you should avoid running the server as the Unix root user for security reasons.
#
# To change mysqld to run as a normal unprived Unix user <user_name>, you must do:
#
# 		1. Stop the server if it is running (use mysqladmin shutdown)
#
# 		2. Change the DB dirs and files so that <user_name> has privs to read and write files in them
# 			(you might need to do this as the Unix root user):
#
# 				chown -R <user_name> /path/to/mysql/datadir
#
# 			If you do not do this, teh server will not be able to access DBs or tables when it runs as <user_name>
#
# 			If dirs or files within teh MySQL data dir are symbolic links, chown -R might not follow symbolic links for you.
# 			If it does not, you will also need to follow those links and change the dirs and files they point to.
#
# 		3. Start the server as user <user_name>. ANother alternative is to start mysqld as the Unix root user and use
# 			the --user=<user_name> option.
#
# 			mysqld starts up, then switches to run as the Unix user <user_name> before accepting any connections.
#
# 		4. To start the server as the given user automatically at system startup time, specify the user name by adding
# 			a user option to the [mysqld] group of the /etc/my.cnf option file or the my.cnf option file in the server's
# 			data dir.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				user=user_name
#
# If your Unix machine itself is not secured, you should assign PWs to the MySQL root account in the grant tables.
#
# Otherwise, any user with a login account on that machine can run the mysql client with a --user=root option
# and perform any operation.
#
# (It is a good idea to assign PWs to MySQL accs in any case, but especially so when other login accs exist
# on the server host)
#
# SECURITY ISSUES WITH LOAD DATA LOCAL
#
# The LOAD_DATA statement can load a file located on the server host, or if the LOCAL keyword is specified, on the client host.
#
# There are two potentional security issues with the LOCAL version of LOAD_DATA:
#
# 		) The transfer of the file from client host to the server host is initiated by the MySQL server. 
#
# 			In theory,a patched server could be built that would tell the client program to transfer a file of the server's
# 			choosing rather than the file named by the client in the LOAD_DATA statement.
#
# 			Such a server could access any file of the client host to which the user has read acces.
#
# 			(A patched server could in fact reply with a file-transfer request to any statement, not just LOAD_DATA_LOCAL,
# 			so a more fundamental issue is that clients should not connect to untrusted servers.)
#
# 		) In a Web environment where the clients are connecting from a Web server, a user could LOAD_DATA_LOCAL to read
# 			any files that the Web server process has read access to (assuming that a user could run any statement against
# 			the SQL server).
#
# 			In this environment, the client with respect to the MySQL server actually is the Web server, not a remote
# 			program being run by users who connect to the Web server.
#
# To avoid LOAD_DATA issues, clients should avoid using LOCAL.
#
# To avoid connecting to untrusted servers, clients can establish a secure connection and verify the server
# identity by connecting using the --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY option and the appropiate CA certificate.
#
# To enable admin and applications to manage the local data loading capability, LOCAL configuration works like this:
#
# 		) On teh server side:
#
# 			) The local_infile SYS_VAR controls server-side LOCAL capability.
# 				Depending on the local_infile setting, teh server refuses or permits local data loading by clients
# 				that have LOCAL enabled on the client side.
#
# 				By default, local_infile is disabled.
#
# 			) To explicitly cause the server to refuse or permit LOAD_DATA_LOCAL statements (regardless of how client programs
# 				and libraries are configured at build time or runtime), start mysqld with local_infile disabled or enabled,
# 				respectively.
#
# 				local_infile can also be set at runtime.
#
# 		) On the client side:
#
# 			) The ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE CMake option controls the compiled-in default LOCAL capability for the MySQL client lib.
# 				Cliens that make no explicit arrangements therefore have LOCAL capability disabled or enabled according to
# 				the ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE setting specified at MySQL build time.
#
# 				By default, the client lib in MySQL binary distribs is compiled with ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE disabled.
# 				If you compile MySQL from source, configure it with ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE disabled or enabled based on
# 				whether clients clients that make no explicit arrangements should have LOCAL capability disabled or enabled, resp..
#
# 			) Client programs that use the C API can control load data loading explicitly by invoking mysql_options() to disable or 
# 				enable the MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE option.
#
# 			) For the Mysql client, local data loading is disabled by default. To disable or enable it explicitly, use the
# 				--local-infile=0 or --local-infile[=1] option.
#
# 			) For the mysqlimport client, local data loading is disabled by default. To disable, or enable it explicitly,
# 				use the --local=0 or --local[=1] option.
#
# 			) If you use LOAD_DATA_LOCAL in Perl scripts or other programs that read the [client] group from option files,
# 				you can add an local-infile option setting to that group.
#
# 				To prevent problems for programs that do not understand this option, specify it using the loose- prefix:
#
# 					[client]
# 					loose-local-infile=0
# 			
# 				or:
#
# 					[client]
# 					loose-local-infile=1
#
# 			) In all cases, successful use of a LOCAL load by a client requires that hte server eprmits it.
#
# If LOCAL capability is disabled, on either server or clietn side, a client that attempts to issue a LOAD_DATA_LOCAL statement
# receives the following error message:
#
# 		ERROR 1148: The used command is not allowed with this MySQL verison
#
# CLIENT PROGRAMMING SECURITY GUIDELINES
#
# Applications that access MySQL should not trust any data entered by users, who can try to trick your code by entering special or escaped
# char sequences in Web forms, URLs or whathever app you have built.
#
# Be sure that your application remains secure if a user enters something like ; DROP DATABASE mysql;
# This is an extreme example, but large security leaks and data loss might occur as a result of hackers using similar techniques,
# if you do not prepare for them.
#
# A common mistake is to protect only string data values. 
#
# Rmember to check numeric data as well. If an application generates a query such as SELECT * FROM table WHERE
# ID=234 when a user enters the value 234, the user can enter the value 234 OR 1=1 to cause the aplication to generate the
# query SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234 OR 1=1
#
# as a result, the server retrieves every row in the table.
#
# This exposes every row, and causes excessive server load.
# The simplest way to protect from this type of attack is to use a single quotation mark
# around the numeric constants:
#
# SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID='234'
#
# If the user enters extra info, it all becomes part of the string.
#
# In a numeric context, MySQL automatically converts that string to a number and strip any trailining nonnumeric chars from it.
#
# Sometiems people think that if a DB contains only publicly available data, it need not be protected.
# This is wrong.
#
# Even if it is permissible to display any row in the DB, you should still protect against denial of service attacks
# (for example, those that are based on the technique in the preceding paragraph that cause the server to waste resources)
#
# otherwise, your server becomes unresponsive.
#
# Checklist:
#
# 		) Enable strict SQL mode to tell the server to be more restrictive of what data values it accepts.
#
# 		) Try to enter single and double quotation marks (' and ") in all of your Web forms. If you get any kind of MySQL error, investigate
# 			the problem.
#
# 		) Try to modify dynamic URLs by adding %22("),%23(#) and %27(') to them.
#
# 		) Try to modify data types in dynamic URLs from numeric to char types using the chars shown in the previous example.
# 			Your application should be safe against these and similar attacks.
#
# 		) Try to enter characters, spaces and special symbols rather than numbers in numeric fields.
#
# 			Your application should remove thhem before passing them to MySQL or else generate an error.
#
# 			Passing unchecked values to MySQL is very dangerous.
#
# 		) Check the size of data before passing it to MySQL.
#
#		) Have your application connect to the DB using a user name different from the one you use for the admin purposes.
# 			Do not give your application any access privs they do not need.
#
# Many application programming interfaces provide a means of escaping special characters in data values.
#
# Properly used, this prevents application users from entering values that cause teh application to
# generate statements that have different effect than you intended:
#
# 		) MySQL C API: Use the mysql_real_escape_string_quote() API call
#
# 		) MySQL++: Use the escape and quote modeifiers for query streams
#
# 		) PHP: use either the mysqli or pdo_mysql extensions, and not hte older ext/mysql extension.
# 				The preferred APIs support the improved MySQL authentication protocol and PWs, as well as 
# 				prepared statements with placeholders.
#
# 				If the older ext/mysql extension must be used, then for escaping use the mysql_real_escape_string_quote()
# 				function and not mysql_escape_string() or addslashes() because only mysql_real_escape_string_quote() is
# 				character set-aware: the other functions can be "bypassed" when using (invalid) multibyte char sets.
#
# 		) Perl DBI: Use placeholders or the quote() method
#
# 		) Ruby DBI: Use placeholders or teh quote() method
#
# 		) Java JDBC: Use a PreparedStatement object and placeholders.
#
# etc.
#
# THE MYSQL ACCESS PRIVILEGE SYSTEM:
#
# The primary function of the MySQL privlege system is to authenticate a user who connects from a given host and to associate
# that user with privs on a database such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
#
# Additionally, functionality includes the ability to have anonymous users and to grant privs for MySQL-specific functions
# such as LOAD_DATA_INFILE and administrative operations.
#
# There are some things that you cannot do with the MySQL privilege system:
#
# 		) You cannot explicitly specify that a given user should be denied access.
# 			That is, you cannot explicity match a user and then refuse the connection.
#
# 		) You cannot specify that a user has privileges to create or drop tables in a database but not to create or drop the DB itself.
#
# 		) A PW applies globally to an account. You cannot associate a Pw with a specific object such as a database, table or routine.
#
# The user interface to the MySQL priv system consists of SQL statements such as CREATE_USER, GRANT and REVOKE.
#
# Internally, the server stores privs information in the grant tables of the mysql system database (that is, in the database named mysql).
# The MySQL server reads teh content of these tables into memory when it starts and base access-control decisions on the in-memory copies
# of the grant tables.
#
# The MySQL priv system ensures that all users may perform only the operations permitted to them.
# As a user, when you connect to a MySQL server, your identity is determined by the host from which you connect and
# the user name you specify.
#
# When you issue requests after connecting, the system grants privileges according to your identity and what you want to do.
#
# MySQL Considers both your host name and user name in idetifying you because there is no reason to assume that a given
# user name belongs to the same person on all hosts.
#
# For example, the user Joe who connects from office.example.com need not be the same per as joe who connects from home.example.com
#
# Mysql handles this by enabling you to distinguish users on different hosts that happen to have the same name:
#
# 		you can grant one set of privs for connections by joe from office.example.com and a different
# 		set of privs for connections by joe from home.example.com
#
# 		To see what privs a given account has, use the SHOW_GRANTS statement, for example:
#
# 				SHOW GRANTS FOR 'joe'@'office.example.com';
# 				SHOW GRANTS FOR 'joe'@'home.example.com'; 			
# 
# MySQL access control involves two stages when you run a client program that connect to the server:
#
# 		Stage 1: The server accepts or rejects the connection based on your identity and whether you can verify your
# 					identity by supplying the correct PW.
#
# 		Stage 2: Assuming that you can connect, the server checks each statement you issue to determine whether you ahve sufficient
# 					privs to eprform it.
#
# 					For example, if you try to select rows from a table in a DB or dopr a table from the DB, the server verifies that
# 					you ahve the SELECT privs for the table or the DROP priv for the database.
#
# 					For a more detailed walkthrough of each stage, covered later.
#
# 					If your privleges are changed (either by yourself or someone else), while you are connected, those changes
# 					do not necesasrily take effect immediately for the next statement that you issue.
#
# PRIVILEGES PROVIDED BY MYSQL
#
# THe privileges granted to a MySQL account determine which operations the account can perform.
#
# MySQL privileges differ in the contexts in which they apply and at different levels of operation:
#
# 		) Administrative privs enable users to manage operation of the MySQL server. These privs are global because they
# 			are not specific to a particular DB.
#
# 		) Database Privs apply to a DB and to all objects within it. These privs can be granted for specific DBs, or globally so
# 			that they apply to all dbs.
#
# 		) Privs for db objects such as tables, indexes, views and stored routines can be granted for specific objects within a
# 			database, for all objects of a given type within a database (for example, all tables in a database) or globally
# 			for all objects of a given type in all DBs.
#
# Privileges also differ in terms of whether they are static (built in to the server) or dynamic (defined at runtime).
# Whether a priv is static or dynamic affects its availability to be granted to user accounts and roles.
#
# Information about account privs is stored in the grant tables in the mysql SYSTEM_DB.
# Covered more later.
#
# The MYSQL server reads teh contents of the grant tables into memory when it starts, and reloads
# them under the circumstances indicated later.
#
# The server bases access-control decisions on the in-memory copies of the grant tables.
#
# Important:
#
# 		Some MySQL releases introduce changes to the grant tables to add new privs or features.
# 		To make sure that you can take advantage of any new capabilities, update your grant
# 		tables to the current structure whenever you upgrade MySQL.

#
# STATIC PRIVILEGE DESCRIPTIONS
#
# Static privs are built in to the server, in contrast to dynamic privs, which are defined at runtime.
# The following list describes each static priv available in MySQL.
#
# particular SQL statements might have more specific priv requirements than indicated here.
# If so, the description for the statement in question provides the details.
#
# 		) ALL, ALL_PRIVILEGES
#
# 				These privilege specifiers are shorthand for "all privileges available at a given privilege leve"
# 				(except GRANT_OPTION).
#
# 				For example, granting ALL at the global or table level grants all global privs or all table-level privs, respectively.
#
# 		) ALTER
#
# 				Enables use of the ALTER_TABLE statement to change the structure of tables.
#
# 				ALTER_TABLE also requires the CREATE and INSERT privileges.
# 				Renaming a table requires ALTER and DROP on the old table, CREATE and INSERT on the new table.
#
# 		) ALTER_ROUTINE
#
# 				Enables use of statements that alter or drop stored routines (stored procedures and functions)
#
# 		) CREATE
#
# 				Enables use of statements that create new databases and tables
#
# 		) CREATE_ROLE
#
# 				Enables use of the CREATE_ROLE statement. (The CREATE_USER priv also enables use of the CREATE_ROLE statement)
#
# 		) CREATE_ROUTINE
#
# 				Enables use of statements that create stored routines (stored procedures and functions)
#
# 		) CREATE_TABLESPACE
#
# 				Enables use of statements that create, alter or drop tablespaces and log file groups.
#
# 		) CREATE_TEMPORARY_TABLES
#
# 				Enables the creation of temporary tables using the CREATE_TEMPORARY_TABLE statement.
#
# 				After a session has created a temporary table, the server performs no further privilege checks on the table.
#
# 				The creating session can perform any operation on the table, such as DROP_TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE or SELECT.
#
# 		) CREATE_USER
#
# 				Enables use of the ALTER_USER, CREATE_ROLE, CREATE_USER, DROP_ROLE, DROP_USER, RENAME_USER and REVOKE_ALL_PRIVILEGES statements.
#
# 		) CREATE_VIEW
#
# 				Enables use of the CREATE_VIEW statement.
#
# 		) DELETE
#
# 				Enables rows to be deleted from tables in a database.
#
# 		) DROP
#
# 				Enables use of statements that drop (remove) existing databases, tables and views.
#
# 				The DROP privilege is required to use the ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION statement
# 				on a partitioned table.
#
# 				The DROP privilege is also required for TRUNCATE_TABLE
#
# 		) DROP_ROLE
#
# 				Enables use of the DROP_ROLE statement. (The CREATE_USER priv also enables use of the DROP_ROLE statement)
#
# 		) EVENT
#
# 				Enables use of statements that create, alter, drop or display events for the Event Scheduler.
#
# 		) EXECUTE
#
# 				Enables use of statements that execute stored routines (stored procedures and functions)
#
# 		) FILE
#
# 				Affects the following operations and server behaviors:
#
# 					) Enables reading and writing files on the server host using the LOAD_DATA_INFILE and SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE 
# 						statements and the LOAD_FILE() function.
#
# 						A user who has the FILE privilege can read any file on the server host that is either world-readable
# 						or readable by the MySQL server.
#
# 						(This implies that the user can read any file in any DB dir, because the server can access any of those files)
#
# 					) Enables creating new files in any directory where the MySQL server has write access.
# 						This includes the server's data dir containing the files that implement the privilege tables.
#
# 					) Enables use of the DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY table option for the CREATE_TABLE statement.
#
# 				As a security measure, the server does not overwrite existing files.
#
# 				To limit the location in which files can be read and written, set the secure_file_priv SYS_VAR to a specific dir.
#
# 		) GRANT_OPTION
#
# 				Enables you to grant to or revoke from other users those privileges that you yourself possess.
#
# 		) INDEX
#
# 				Enables use of statements that create or drop (remove) indexes. INDEX applies to existing tables.
#
# 				If you have the CREATE privilege for a table, you can include Index definitions in the CREATE_TABLE statement.
#
# 		) INSERT
#
# 				Enables rows to be inserted into tables in a database. INSERT is also required for the ANALYZE_TABLE, OPTIMIZE_TABLE,
# 				and REPAIR_TABLE table-maintenance statements.
#
# 		) LOCK_TABLES
#
# 				Enables use of explicit LOCK_TABLES statements to lock tables for which you have the SELECT privilege.
#
# 				This includes use of write locks, which prevents other sessions from reading the locked table.
#
# 		) PROCESS
#
# 				Enables display of information about the threads executing within the server (that is, information about the
# 				statements being executed by sessions).
#
# 				The privilege enables use of SHOW_PROCESSLIST or mysqladmin processlist to see threads belonging to other accounts;
# 				you can always see your own threads.
#
# 				The PROCESS privilege also enables use of SHOW_ENGINE.
#
# 		) PROXY
#
# 				Enables one user to impersonate or become known as another user.
#
# 		) REFERENCES
#
# 				Creation of foreign key constraint requires the REFERENCES privilege for the parent table.
#
# 		) RELOAD
#
# 				Enables use of the FLUSH statement. 
# 				It also enables mysqladmin commands that are equivalent to FLUSH operations:
#
# 				flush-hosts, flush-logs, flush-privileges, flush-status, flush-tables, flush-threads, refresh and reload.
#
# 				The reload command tells the server to reload the grant tables into memory.
#
# 				flush-privileges is a synonym for real. The refresh command closes and reopens the log files and flushes all
# 				tables.
#
# 				The other flush-xxx commands perform functions similar to refresh, but are more specific and may be preferable
# 				in some instances.
#
# 				For example, if you want to flush just the log files, flush-logs is a better choice than refresh.
#
# 		) REPLICATION_CLIENT
#
# 				Enables use of the SHOW_MASTER_STATUS, SHOW_SLAVE_STATUS and SHOW_BINARY_LOGS statements.
#
# 				Grant this privilege to accounts that are used by slave servers to connect to the current server
# 				as their master.
#
# 		) REPLICATION_SLAVE
#
# 				Enables the account to request updates that have been made to databases on the master server.
#
# 				Grants this privilege to accounts that are used by slave servers to connect to the current server as their master.
#
# 		) SELECT
#
# 				Enables rows to be selected from tables in a database. SELECT statements require the SELECT privilege only if
# 				they actually access tables.
#
# 				Some SELECT statements do not access tables and can be executed without permission for any database.
#
# 				For example, you can use SELECT as a simple calculator to evaluate expresisons that make no reference to tables:
#
# 					SELECT 1+1;
# 					SELECT PI()*2;
#
# 				The SELECT privilege is also needed for other statements that read column values.
#
# 				For example, SELECT is needed for columns referenced on the right hand side of <col_name>=<expr> assignment
# 				in UPDATE statements or for columns named in the WHERE clause of DELETE or UPDATE statements.
#
# 				The SELECT privilege is needed for tables or views used with EXPLAIN, including any underlying
# 				tables in view definitions.
#
# 		) SHOW_DATABASES
#
# 				Enables the account to see database names by issuing the SHOW DATABASE statement.
#
# 				Accounts that do not have this privlege see only databases for which they have some privs, and cannot use
# 				the statement at all if hte server was started with the --skip-show-database option.
#
# 				(Any global priv is considered a priv for all database)
#
# 		) SHOW_VIEW
#
# 				Enables use of the SHOW_CREATE_VIEW satement. This priv is also needed for views used with EXPLAIN.
#
# 		) SHUTDOWN
#
# 				Enables use of the SHUTDOWN and RESTART statements, the mysqladmin shutdown command and the mysql_shutdown() C API function.
#
# 		) SUPER
#
# 				SUPER is a powerful qnd far-reaching privilege and should not be granted lightly.
#
# 				If an account needs to perform only a subset of SUPER operations, it may be possible to achieve the desired
# 				privlege set by instead granting one or more dynamic privs, each of which confers more limited capacities.
#
# 				NOTE: SUPER is deprecated.
#
# 				SUPER affects the following operations and server behaviors:
#
# 					) Enables system variable changes at runtime:
#
# 							) Enables server configuration changes to global system variables with SET_GLOBAL and SET_PERSIST.
#
# 								The corresponding dynamic priv is SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN
#
# 							) Enables setting restricted session system variables that require a special privilege.
#
# 								The corresponding dynamic priv is SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN
#
# 					) Enables changes to global transaction characteristics
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic priv is SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN
#
# 					) Enables the account to start and stop replication, including Group replication.
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic privlege is REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN for regular replication, GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN for Group Replication.
#
# 					) Enables use of the CHANGE_MASTER_TO and CHANGE_REPLICATION_FILTER statements.
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic privlege is REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN.
#
# 					) Enables binary log control by means of the PURGE_BINARY_LOGS and BINLOG statements.
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic priv is BINLOG_ADMIN.
#
# 					) Enables setting the effective authorization ID when executing a view or stored program.
#
# 						A user with this privlege can specify any account in the DEFINER attribute of a view or stored program.
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic privilege is SET_USER_ID.
#
# 					) Enables use of the CREATE_SERVER, ALTER_SERVER and DROP_SERVER statements.
#
# 					) Enables use of the mysqladmin debug command.
#
# 					) Enables InnoDB encryption key rotation.
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic privilege is ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN
#
# 					) Enables execution of Version Tokens user-defined functions.
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic priv is VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN.
#
# 					) Enables nonempty <graphml> element content in the result from the ROLES_GRAPHML() function.
#
# 						The corresponding dynamic priv is ROLE_ADMIN
#
# 					) Enables control over client connections not permitted to non-SUPER accounts:
#
# 						) Enables use of the KILL statement or mysqladmin kill command to kill threads belonging to other accounts.
# 							(An account can always kill its own threads)
#
# 						) The server does not execute init_connect SYS_VARs content when SUPER client connects.
#
# 						) The server accepts one connection from SUPER client even if the connection limit configured by the max_connections SYS_VAR is reached.
#
# 						) A server in offline mode (offline_mode enabled) does not terminate SUPER client connections at the next client request,
# 							and accepts new connections from SUPER clients.
#
# 						) Updates can be performed even when the read_only SYS_VAR is enabled. This applies to explicit table updates, and to use of account-management
# 							statements such as GRANT and REVOKE that update tables implicitly.
#
# 					The corresponding dynamic priv for the preceding connection-control operations is CONNECTION_ADMIN.
#
# 				The may also need the SUPER priv to create or alter stored functions if binary logging is enabled.
#
# 		) TRIGGER
#
# 			Enables trigger operations. You must have this privilege for a table to create, drop, execute or display triggers for that table.
#
# 			When a trigger is activated (by a user who has privs to execute INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements for the table associated with the
# 			trigger), trigger execution requires that the user who defined the trigger still have the TRIGGER priv for the table.
#
# 		) UPDATE
#
# 			Enables rows to be updated in tables in a DB.
#
# 		) USAGE
#
# 			This privlege specifier stands for "no privs". It is used at the global level with GRANT to specify clauses such as WITH GRANT OPTION without
# 			naming specific account privs in the priv list.
#
# 			SHOW_GRANTS displays USAGE to indicate that an account has no privileges at a priv level.
#
# DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE DESCRIPTIONS
#
# Dynamic privileges are defined at runtime, in contrast to static privileges, which are built in to the server.
# The following list describes each dynamic privilege available in MySQL.
#
# Most dynamic privileges are defined at server startup. Others are defined by a particular server component or plugin,
# as indicated in the privilege descriptions.
#
# In such cases, the privilege is unavailable unless the component or plugin that defines it is enabled.
#
# Particular SQL statements might have more specific privilege requirements than indicated here.
# If so, the description for the statement in question provides the details.
#
# 		) AUDIT_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables audit log configuration. This privilege is defined by the audit_log plugin.
#
# 		) BACKUP_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables execution of the LOCK_INSTANCE_FOR_BACKUP statement and access to the Performance Schema Log_status table.
#
# 			The BACKUP_ADMIN privilege is automatically granted to users with the RELOAD privilege when performing an in-place
# 			upgrade to MySQL 8.0 from an earlier version.
#
# 		) BINLOG_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables binary log control by means of the PURGE_BINARY_LOGS and BINLOG statements.
#
# 		) CONNECTION_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables use of the KILL statement or mysqladmin kill command to kill threads belonging to other accounts.
# 			(An account can always kill its own threads).
#
# 			Enables setting SYS_VAR related to client connections, or circumventing restrictions related to client connections.
# 			CONNECTION_ADMIN applies to the effects of these SYS_VARs:
#
# 				) Init_connect: The server does not execute init_connect SYS_VAR content when CONNECTION_ADMIN clients connect.
#
# 				) max_connections: The server accepts one connection from a CONNECTION_ADMIN client even if the connection limit 
# 											configured by the max_connections SYS_VAR is reached.
#
# 				) offline_mode: A server in offline mode (offline mode enabled) does not terminate CONNECTION_ADMIN client connections
# 										at the next client request, and accepts new connections from CONNECTION_ADMIN clients.
#
# 				) read_only: Updates can be performed even when the read_only SYS_VAR is enabled.
#
# 									This applies to explicit table updates, and to use of account-management statements such as GRANT and REVOKE
# 									that update tables implicitly.
#
# 		) ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables InnoDB encryption key rotation.
#
# 		) FIREWALL_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables a user to administer firewall rules for any user.
# 			This privilege is defined by the MYSQL_FIREWALL plugin.
#
# 		) FIREWALL_USER
#
# 			Enables users to update their own firewall rules.
# 			This privilege is defined by the MYSQL_FIREWALL plugin.
#
# 		) GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables the account to start and stop GROUP REPLICATION. Grant this privilege to accounts that are used by slave servers to connect to the current server as their master.
#
# 		) PERSIST_RO_VARIABLES_ADMIN
#
# 			For users who also have SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, PERSIST_RO_VARIABLES_ADMIN enables use of SET_PERSIST_ONLY to persist global system variables
# 			to the mysqld-auto.cnf option file in the data dir.
#
# 			This statement is similar to SET_PERSIST but does not modify the runtime global SYS_VAR rule.
#
# 			This makes SET_PERSIST_ONLY suitable for configuring read-only SYS_VARS that can be set only at server startup.
#
# 		) REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables the account to connect to the master server, start and stop replication, and use the CHANGE_MASTER_TO and
# 			CHANGE_REPLICATION_FILTER statements.
#
# 			Grant this priv to accounts that are used by slave servers to connect to the current server as their master.
#
# 			This priv does not apply to Group Replication; use GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN for that.
#
# 		) RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables resource group management: Creating, Altering, and dropping resource groups; and assignment of threads and statements
# 			to resource groups.
#
# 			A user with this privilege can perform any operation relating to resource groups.
#
# 		) RESOURCE_GROUP_USER
#
# 			Enables assigning threads and statements to resource groups. A user with this priv can use the SET_RESOURCE_GROUP statement 
# 			and the RESOURCE_GROUP optimizer hint.
#
# 		) ROLE_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables use of the WITH ADMIN OPTION clause of the GRANT statement.
#
# 			Enables nonempty <graphml> element content in the result from the ROLES_GRAPHML() function.
#
# 		) SERVICE_CONNECTION_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables connections to the network interface that permits only administrative connections.
#
# 		) SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN
#
# 			For most SYS_VARs, setting the session value requires no special privileges and can be done by any user to affect
# 			the current session.
#
# 			For some system variables, setting the session value can have effects outside the current session and thus is a restricted
# 			operation.
#
# 			For these, the SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN privilege enables the user to set the session value.
#
# 			If a system variable is restricted and requires a special privilege to set the session value, the variable desc. indicates that
# 			restriction.
#
# 			Examples include - binlog_format, sql_log_bin and sql_log_off.
#
# 			SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN was added in MySQL 8.0.14.
#
# 			Prior to this, restricted session SYSTEM_VARIABLES can be set only by users who have the
# 			SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER priv.
#
# 			The SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN priv is a subset of the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and SUPER privs.
#
# 			A user who has either of those privs is also permitted to set restricted session variables and
# 			effectively has SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN by implication and need not be granted SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN explicitly. 			
#
# 		) SET_USER_ID
#
# 			Enables setting the effective authorization ID when executing a view or stored program.
#
# 			A user with this priv can specify any account in the DEFINER attribute of a view or stored program.
#
# 		) SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN
#
# 			Affects the following operations and server behaviors:
#
# 				) Enables system variable changes at runtime:
#
# 					) Enables server configuration changes to global system variables with SET_GLOBAL and SET_PERSIST.
#
# 					) Enables server configuration changes to global system variables with SET_PERSIST_ONLY, if the user also has PERSIST_RO_VARIABLES_ADMIN.
#
# 					) Enables setting restricted session system variables that require a special privilege.
# 						In effect, SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN implies SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN without explicitly granting SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN.
#
# 				) Enables changes to global transaction characteristics.
#
# 		) VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables execution of Version Tokens user-defined functions. This privilege is defined by the version_tokens plugin.
#
# 		) XA_RECOVER_ADMIN
#
# 			Enables execution of the XA_RECOVER statement.
#
# 			Prior to MySQL 8.0, any user could execute the XA_RECOVER statement to discover the XID values for oustanding prepared XA transactions,
# 			possibly leading to commit or rollback of an XA transaction by a user other than the one who started it.
#
# 			In MySQL 8.0, XA_RECOVER is permitted only to users who have the XA_RECOVER_ADMIN privilege, which is expected to be granted
# 			only to administrative users who have need for it.
#
# 			This might be case, for example, for administrators of an XA application if it has crashed and it is necessary to find outstanding
# 			transactions started by the application so they can be rolled back.
#
# 			This privilege requirement prevents users from discovering the XID values for oustanding prepared XA transactions other than their own.
# 			It does not affect normal commit or rollback of an XA transaction because the user who started it knows its XID.
#
# PRIVILEGE-GRANTING GUIDELINES
#
# It is a good idea to grant to an account only those privileges that it needs.
# You should exercise particular caution in granting the FILE and administrative privileges:
#
# 		) FILE can be abused to read into a database table any files that hte MySQL server can read on the server host.
# 			This includes all world-readable files and files in the server's data directory.
#
# 			The table can then be accessed using SELECT to transfer its contents to the client host.
#
# 		) GRANT_OPTION enables users to give their privileges to other users. Two users that have different privileges and with the GRANT_OPTION privilege
# 			are able to combine privileges.
#
# 		) ALTER may be used to subvert the privilege system by renaming tables.
#
# 		) SHUTDOWN can be abused to deny service to other users entirely by terminating the server.
#
# 		) PROCESS can be used to view the plain text of currently executing statements, including statements that set or change PWs.
#
# 		) SUPER can be used to terminate other sessions or change how the server operates.
#
# 		) Privileges granted for the mysql system databse itself can eb used to change Passwords and otehr access privilege information:
#
# 			) Passwords are stored encrypted, so a malicious user cannot simply read them to know the plain text password.
#
# 				However, a user with write access to the mysql.user table authentication_string column can change an account password,
# 				and the connect to the MySQL server using that account.
#
# 			) INSERT or UPDATE granted for the mysql system database enable a user to add privileges or modify existing privileges, respectively.
#
# 			) DROP for the mysql system database enables a user to remote privilege tables, or even the database itself.
#
# An example of creating a concatenated table of different privileges and system variables in terms of privileges:
#
# SELECT password, host, user,
# CONCAT(Select_priv, Lock_tables_priv) AS selock,
# CONCAT(Insert_priv, Update_priv, Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv) AS modif,
# CONCAT(Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv, Alter_priv) AS meta,
# CONCAT(Create_tmp_table_priv, Create_view_priv, Show_view_priv) AS views, #Some of these names might be off in terms of updated privilege sectionings
# etc...
# FROM USER ORDER BY user, host;
#
# STATIC VERSUS DYNAMIC PRIVILEGES
#
# MySQL supports static and dynamic privileges:
#
# 		) Static privs are built into the server. They are always available to be granted to user accounts and cannot be unregistered.
# 
# 		) Dynamic privs can be registered and unregistered at runtime. This affects their availability: A dynamic priv that has not been registered cannot be granted.
#
# For example, the SELECT and INSERT privileges are static and always available, whereas a dynamic privilege becomes available
# only if the server component that implements it has been enabled.
#
# The remainder of this section describes how dynamic privs work in MySQL. The discussion uses the term "components" but it applies equally to plugins.
#
# 		NOTE: 
#
# 			Server admins should be aware of which server components define dynamic privs.
# 			For MySQL distribs, documentation of components that define dynamic privs describe those privs.
#
# 			Third-party components may also define dynamic privs; an admin should understand those privs and not install
# 			components that might conflict or compromise server operations.
#
# 			For example, one component conflicts with another if both define a priv with the same name.
# 			Component devs can reduce the likelihood of this occurence by choosing priv names having a prefix based on the component name.
#
# The server maintains the set of registered dynamic privs internally in memory. Unregistration occurs at server shutdown.
#
# Normally, a server component that defines dynamic privs registers them when it is installed, during its initialization sequence.
# When uninstalled, a server component does not unregister its registered dynamic privs.
#
# (This is current practice, not a requirement. That is, components could - but do not - unregister at any time privs they register)
#
# No warning or error occurs for attempts to register an already registered dynamic priv.
# Consider the following sequence of statements:
#
# 		INSTALL COMPONENT 'my_component';
# 		UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'my_component';
# 		INSTALL COMPONENT 'my_component';
#
# The first INSTALL_COMPONENT registers any privs defined by the server component my_component.
#
# But the UNINSTALL COMPONENT does not unregister them.
#
# For the second INSTALL_COMPONENT statement, the component privs it registers are found to be
# already registered, but no warnings or errors occur.
#
# Dynamic privs apply only at the global level.
#
# The server stores information about current assignments of dynamic privs to user accounts in the
# mysql.global_grants system table:
#
# 		) The server automatically registers privs named in global_grants during server startup (unless the --skip-grant-tables option is given)
#
# 		) The GRANT and REVOKE statements modify the contents of global_grants
#
# 		) Dynamic privs assignments listed in global_grants are persistent. They are not removed at server shutdown.
#
# Example : The following statement grants to user u1 the privileges required to control replication (including Group Replication) on a slave server,
# and to modify system variables:
#
# 		GRANT REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN, GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN, BINLOG_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'u1'@'localhost';
#
# Granted dynamic privs appear in the output from the SHOW GRANTS statement and the INFORMATION_SCHEMA USER_PRIVILEGES table.
#
# For GRANT and REVOKE at the global level, any named privileges not recognized as static are checked against the current
# set of registered dynamic privs and granted if found.
#
# Otheriwse, an error occurs to indicate an unknown privilege identifier.
#
# For GRANT and REVOKE the meaning of ALL [PRIVS] at the global level includes all static global privs, as well as all currently
# registered dynamic privs:
#
# 		) GRANT ALL at the global level grants all static global privs and all currently registered dynamic privs.
# 			A dynamic priv registered subsequent to execution of the GRANT statement is not granted retroactively to any account.
#
# 		) REVOKE ALL at the global level revokes all granted static global privs and all granted dynamic privs.
#
# The FLUSH_PRIVILEGES statement reads the global_grants table for dynamic priv assignment and registers any unregistered privs found there.
#
# MIGRATING ACCOUNTS FROM SUPER TO DYNAMIC PRIVS
#
# In MySQL 8.0, many operations that previously required the SUPER priv are also associated with a dynamic priv of more limited scope.
#
# Each such operation can be permitted to an account by granting the associated dynamic priv rather than SUPER.
#
# This change improves security by enabling DBAs to avoid granting SUPER and tailor user privs more closely to the operations
# permitted.
#
# SUPER is deprecated, will be removed.
#
# When removal of SUPER occurs, operations that formerly required SUPER will fail unless accounts granted SUPER are migrated
# to the appropriate dynamic privs.
#
# Use the following instructions to accomplish that goal so that accounts are ready prior to SUPER removal:
#
# 		1. Execute this query to identify accounts that are granted SUPER:
#
# 				SELECT GRANTEE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_PRIVILEGES WHERE PRIVILEGE_TYPE = 'SUPER';
#
# 		2. For each account identified by the preceding query, determine the operations for which it needs SUPER.
#
# 			Then grant the dynamic privs corresponding to those operations, and revoke SUPER.
#
# 			For example, if 'u1'@'localhost' requires SUPER for binary log purging and SYS_VAR modification, these statements
# 			make the required changes to the account:
#
# 				GRANT BINLOG_ADMIN, SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'u1'@'localhost';
# 				REVOKE SUPER ON *.* FROM 'u1'@'localhost';
#
# 			After said modifications the query in point 1. should return empty in terms of Querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
#
# GRANT TABLES
#
# The mysql System database includes several grant tables that contain information about user accounts and the
# privs held by them.
#
# This section describes those tables.
#
# To manipulate the contents of grant tables, modify them indirectly by using account-management statements such as
# CREATE_USER, GRANT and REVOKE to set up accounts and control the privileges available to each one.
#
# The discussion here describes the underlying structure of the grant tables and how the server uses their
# contents when interacting with clients.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Direct modification of grant tables using statements such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE is didscouraged and done at your own risk.
# 		The server is free to ignore rows that become malformed as a result of such modifications.
#
# 		For any operation that modifies a grant table, the server checks whether the table has the expected structure and produces an
# 		error if not.
#
# 		mysql_upgrade must be run to update the tables to the expected structure.
#
# These mysql database tables contain grant information:
#
# 		) user: User accounts, global privs and other non-priv columns
#
# 		) global_grants: Assignments of dynamic global privileges to users
#
# 		) db: Database-level privileges
#
# 		) tables_priv: Table-level privs
#
# 		) columns_priv: Column-level privs
#
# 		) procs_priv: Stored procedure and function privs
#
# 		) proxies_priv: Proxy-user privs
#
# 		) default_roles: Default user roles
#
# 		) role_edges: Edges for role subgraphs
#
# 		) password_history: Password changes
#
# In MySQL 8.0, grant tables use the InnoDB storage engine and are transactional.
# Before MySQL 8.0, grant tables used the MyISAM storage engine and were nontransactional.
#
# This change of grant tables storage engine enables an accompanying change to the behavior of account-management statements 
# such as CREATE_USER or GRANT.
#
# Previously, an account-management statement that named multiple users could succeed for some users and fail for others.
#
# Now, each statement is transactional and either succeeds for all named users or rolls back and has no effect if any
# error occurs.
#
# Each grant table contains scope columns and privilege columns:
#
# 		) Scope columns determine the scope of each row in the tables; taht is, the context in which the row applies.
#
# 			For example, a user table row with Host and User values of 'h1.example.net' and 'bob' applies to authenticating
# 			connections made to the server from the host h1.example.net by a client that specifies a user name of bob.
#
# 			Similarly, a db table row with Host, User and Db column values of 'h1.example.net', 'bob' and 'reports' applies
# 			when bob connects from the host h1.example.net to access the reports database.
#
# 			The tables_priv and columns_priv tables contain scope columns indicating tables or table/column combinations
# 			to which each row applies.
#
# 			The procs_priv scope columns indicate the stored routine to which each row applies.
#
# 		) Privilege columns indicate which priv a table row grants; that is, which operations it permits to be performed.
#
# 			The server combines the information in the various grant tables to form a complete description of a user's privs.
#
# 			Rules described later.
#
# The server uses the grant tables in the following manner:
#
# 		) The user table scope columns determine whether to reject or permit incoming connections.
#
# 			For permitted connections, any privileges granted in the user table indicate the user's global privs.
# 			Any privileges granted in this table apply to all databases on the server.
#
# 				CAUTION: 
#
# 					Because any global privilege is considered a privilege for all databases, any global privilege enables a user to 
# 					see all database names with SHOW_DATABASES or by examining the SCHEMA table of INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
#
# 		) The global_grants table lists current assignments of dynamic privileges to user accounts.
#
# 		) The db table scope columns determine which users can access which databases from which hosts.
# 			The privilege columns determine the permitted operations.
#
# 			A privilege granted at the database level applies to the database and to all objects in teh database,
# 			such as tables and stored programs.
#
# 		) The tables_priv and columns_priv tables are similar to the db table, but are more fine-grained:
# 			They apply at the table and column levels rather than at the database level.
#
# 			A privilege granted at the table level applies to the table and to all its columns.
# 			A privilege granted at the column level applies only to a specific column.
#
# 		) The procs_priv table applies to stored routines (stored procedures and functions).
# 			A privilege granted at the routine level applies only to a single procedure or function.
#
# 		) The proxies_priv table indicates which users can act as proxies for other users and whether a user
# 			can grant the PROXY privilege to other users.
#
# 		) The default_roles and role_edges tables contain information about role releationships.
#
# 		) The password_history table retains previously chosen passwords to enable restrictions on password reuse.
#
# The server uses the user and db tables in the mysql database at both the first and second stages of access control.
# The columns in the user and db tables are shown as follows::
#
# TABLE NAME 					user 									db
#
# Scope COlumns 				Host 									Host
# 									User 									Db
# 																			User
#

# 
# Resource control columns max_questions
# 									max_updates
# 									max_connections
# 									max_user_connections
#
# The user table plugin and authentication_string columns store authentication plugin and credential information.
#
# The server uses the plugin named in the plugin column of an account row to authenticate connection attempts for the account.
#
# The plugin column must be nonempty. At startup, and at runtime when FLUSH_PRIVILEGES is executed, the server checks user table rows.
# For any row with an empty plugin column, the server writes a warning to the error log of this form:
#
# [Warning] User entry 'user_name'@'host_name' has an empty plugin value.
# The user will be ignored and no one can login with this user anymore.
#
# The password_expired column permits DBAs to expire account PWs and require users to reset their password.
# The default password_expired value is 'N', but can be set to 'Y' with the ALTER_USER statement.
#
# After an account's password has been expired, all operations performed by the account in subsequent connections
# to the server result in an error until the user issues an ALTER_USER statement to establish a new account pw.
#
# It is possible after PW expiration to "reset" a PW by setting it to its current value.
# As a matter of good policy, it is preferable to choose a different PW.
#
# DBAs can enforce non-reuse by establishing an appropiate password-reuse policy.
#
# password_last_changed is a TIMESTAMP column indicating when the password was last changed.
#
# The value is non-NULL only for accounts that use a MySQL built-in authentication plugin (mysql_native_password,
# 	sha256_password or caching_sha2_password)
#
# The value is NULL for other accounts, such as those authenticated using an external authentication system.
#
# Password_last_changed is updated by the CREATE_USER, ALTER_USER and SET_PASSWORD statements, and by GRANT
# statements that create an account or change an account PW.
#
# password_lifetime indicates the account password lifetime, in days. 
#
# If the password is past its lifetime (assessed using the password_last_changed column), the server considers
# the password expired when clients connect using the account.
#
# A value of N greater than zero means that het PW must be changed every N days.
# A value of 0 disables automatic PW expiration.
#
# if the value is NULL (default), the global expiration policy applies, as defined by the default_password_lifetime
# SYS_VARs.
#
# account_locked indicates whether the haccount is locked.
#
# Password_reuse_history is the value of the PASSWORD_HISTORY option for the account, or NULL for the default history.
#
# Password_reuse_time is the value of the PASSWORD_REUSE_INTERVAL option for the account, or NULL for the default interval.
#
# Password_require_current (available as of MySQL 8.0.13), corresponds to the value of the PASSWORD REQUIRE option for
# the account.
#
# PASSWORD_REQUIRE_CURRENT value 		CORRESPONDING PASSWORD REQUIRE OPTION
#
# 'Y' 											PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT
#
# 'N' 											PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL
#
# NULL 											PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT
#
# During the second stage of access control, the server performs request verification to ensure that each
# client has sufficient privs for each request that it issues.
#
# In addition to the user and db grant tables, teh server may also consult the tables_priv and columns_priv tables
# for requests that involve tables.
#
# The latter tables provide finer privilege control at the table and column levels.
# They have the columns shown in the following table.
#
# 
# Table Name 				TABLES_PRIV 				COLUMNS_PRIV
#
# Scope COlumns 			Host 							Host
# 								Db 							Db
# 								User 							User
# 								Table_name 					Table_name
# 																Column_name
# Privilege columns 		Table_priv 					Column_priv
# 								Column_priv
# Other columns 			Timestamp 					Timestamp
# 								Grantor
#
# The Timestamp and Grantor columns are set to the current timestamp and the CURRENT_USER value, respectively, but are otherwise
# unused.
#
# For verification of requests that involve stored routines, the server may consult the procs_priv table, which has the
# columns shown as follows:
#
# 		procs_priv TABLE COLUMNS
#
# 			Table Name 					procs_priv
#
# Scope columns 						Host
# 											Db
# 											User
# 											Routine_name
# 											Routine_type
#
# Privlege columns 					Proc_priv
# Other columns 						Timestamp
# 											Grantor
#
# The Routine_type column is an ENUM column with values of 'FUNCTION' or 'PROCEDURE' to indicate the type of
# routine the row refers to.
#
# This column enables privileges to be granted separately for a function and a procedure with the same name.
#
# The Timestamp and Grantor columns are unused.
#
# The proxies_priv table records information about proxy accounts. It has these columns:
#
# 		) Host, User: The proxy account; that is, the account that has the PROXY privilege for the proxied account.
#
# 		) Proxied_host, Proxied_user: The proxied account
#
# 		) Grantor, Timestamp: Unused.
#
# 		) With_grant: Whether the proxy account can grant the proxy privlege to other accounts.
#
# For an account to be able to grant the PROXY privs to otehr accounts, it must have a row in the proxies_priv table
# with With_grant set to 1 and Proxied_host and Proxied_user set to indicate the account or accounts for which
# the priv can be granted.
#
# For example, the 'root'@'localhost' account created during MySQL installation has a row in the proxies_priv table that
# enables granting the PROXY privs for ''@'', that is, for all users and all hosts.
#
# This enables root to set up proxy users, as well as to delegate to other accounts the authority to set up proxy users.
#
# The global_grants table lists current assignments of dynamic privileges to user accounts.
# These privileges are global.
#
# The table has these columns:
#
# 		) USER, HOST: The user name and host name of the account to which the priv is granted.
#
# 		) PRIV: The priv name
#
# 		) WITH_GRANT_OPTION: Whether the account can grant the privlege to other accounts.
#
# The default_roles table lists default user roles. It has these columns:
#
# 		) HOST, USER: The account or role to which the default role applies.
#
# 		) DEFAULT_ROLE_HOST, DEFAULT_ROLE_USER: The default role.
#
# The role_edges table lists edges for role subgraphs. It has these columns:
#
# 		) FROM_HOST, FROM_USER: The account that is granted a role.
#
# 		) TO_HOST, TO_USER: The role that is granted to the account.
#
# 		) WITH_ADMIN_OPTION: Whether the account can grant the role to and revoke it from other accounts by using WITH ADMIN OPTION.
#
# The password_history table contains information about password changes.
# It has these columns:
#
# 		Host, User: The account for which the password change occurred.
#
# 		Password_timestamp: The time when the password change occurred.
#
# 		Password: The new password hash value.
#
# The password_history table accumulates a sufficient number of nonempty PWs per account to enable MySQL to perform
# checks against both the acc PW history length and reuse interval.
#
# Automatic pruning of entries that are outside both limits occurs when password-change attempts occur.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The empty password does not count in the password history and is subject to reuse at any time.
#
# If an account is renamed, its entries are renamed to match. If an account is dropped or its authentication plugin is changed,
# its entries are removed.
#
# Scope columns in the grant tables contain strings. The default value for each is the empty string.
# The following table shows the number of characters permitted in each column.
#
# GRANT TABLE SCOPE COLUMN LENGTHS
#
# Column Name 					Maximum Permitted Characters
#
# Host, Proxied_host 		60
# User, Proxied_user 		32
# Db 								64
# Table_name 					64
# Column_name 					64
# Routine_name 				64
#
# For access-checking purposes, comparisons of User, Proxied_user, authentication_string, Db and Table_name values are case-sensitive.
#
# Comparisons of Host, Proxied_host, Column_name and Routine_name values are not case-sensitive.
#
# The user and db tables list each priv in a separate column taht is declared as ENUM('N','Y') DEFAULT 'N'.
# In other words, each privilege can be disabled or eanbled, with the default being disabled.
#
# The tables_priv, columns_priv and procs_priv tables declare the priv column as SET columns.
# Vlaues in these columns can contain any combination of the priv controlled by the table.
#
# Only those privs listed in the column value are enabled.
#
# Set-type priv column values
#
# 	TABLE NAME 			COLUMN NAME 				POSSIBLE SET ELEMENTS
#
# tables_priv 			Table_priv 				'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'Delete', 'Create',
# 														'Drop', 'Grant', 'References', 'Index', 'Alter',

# columns_priv 		Column_priv 			'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'References'
#
# procs_priv 			Proc_priv 				'Execute', 'Alter Routine', 'Grant'
#
# Only the user table specifies admin privs, such as RELOAD and SHUTDOWN.
#
# Admin operations are operations on the server itself and are not database-specific, so there is no reason
# to list these privs in the other grant tables.
#
# Consequently, the server need consult only the user table to determine whether a user can perform
# an administrative operation.
#
# The FILE priv also is specified only in the user table.
#
# It is not an administrative priv as such, but a user's ability to read or write files on the server host
# is independent of the DB being accesed.
#
# The server reads the contents of the grant tables into memory when it starts.
# You can tell it to reload the tables by issuing a FLUSH_PRIVILEGES statement or executing a mysqladmin flush-privileges or mysqladmin reload command.
#
# Changes to teh grant tables take effect as indicated.
#
# When you modify an account, it is a good idea to verify that your changes have the intended effect.
# To check the privs for a given account, use the SHOW_GRANTS statement.
#
# For example, to determine the privs that are granted to an account with user name and host name values of bob and pc84.example.com,
# use this statement:
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'bob'@'pc84.example.com';
#
# To display nonpriv properties of an account, use SHOW_CREATE_USER:
#
# 		SHOW CREATE USER 'bob'@'pc84.example.com';
#
# SPECIFYING ACCOUNT NAMES
#
# MySQL account names consists of a user name and a host name.
# This enables creation of accounts for users with the same name who can connect from different hosts.
#
# This section describes how to write account names, including special values and wildcard rules.
#
# MySQL role names are similar to account names, with some differences.
#
# In SQL statements such as CREATE_USER, GRANT, and SET_PASSWORD account names follow these rules:
#
# 		) Account name syntax is 'user_name'@'host_name'
#
# 		) An account name consisting only of a user name is equivalent to 'user_name'@'%'.
#  	  For example, 'me' is equivalent to 'me'@'%'
#
# 		) The user name and host name need not be quoted if they are legal as unquoted identifiers.
# 			Quotes are necessary to specify a user_name string containing special chars (such as space or -)
#
# 			or a host_name string containing special characters or wildchar characters (such as . or %); for example,
# 			'test-user'@'%.com'
#
# 		) Quote user names and host names as identifiers or as strings, using either backticks (`), single quotation marks ('),
# 			or double quotation marks (")
#
# 			For string-quoting and identifier-quoting guidelines, see later.
#
# 		) The user name and host name parts, if quoted, must be quoted separately.
#
# 			That is, write 'me'@'localhost', not 'me@localhost'; the latter is equivalent to 'me@localhost'@'%'
#
# 		) A reference to the CURRENT_USER or CURRENT_USER() function is equivalent to specifying the current client's user name
# 			and host name literally.
#
# MySQL stores account names in grant tables in the mysql system database using separate columns for the user name and host name parts:
#
# 		) The user table contains one row for each account. The User and Host columns store the user name and host name.
#
# 			This table also indicates which global privileges the account has.
#
# 		) Other grant tables indicate privileges an account has for databases and objects within databases.
#
# 			These tables have User and Host columns to store the account name.
# 			Each row in these tables associates with the account in the user table that has the same User and Host  values.
#
# 		) For access-checking purposes, comparisons of User values are case-sensitive. Comparisons of Host values are not case sensiive.
#
# For additional detail about grant table structure, see earlier.
#
# User names and host names have certain special values or wildcard conventions, as described:
#
# The user name part of an account name is either a nonblank value that literally matches the user name for incoming connection attempts,
# or a blank value (empty string) that matches any user name.
#
# An account with a blank user name is an anonymous user. To specify an anon user in SQL statements, use a quoted empty user name part,
# such as ''@'localhost'
#
# The host name part of an account name can take many forms, and wildcards are permitted:
#
# 		) A host value can be a host name or an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
#
# 			The name 'localhost' indicates the local host. The IP address '127.0.0.1' indicates teh IPv4 loopback interface.
# 			The IP address '::1' is the IPv6 loopback interface.
#
# 		) The % and _ wildcard characters are permitted in host name or IP address values.
#
# 			These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations performed with the LIKE operator.
#
# 			For example, a host value of '%' matches any host name, whereas a value of '%.mysql.com' matches
# 			any host in the mysql.com domain.
#
# 			'198.51.100.%' matches any host in the 198.51.100 class C network.
#
# 			Because IP wildcard values are permitted in host values (for example '198.51.100.%' to match every host on a subset),
# 			someone could try to exploit this capability by naming a host 198.51.100.somewhere.com
#
# 			To foil such attempts, MySQL does not perform matching on host names that start with digits and a dot.
# 			For example, if a host is named 1.2.example.com, its name never matches the host part of account names.
#
# 			An IP wildcard value can match only IP addresses, not host names.
#
# 		) For a host value specified as an IPv4 address, a netmask can be given to indicate how many address bits to use for the
# 			network number.
#
# 			Netmask notation cannot be used for IPv6 addresses.
#
# 			The syntax is host_ip/netmask. For example:
#
# 				CREATE USER 'david'@'198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0';
#
# 			This enables david to connect from any client host having an IP address client_ip for which the following condition is true:
#
# 				client_ip & netmask = host_ip
#
# 			That is, for the CREATE_USER statement just shown:
#
# 				client_ip & 255.255.255.0 = 198.51.100.0
#
# 			IP addresses that satisfy this condition range from 198.51.100.0 to 198.51.100.255
#
# 			A netmask typically begins with bits set to 1, followed by bits set to 0. Examples:
#
# 				) 198.0.0.0/255.0.0.0: Any host on the 198 class A network
#
# 				) 198.51.100.0/255.255.0.0: Any host on the 198.51 class B network
#
# 				) 198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0: Any host on the 198.51.100 class C network
#
# 				) 198.51.100.1: Only the host with this specific IP address
#
# The server performs matching of host values in account names against the client host using the value returned
# by the system DNS resolver for the client host name or IP address.
#
# Except in the case that the account host value is specified using netmask notation, the server performs this comparison
# as a string match, even for an account host value given as an IP address.
#
# This means that you should specify account host values in the same format used by DNS.
# Here are examples of problems to watch out for:
#
# 		) Suppose that a host on the local network has a fully qualified name of host1.example.com
# 			If DNS returns name lookups for this host as host1.example.com, use that name in account host values.
#
# 			If DNS returns just host1, use host1 instead.
#
# 		) If the DNS returns the IP address for a given host as 198.51.100.2, that will match an account host value of 198.51.100.2
# 			but not 198.051.100.2
#
# 			Similarly, it will match a pattern of 198.51.100.% but not 198.051.100.%
#
# To avoid problems like these, it is advisable to check the format in which your DNS returns host names and addresses.
# Use values in the same format in MySQL account names.
#
# SPECIFYING ROLE NAMES
#
# MySQL role names refer to roles, which are named collections of privs.
# For role usage example, see later.
#
# Role names have syntax and semantics similar to account names (later).
# Role names differ from account names in these respects:
#
# 		) The user part of role names cannot be blank. Thus, there is no "anon role" analogous to the concept of "anon user".
#
# 		) As for an account name, omitting the host part of a role name results in a host part of '%'.
# 			But unlike '%' in an account name, a host part of '%' in a role name has no wildcard props.
#
# 			For example, for a name 'me'@'%' used as a role name, teh host part '%', the host part ('%'), is just a ltieral value - not a wildcard.
#
# 		) Netmask notation in the host part of a role name has no significance.
#
# 		) An account name is permitted to be CURRENT_USER() in several contexts. A role name is not.
#
# It is possible for a row in the mysql.user system table to serve as both an account and a role.
#
# In this case, any special user or host name matching properties do not apply in contexts for which
# the name is used as a role name.
#
# For example, you cannot execute the following statement with the expectation that it will set the current
# session roles using all roles that have a user part of myrole and any host name:
#
# 		SET ROLE 'myrole'@'%';
#
# Instead, the statement sets the active role for the session to the role with exactly the name 'myrole'@'%'
#
# For this reason, role names are often specified using only the user name part and letting the host name part implicitly
# be '%'.
#
# Specifying a role with a non '%' host part can be useful if you intend to create a name that works as both a role and a user account
# that is permitted to connect from the given host. 
#
# ACCESS CONTROL, STAGE 1: CONNECTION VERIFICATION
#
# When you attempt to connect to a MySQL server, the server accepts or rejects the connection based on these conditions:
#
# 		) Your identity and whether you can verify your identity by supplying the correct PW
#
# 		) Whether your account is locked or unlocked.
#
# The server checks credentials first, then account locking state. A failure fo either step causes the server to deny access to
# you completely.
#
# Otherwise, the server accepts the connection and then enters Stage 2 and waits for requests.
#
# Credential checking is performed using the three user table scope columns (Host, User and authentication_string).
# Locking state is recorded in the user table account_locked column.
#
# The server accepts the connection only if the Host and User columns in some User table row match the client host
# and user name, the client supplies the PW specified in that row, and the account_locked value is 'N'.
#
# The rules for permissible Host and User value are given later.
#
# Account locking can be changed with the ALTER_USER statement.
#
# Your identity is based on two pieces of information:
#
# 		) The client host from which you connect.
#
# 		) Your MySQL user name
#
# If the User column value is nonblank, the user name in an incoming connection must match exactly.
# If the User value is blank, it matches any user name.
#
# If the user table row that matches an incoming connection has a blank user name, the user is considered to be anon without a name,
# not a user with the name that the client actually specified.
#
# This means that a blank user name is used for all further access checking for the duration of the connection (Stage 2).
#
# The authentication_string column can be blank. This is not a wildcard and does not mean that any PW matches.
#
# It means that the user must connect without specifying a PW. If the server authenticates a client using a plugin,
# the authentication method that the plugin implements may or may not use the PW in the authentication_string column.
#
# In this case, it is possible that an external PW is also used to authenticate to the MySQL server.
#
# Nonblank authentication_string values in the user table represent encrypted PWs.
# MySQL does not store PWs in cleartext form for anyone to see.
#
# Rather, the PW supplied by a user who is attempting to connect is encrypted (using the PW hashing method implemented by the
# account authentication plugin).
#
# The encrypted PW then is used during the connection process when checking whether the PW is correct.
# This is done without the encrypted PW ever traveling over the connection.
#
# From MySQL's PoV, the encrypted PW is the real pw, so you should never give anyone access to it.
#
# In particular, do not give nonadmin users read access to tables in the mysql system db.
#
# The following table shows various combinations of User and Host values in teh User table apply to incoming connections.
#
# User Value  Host Value  		Permissible Connections
#
# 'fred' 	'h1.example.net' 	fred, connecting from h1.example.net
#
# '' 			'h1.example.net' 	Any user, connecting from h1.example.net
#
# 'fred' 	'%' 					fred, from any host
#
# '' 			'%' 					Any user, connecting from any host
#
# 'fred'  	'%.example.net' 	fred, any host in the example.net domain
#
# 'fred' 	'x.example.%' 		fred, from any x.example.<extension>, where <extension> is wildcarded
#
# 'fred' 	'198.51.100.177' 	fred, connecting from the host with IP address 198.51.100.177
#
# 'fred' 	'198.51.100.%' 	fred, from any host in the 198.51.100 class C subnet
#
# 'fred'		'198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0' - Same as previous
#
# It is possible for the client host name and user name of an incoming connection to match more than one row in the user table.
# The preceding set of examples demonstrates this: Several of the entries shown match a connection from h1.example.net by fred.
#
# When multiple matches are possible, the server must determine which of them to use.
# It resolves this issue as follows:
#
# 		) Whenever the server reads the user table into memory, it sorts the rows.
#
# 		) When a client attempts to connect, the server looks through the rows in sorted order.
#
# 		) The server uses the first row that matches the client host name and user name.
#
# The server uses sorting rules that order rows with the most specific Host values first.
# Literal host names and IP addresses are the most specific.
#
# (The specificity of a literal IP address is not affected by whether it has a netmask, so,
# 198.51.100.13 and 198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0 are considered equally specific)
#
# The pattern '%' means "any host" and is least specific.
#
# The empty string '' also means "any host" but sorts after '%'.
#
# Rows with the same Host value are ordered with the most-specific User values first
# (a blank User value means "any user" and is least specific).
#
# For rows with equally-specific Host and User values, the order is nondeterministic.
#
# To see how this works, suppose that the user table looks like this:
#
# 		+------------------+----------+-
# 		| Host 				 | User 		| ...
# 		+------------------+----------+-
# 		| % 					 | root 		| ...
# 		| % 					 | jeffrey 	| ...
# 		| localhost 		 | root 	 	| ...
# 		| localhost 		 | 			| ...
# 		+------------------+----------+-
#
# When the reads the table into memory, it sorts the rows using the rules just described.
# The result after sorting looks like this:
#
# 		+------------------+----------+-
# 		| Host 				 | User 		| ...
# 		+------------------+----------+-
# 		| localhost 		 | root 		| ...
# 		| localhost 		 | 			| ...
# 		| % 					 | jeffrey 	| ...
# 		| % 					 | root 		| ...
# 		+------------------+----------+-
#
# When a client attempts to connect, the server looks through the sorted rows and uses the first match found.
#
# For a connection from localhost by jeffrey, two of the rows from the table match: the one with Host and User values of
# 'localhost' and '', and the one with values of '%' and 'jeffrey'.
#
# The 'localhost' row appears first in sorted order, so that is the one the server uses.
#
# Here is another example. Suppose that the user table looks like this:
#
# +----------------------------------+------------+-
# | Host 									 | User 		  | ...
# +----------------------------------+------------+-
# | % 										 | jeffrey 	  | ...
# | h1.example.net 						 | 			  | ...
# +----------------------------------+------------+-
#
# The sorted table looks like this:
#
# +----------------------------------+------------+-
# | Host 									 | User 		  | ...
# +----------------------------------+------------+-
# | h1.example.net 						 | 			  | ...
# | % 										 | jeffrey 	  | ...
# +----------------------------------+------------+-
#
# A connection by jeffrey from h1.example.net is matched by the first row, whereas a connection by jeffrey from any host is
# matched by the second.
#
# Note:
#
# 		It is a common misconception to think that, for a given user name, all rows that explicitly name that user are used
# 		first when the server attempts to find a match for the connection.
#
# 		This is not true.
#
# 		The preceding example illustrates this, where a connection from h1.example.net by jeffrey is first matched
# 		not by the row containing 'jeffrey' as the User column value, but by the row with no user name.
# 		
# 		As a result, jeffrey is authenticated as an anon user, even though he specified a user name when connecting.
#
# If you are able to connect to the server, but your privileges are not what you expect, you probably are being
# authenticated as some other account.
#
# To find out what account you were authenticated as, use the CURRENT_USER() function.
#
# It returns a value in <user_name>@<host_name> format that indicates the User and Host values from the matching
# user table row.
#
# Suppose that jeffrey connects and issues the following query:
#
# 		SELECT CURRENT_USER();
# 		+-----------------------+
# 		| CURRENT_USER() 			|
# 		+-----------------------+
# 		| @localhost 			   |
# 		+-----------------------+
#
# The result shown here indicates that the matching user table row had a blank User column value.
# In other words, the server is treating jeffrey as a anon user.
#
# Another way to diagnose authentication problems is to print out the user table and sort it by hand
# to see where the first match is being made.
#
# ACCESS CONTROL, STAGE 2: REQUEST VERIFICATION
#
# After you establish a connection, the server enters Stage 2 of access control.
#
# For each request that you issue through that connection, the server determines what operation you want to perform,
# then checks whether you have sufficient privs to do so.
#
# This is where the privilege column in the grant tables come into play.
# These privileges can come from any of the user, db, tables_priv, columns_priv or procs_priv tables.
# 
# The user table grants privileges that are assigned to you on a global basis and that apply no matter what
# the default database is.
#
# For example, if the user table grants you the DELETE privilege, you can delete rows from any table in any database
# on the server host.
#
# It is wise to grant privileges in the user table only to people who need them, such as database admins.
#
# For other users, you should leave all privileges in the user table set to 'N' and grant privileges at more specific
# levels only.
#
# You can grant privileges for particular databases, tables, columns or routines.
#
# The db table grants database-specific privileges. Values in the scope columns of this table can take the following forms:
#
# 		) A blank User value matches the anon user. A nonblank value matches literally; there are no wildcards in user names.
#
# 		) The wildcard characters % and _ can be used in the Host and Db columns.
#
# 			These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operatons performed with the LIKE operator..
# 			If you want to use either character literally when granting privileges, you must escape it with a backslash.
#
# 			For example, to include the underscore character (_) as part of a database name, specify it as \_ in the GRANT statement.
#
# 		) A '%' or blank Host value means "any host".
#
# 		) A '%' or blank Db value means 'any db'.
#
# The server reads the db table into memory and sorts it at the same time that it reads the user table.
# The server sorts the db table based on the Host, Db and User scope columns.
#
# As with the user table, sorting puts the most-specific values first and least-specific values last, and when
# the server looks for matching rows, it uses the first match that it finds.
#
# The tables_priv, columns_priv and procs_priv tables grant table-specific, column-specific and routine-specific privs.
#
# Values in the scope columns of these tables can take the following forms:
#
# 		) The wildcard characters % and _ can be used in the Host column. 
# 			These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations performed with the LIKE operator.
#
# 		) A '%' or blank Host value means "any host".
#
# 		) The Db, Table_name, Column_name, and Routine_name columns cannot contain wildcards or be blank.
#
# The server sorts the tables_priv, columns_priv and procs_priv tables based on the Host, Db and User columns.
# This is similar to db table sorting, but simpler because only the Host column can contain wildcards.
#
# The server uses the sorted tables to verify each request that it receives.
#
# For requests that require administrative such as SHUTDOWN or RELOAD, the server checks
# only the user table row because that is the only table that specifies admin privs. 
#
# The server grants access if the row permits the requested operation and denies access otherwise.
#
# For example, if you want to execute mysqladmin shutdown but your user table row does not grant the
# SHUTDOWN priv to you, the server denies access without even checking the db table. 
#
# (It contains no shutdown_priv column, so there is no need to do so)
#
# For database-related requests (INSERT, UPDATE and so on), teh server fist checks the user's global privs by looking in the
# user table row.
#
# If the row permits the requested operation, access is granted.
#
# If the global priv in the user table are insufficient, the server determines the user's db-specific privs by checking
# the db table:
#
# 		The server looks in the db table for a match on the Host, Db and User columns.
# 		The Host and User columns are matched to the connecting user's host name and MySQL user name.
#
# 		The Db column is matched to the database that the user wants to access.
#
# 		If there is no row for the Host and User, access is denied.
#
# After determining the db-specific privs granted by the db table rows, the server adds them to the global privs
# granted by the user table.
#
# If the result permits the requested operation, access is granted.
#
# Otherwise, teh server successively checks the user's table and column privs in the tables_priv and columns_priv tables,
# adds those to the user's priv and permits or denies access based on the result.
#
# For stored-routine operations, the server uses the procs_priv table rather than tables_priv and columns_priv.
#
# Expressed in boolean terms, the preceding desc. of how a user's privs are calculated may be summarized as:
#
# 		global privileges
# 		OR (database privs AND host privs)
# 		OR table privs
# 		OR column privs
# 		OR routine privs
#
# It may not be apparent why, if the global user row privs are initially found to be insufficient for the requested operation,
# the server adds those privs to the database, table and column privs later.
#
# The reason is that a request might require more than one type of privilege.
# For example, if you execute an INSERT_INTO_..._SELECT statement, you need both the INSERT and SELECT privs.
#
# Your privs might be such that the user table row grants one priv and the db table row grants the other.
#
# In this case, you have the necessary privs to perform the request, but the server cannot tell that from either
# table by itself; the privs granted by the rows in both tables must be combined.
#
# WHEN PRIVILEGE CHANGES TAKE EFFECT
#
# When mysqld starts, it reads all grant tables contents into memory. The in-memory tables become effective for access control at that point.
#
# If you modify the grant tables indirectly using account-management statements such as GRANT, REVOKE, SET_PASSWORD or RENAME_USER, the server
# notices these changes and loads the grant tables into memory again immediately.
#
# If you modify the grant tables directly using statements such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE, your changes have no effect on priv checking
# until you either restart the server or tell it to reload the tables.
#
# If you change the grant tables directly but forget to reload them, your change have no effect until you restart the server.
# This may leave you wondering why your changes seem to make no difference.
#
# To tell teh server to reload the grant tables, perform a flush-priv operation. This can be done by issuing a FLUSH_PRIVILEGES statement
# or by executing a mysqladmin flush-privileges or mysqladmin reload command.
#
# A grant table reload affects privs for each existing client connection as follows:
#
# 		) Table and column privilege changes take effect with the client's next request.
#
# 		) Database privs changes take effect the next time the client executes a USE <db_name> statment.
#
# 			NOTE: Client applications mayy cache the database name: thus, this effect may not be visible to them without actually changing to a different database.
#
# 		) Global privileges and passwords are unaffected for a connected client. These changes take effect only for subsequent connections.
#
# If the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option, it does not read the grant tables or implement any access control.
#
# Anyone can connect and do anything, which is insecure.
#
# To cause a server thus started to read the tables and enable access checking, flush the privileges.
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING PROBLEMS CONNECTING TO MYSQL
#
# If you encounter problems when you try to connect to the MySQL server, the following items describe some courses
# of action you can take to correct the problem.
#
# 		) Make sure that the server is running. If it is not, clients cannot connect to it.
#
# 			For example, if an attempt to connect to the servers fails with a message such as one of those following,
# 			one cause might be that the server is not running:
#
# 				mysql
# 				ERROR 2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on 'host_name' (111)
# 				mysql
# 				ERROR 2002: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
# 				'/tmp/mysql.sock' (111)
#
# 		) It might be that the server is running, but you are trying to connect using a TCP/IP port, named pipe, or Unix socket
# 			file different from the one on which the server is listening.
#
# 			To correct this when you invoke a client program, specify a --port option to indicate the proper port number or a 
# 			--socket option to indicate the proper named pipe or Unix socket file.
#
# 			To find out where the socket file is, you can use this command:
#
# 				netstat -ln | grep mysql
#
# 		) Make sure that the server has not been configured to ignore network connections or (if you are attempting to connect
# 			remotely) that it has not been configured to listen only locally on its network interfaces.
#
# 			If the server was started with --skip-networking, it will not accept TPC/IP connections at all.
#
# 			If the server was started with --bind-address=127.0.0.1, it will listen for TCP/IP connections only locally
# 			on the loopback interface and will not accept remote connections.
#
# 		) Check to make sure that there is no firewall blocking access to MySQL. Your firewall may be configured on the basis
# 			of the application being executed, or the port number used by MySQL for communication (3306 by default).
#
# 			Under Linux or Unix, check your IP tables (or similar) configuration to ensure that the port has not been
# 			blocked.
#
# 			under Windows, applications such as ZoneAlarm or Windows Firewall may need to be configured not to block the MySQL port.
#
# 		) The grant table must be properly set up so that the server can use them for access control.
#
# 			For some distrib types (such as binary on Windows or RPM distribs on Linux), the installation process initializes the MySQL
# 			data dir, including the mysql system db containing the grant tables.
#
# 			For distribs that do not do this, you must initialize the data dir manually.
#
# 			To determine whether you need to initialize the grant tables, look for a mysql dir under the data dir.
# 			(The data dir normally is named data or var and is located under your MySQL installation dir).
#
# 			Make sure that you have a file named user.MYD in the mysql database directory.
#
# 			If not, initialize the data directory. After doing so and starting the server, you should be able to connect to the server.
#
# 		) After a fresh installation, if you log on to the server as root without using a password, you might get the following error message.
#
# 			mysql -u root
#			ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
#
# 			It means a root PW has already been assigned during installation and it has to be supplied.
#
# 			More on resetting etc., later.
#
# 		) If you have updated an existing MySQL installaiton to a newer version, did you run the mysql_upgrade script?
#
# 			If not, do so.
#
# 			The structure of the grant tables changes ocassionaly when new capabilties are added, so after an upgrade you should
# 			always make sure that your tables have the current structure.
#
# 		) If a client program receives the following error message when it tries to connect, it means that hte server expects
# 			passwords in a newer format than the client is capable of generating:
#
# 				mysql
# 				Client does not support authentication protocol requested
# 				by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
#
# 		) Remmber that client programs use connection parameters specified in option files or environment variables.
#
# 			If a client program seems to be sending incorrect default connection params when you have not specified them on teh cmd line,
# 			check any applicable option file and ENV variables.
#
# 			For example, if you get Access denied when you run a client without any options, make sure that you have not specified an
# 			old password in any of your option files.
#
# 			You can suppress the use of option files by a client program by invoking it with the --no-defaults option.
# 			For example:
#
# 				mysqladmin --no-defaults -u root version
#
# 		) If you get the following error, it means that you are using an incorrect root pw:
#
# 			mysqladmin -u root -pxxx ver
# 			Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
#
# 			If the preceding error occurs when you have not specified a PW, it means that you have an incorrect PW listed in some option file.
# 			Try the --no-defaults option as described in the previous item.
#
# 		) localhost is a synonym for your local host name, and is also the default host to which clients try to connect if you specify no host explicitly.
#
# 			You can use a --host=127.0.0.1 option to name the server host explicitly.
#
# 			This will make TCP/IP connection to the local mysqld server.
#
# 			You can also use TCP/IP by specifying a --host option that uses the actual host name of the local host.
# 			In this case, the host name must be specified in a user table row on the server host, even though you are
# 			running the client program on the same host as the server.
#
# 		) The Access denied error message tells you who you are trying to log in as, the client host from which you are
# 			trying to connect, and whether you were using a password.
#
# 			Normally, you should have one row in tthe user table that exactly matches the host name and user name that
# 			were given in the error message.
#
# 			For example, if you get an error message that contains using password: NO, it means that you tried to log in without a PW.
#
# 		) If you get an Access denied error when trying to connect to the db with mysql -u <user_name>, you may have a problem with the
# 			user table.
#
# 			Check this by executing mysql -u root mysql and issuing this SQL statement:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM user;
#
# 			The result should include a row with the Host and User columns matching your client's host name and your MySQL user name.
#
# 		) if the following error occurs when you try to connect from a host other than the one on which the MySQL server is running,
# 			it means that there is no row in the user table with a Host value that matches the client host:
#
# 				Host ... is not allowed to connect to this MySQL Server
#
# 			You can fix this by setting up an account for the combination of client host name and user name that you are using when trying to connect.
#
# 			If you do not know the IP address or host name of the machine from which you are connecting, you should put a row with '%' as the Host column
# 			value in the user table.
#
# 			After trying to connect from the client machine, use a SELECT USER() query to see how you really did connect.
#
# 			Then change the '%' in the user table row to the actual host name that shows up in the log.
#
# 			Otherwise, your system is left insecure because it permits any host for the given user name.
#
# 			On Linux, another reason that this error might occur is that you are using a binary MySQL version that is compiled with
# 			a different version of the glibc library than the one you are using.
#
# 			In this case, you should either upgrade your OS system or glibc, or download a source distrib of MySQL version and compile
# 			it yourself.
#
# 			A source RPM is normally trivial to compile and install, so this is not a big problem.
#
# 		) If you specify a host name when trying to connect, but get an error message where the host name is not shown or is an IP address,
# 			it means that the mySQL server got an error when trying to resolve the IP address of the client host to a name:
#
# 				mysqladmin -u root -pxxx -h some_hostname ver
# 				Access denied for user 'root'@'' (Using password: YES')
#
# 			If you try to connect as root and get hte following error, it means that you do not have a row in the user table with a User column value
# 			of 'root' and that mysqld cannot reoslve the host name for your client:
#
# 				Access denied for user ''@'unknown'
#
# 			These errors indicate a DNS problem. To fix it, execute mysqladmin flush-hosts to reset the internal DNS host cache.
#
# 			Some solutions are:
#
# 			 )	Determine what is wrong with your DNs and fix it
# 
#  		 ) Specify IP addresses rather than host names in the MySQL grant tables
#
# 			 ) Put an entry for the client machine name in /etc/hosts on Unix or \windows\hosts on Windows
#
# 			 ) start mysqld with the --skip-name-resolve option
#
# 			 ) start mysqld with the --skip-host-cache option
#
# 			 ) On Unix, if you are running the server and the client on teh same machine, connect to localhost.
# 				For connections to localhost, MySQL programs attempt to connect to the local server by using a 
# 				Unix socket file, unless there are connection params specified to ensure that hte client makes a 
# 				TCP/IP connection.
#
# 			 ) On WIndows,if you are running the server and the client on teh same machine and the server supports named pipe connections,
# 				connect to the host name (period). Connections to . use a pipe rather than TCP/IP
#
# 		) if mysql -u root works but mysql -h your_hostname -u root results in Access denied (where your_hostname is the actual host name of the local host),
# 				you may not have the correct name for your host in the user table.
#
# 			A common problem here is that the Host value in teh user table row specifies an unqualified host name, but your systems name resolution
# 			routines return a fully qualified domain name (or vice versa).
#
# 			For example, if you have a row with host 'pluto' in the user table, but your DNS tells MySQL that your host name is 'pluto.example.com'
# 			the row won't work.
#
# 			Try adding a row to the user table that contains the IP address of your host as the Host column value. (alternatively, you could add a row to the
# 			user table with a Host value that contains a wildcard; for example, 'pluto.%'.
#
# 			However, use of Host values ending with % is insecure and not recommended.)
#
# 		) If mysql -u <user_name> works but mysql -u <user_name> <some_db> does not, you have not granted access to the given user for the database named
# 			<some_db>.
#
# 		) if mysql -u <user_name> works when executed on teh server host, but mysql -h <host_name> -u <user_name> does not work when executed on a remote client,
# 			you have not enabled access to the server for the given user name from the remote host.
#
# 		) If you cannot figure out why you get Access denied, remove from the user table all rows that have Host values containing wildcards (rows that contain '%' or '_'
# 			characters)
#
# 			a very common error is to insert a new row with Host='%' and User='some_user', thinking that this enables you to specify localhost to connect
# 			from the same machine.
#
# 			The reason that this does not work is that hte default privs include a row with Host='localhost' and User=''.
#
# 			Because that row has a Host value 'localhost' that is more specific than '%', it is used in preference to the new row when connecting
# 			from localhost.			
#
# 			The correct procedure is to insert a second row with Host='localhost' and User='some_user', or to delete the row with Host='localhost' and User=''.
# 			After deleting the row, remember to issue a FLUSH PRIVILEGES statement to reload the grant tables.
#
# 		) If you are able to connect to the MySQL server, but get an Access denied message whenever you issue a SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE or LOAD_DATA_INFILE
# 			statement, your row in the user table does not have the FILE priv enabled.
#
# 		) If you change the grant tables directly (for example, by using INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements) and your changes seem to be ignored,
# 			remember that you must execute a FLUSH_PRIVILEGES statement or a mysqladmin flush-privileges command to cause the server to reload
# 			the privilege tables.
#
# 			Otherwise, your changes have no effect until the enxt time the server is restarted.
#
# 			Remember that after you change the root PW with an UPDATE statement, you will not need to specify the new PW until after
# 			you flush the privs, because the server will not know you've changed the PW yet.
#
# 		) If your privs seem to have changed in the middle of a session, it may be that a MySQL admin has changed them.
#
# 			Reloading the grant table affects new client connections, but it also affects existing connections as indicated since before.
#
# 		) If you have access problems with a Perl, PHP, Python or ODBC program, try to connect to the server with mysql -u user_name db_name
# 			or mysql -u user_name -p<your_pw_here> <db_name>
#
# 			If you are able to connect using the mysql client, the problem lies with your program, not with the access privs.
#
# 			(There is no space between -p and the PW. You can also use the --password=<your_pass> syntax to specify the PW)
#
# 			if you use the -p or --password option with no PW value, MySQL prompts you for the PW.
#
# 		) For testing purposes, start hte mysqld server with the --skip-grant-tables option.
#
# 			Then you can change the MySQL grant tables and use the SHOW_GRANTS statement to check whether your modifications
# 			have the desired effect.
#
# 			When you are satisfied with your changes, execute mysqladmin flush-privileges to tell the mysqld server to load
# 			the privs again.
#
# 			This enables you to begin using the new grant table contents without stopping and restarting the server.
#
# 		) If everything else fails, start the mysqld server with a debugging option (for example, --debug=d,general,query)
#
# 		This prints host and user information about attempted connections, as well as information about each command issued.
#
# 		) If you have any other problems with the MySQL grant table and feel you must post the problem to the mailing list, always provide a dump of the
# 			MySQL grant tables.
#
# 			You can dump the tables with the mysqldump mysql command.
#
# 			To file a bug report, see earlier.
#
# 			In some cases, you may need to restart mysqld with --skip-grant-tables to run mysqldump.
#
# MYSQL USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
#
# This section describes how to set up accounts for clients of your MySQL server. It discusses the following topics:
#
# 		) The meaning of account names and PWs as used in MySQL and how that compares to names and PWs used by your OS
#
# 		) How to set up new accounts and remove existing accounts
#
# 		) How to use roles, which are named collections of privs
#
# 		) How to change PWs
#
# 		) Guidelines for using PWs securly
#
# USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS
#
# MySQL stores accounts in the user table of the mysql system database.
#
# An account is defined in terms of a user name and the client host or hosts from which the user can connect to the server.
#
# The account may also have a PW. MySQL supports authentication plugins, so it is possible that an account authenticates using
# some external authentication method.
#
# There are several distinctions between the way user names and PWs are used by MySQL and your OS:
#
# 		) USer names, as used by MySQL for authentication purposes, have nothing to do with user names (login names) as used by Your OS.
#
# 			On Unix, most mySQL clients by default try to log in using the current Unix user name as the MySQL user name, but that's only for convenience.
#
# 			The default can be overridden easily, because client programs permit any user name to be specified with a -u or --user option:
#
# 			This means that anyone can attempt to connect to the server using any user name, so you cannot make a DB secure in any way unless all MySQL
# 			accounts have passwords.
#
# 			Anyone who specifies a user name for an account that has no password is able to connect succesfully to the server.
#
# 		) MySQL user names can eb up to 32 chars long. OS users may be of a different max length. For example, Unix user names typically are 
# 			limited to 8 chars.
#
# 			WARNING:
#
# 				The limit on MySQL user name length is hardcoded in MySQL servers and clients, and trying to circumvent it by modifying the defs of teh table
# 				in teh mysql db does not work.
#
# 				You should never alter the structure of tables in the mysql db in any manner whatsoever except means of the procedure that is
# 				described in upgrading.
#
# 				Attempting ot redefine MySQL's System tables in any other fashion results in undefined (and unsupported) behavior.
#
# 				The server is free to ignore rows that become malformed as a result of such modifications.
#
# 		) To authenticate client connections for accounts that use MySQL native authentication (implemented by the mysql_native_password authentication plugin),
# 			the server uses passwords stored in the user table.
#
# 			These passwords are distinct from passwords for logging in to your OS.
#
# 			There is no necessary connection between the "external" PW you use to log in to a Windows or Unix machine and the PW you use to access the MysQL server
# 			on that machine.
#
# 			If the server authenticates a client using some other plugin, the authentication method that the plugin implements may or may not use a PW stored in the user
# 			table. IN this case, it is possible that an external PW is also used to authenticate to the MySQL server.
#
# 		) Password stored in the user table are encrypted using plugin-specific algorithms.
#
# 		) If the user name and PW contain only ASCII chars, it is possible to connect ot hte server regardless of character setting.
#
# 			To connet when the user name or PW contain non-ascii chars, the client should call the mysql_options() C API function with the
# 			MYSQL_SET_CHARSET_NAME option and appropaite charatet set name as arguments.
#
# 			This casues authentication to take place using the specified character set:
#
# 			Otehrwise, authentication will fail unless the server default character set is the same as the encoding in teh authentication defaults.
#
# 			Standard MySQL client programs support a --default-character-set option that causes mysql_options to be called as just described.
# 			iN addition, the character set autodetection is supported as described later.
#
# 			For programs that use a connector that is not based on the C API, the connector may provide an equivalent ot mysql_options() that can be used instead.
#
# 			The preceding notes do not apply to ucs2, utf16 and utf32, which are not permitted as client char sets.
#
# The MySQL installation process populates the grant tables with an initial root account,  as described earlier.
#
# Thereafter, you normally set up, modify and remove MYSQL accounts using statements such as CREATE_USER, DROP_USER, GRANT, and REVOKE.
#
# To connect to a MySQL server with a command-line script client, specify user name and password options as necessary for the account that you want to use:
#
# 		mysql --user=finley --password db_name
#
# If you prefer short options, the command looks like this:
#
# 		mysql -u finley -p db_name
#
# If you omit the PW value following the --password or -p option on the command line (as just shown),
# the client prompts for one.
#
# Alternatively, the password can be specified on the cmd line:
#
# 		mysql --user=finley --password=password db_name
# 		mysql -u finley -ppassword db_name
#
# If you use the -p option, there must be no space between -p and the PW that follows.
#
# Specifying a PW on the cmd line should be considered insecure.
#
# Use an option file or a login path file instead for the PW decalration.
#
# ADDING USER ACCOUNTS
#
# To create MySQL accounts, use the account-management statements intended for creating accounts and establishing their privs, such as
# CREATE_USER and GRANT.
#
# These statements cause the server to make appropiate modifications to the underlying grant tables.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Direct modification of grant tables using statements such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE is discouraged and done at your own risk.
#
# 		The server is free to ignore rows that become malform as a result of such modifications.
#
# 		For any operation that modifies a grant table, the server checks whether the table has the expected structure and produces an
# 		error if not. 
#
# 		mysql_upgrade must be run to update the tables to the expected structure.
#
# Another option for creating accounts is to use the GUI tool MySQL workbench.
#
# The following showcases how to use the mysql client program to set up new accounts.
#
# These examples assume that privileges have been set up according to the defualts described earlier.
#
# This means that to make changes, you must connect to the MySQL server as the MySQL root user, which has the CREATE_USER privs.
#
# First, use the mysql program to connect to the server as the MySQL root user:
#
# 		mysql --user=root mysql
#
# If you have assigned a password to the root account, you must also supply a -password or -p option.
#
# After connecting to the server as root, you can add new accounts. The following example uses CREATE_USER and GRANT statements to set up
# four accounts:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'finley'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# 		GRANT ALL PRIVLEGES ON *.* TO 'finley'@'localhost'
# 			-> 	WITH GRANT OPTION;
# 		CREATE USER 'finley'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# 		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'finley'@'%'
# 			-> 	WITH GRANT OPTION;
# 		CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# 		GRANT RELOAD PROCESS ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';
# 		CREATE USER 'dummy'@'localhost';
#
# The accounts created by said statements have the following properties:
#
# 		) Two accounts have a user name of finley. Both are superusers accounts that have full privileges to do anything.
#
# 			The 'finley'@'localhost' account can be used only when connecting from the local host. 
#
# 			The 'finley'@'%' account uses the '%' wildcard for the host part, so it can be used to connect from any host.
#
# 			The 'finley'@'localhost' account is necessary if there is an anon user for localhost. Without the 'finley'@'localhost',
# 			that anon user acc takes precedence when finley connects from the local host and finley is treated as an anon.
#
# 			The reason for this is that the anon user has more specific Host oclumn (see previous section), than the 'finley'@'%' acc
# 			and thus comes earlier in the user table sort order. 
#
# 		) The 'admin'@'localhost' account can be used only by admin to connect from the local host.
#
# 			It is granted the RELOAD and PROCESS administrative privs. 
#
# 			These privs enable the admin user to execute the mysqladmin reload, mysqladmin refresh, and mysqladmin flush-xxx commands, as well as
# 			mysqladmin processlist.
#
# 			No privs are granted for accessing any DBs. You could add such privs using the GRANT statements.
#
# 		) The 'dummy'@'localhost' account has no PW (which is insecure and not recommended). This account can be used only to connect
# 			from the localhost.
#
# 			No rpvis are granted. It is assumed you will grant specific privs to the acc using GRANT statements.
#
# To see the privileges for an account, use SHOW_GRANT:
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'admin'@'localhost';
# 		+-----------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for admin@localhost 			 						|
# 		+-----------------------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT RELOAD, PROCESS ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' |
# 		+-----------------------------------------------------+
#
# To see nonprivlege properties for an account, use SHOW_CREATE_USER:
#
# 		SHOW CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost'\G
# 		*************************** 1. row ************************
# 		CREATE USER for admin@localhost: CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost'
# 		IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password'
# 		AS '*<numbers/letters>'
# 		REQUIRE NONE PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK
#
# The next example create three accounts and grant them access to specific DBs.
# Each of them has a user name of custom and password of password:
#
# CREATE USER 'custom'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
# 		-> 		ON bankaccount.*
# 		-> 		TO 'custom'@'localhost';
#
# CREATE USER 'custom'@'host47.example.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
# 		-> 		ON expenses.*
# 		-> 		TO 'custom'@'host47.example.com';
#
# CREATE USER 'custom'@'%.example.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
# 		-> 		ON customer.*
# 		-> 		TO 'custom'@'%.example.com';
#
# The three accounts cna be used as follows:
#
# 		) The first account can access the bankaccount database, but only from the local host.
#
# 		) The second account can access the expenses database, but only from the host47.example.com
#
# 		) The third account can access the customer database, from any host in the example.com domain.
#
# 			This account has access from all machines in the domain due to use of the % widlcard character in the host part of the account name.
#
# REMOVING USER ACCOUNTS
#
# To remove an account, use the DROP_USER statement, which is described later in greater detail:
#
# 	 DROP USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
#
# USING ROLES
#
# A MySQL role is a named collection of privileges. Like user accounts, roles can have privileges granted to and revoked from them.
#
# A user account can be granted roles, which grants to the account the privileges associated with each role.
#
# This enables assignment of sets of privileges to accounts and provides a convenient alternative to granting individual privileges,
# both for conceptualizing desired privilege assignments and implementing them.
#
# The following list summarizes role-management capabilities provided by MySQL:
#
# 		) CREATE_ROLE and DROP_ROLE enable roles to be created and removed.
#
# 		) GRANT and REVOKE enable privilege assignment and revocation for user accounts and roles.
#
# 		) SHOW_GRANTS displays privilege and role assignments for user accounts and roles.
#
# 		) SET_DEFAULT_ROLE specifies which account roles are active by default.
#
# 		) SET_ROLE changes the active roles within the current session.
#
# 		) The CURRENT_ROLE() function displays the active roles within the current session.
#
# 		) The mandatory_roles and activate_all_roles_on_login SYS_VAR enables defining mandatory roles and automatic activation
# 			of granted roles when users log in to the server.
#
# For descriptiosn of individual role-manipulation statements, see later.
#
# The following discussion provides examples of role usage.
#
# Unless otherwise specified, SQL statements shown should be executed using a MySQl acc with admin privileges, such as the root account.
#
# CREATING ROLES AND GRANTING PRIVILEGES TO THEM
#
# Consider this scenario:
#
# 		) An application uses a database named app_db
#
# 		) Associated with the application, there can be accounts for developers who create and maintain the application, and for users who interact with it.
#
# 		) Developers need full access to the database. Some users need only read access, others need read/write access.
#
# To avoid granting privileges individually to possibly many user accounts, create roles as names for the required privilege sets.
# This makes it easy to grant the required privileges to user accounts, by granting them appropiate roles.
#
# To create hte roles, use CREATE_ROLE:
#
# 		CREATE ROLE 'app_developer', 'app_read', 'app_write';
#
# Role names are much like USER ACCS and consists of a user part and a host part in 'user_name'@'host_name' format.
#
# The host part, if omitted, defaults to '%'.
#
# The user and host parts can be unquoted unless they contain special characters such as - or %.
#
# Unlike account names, the user part of role names cannot be blank.
#
# To assign privileges to the roles, execute GRANT using the same sytnax as for assigning privileges to user accounts:
#
# 	GRANT ALL ON app_db.* TO 'app_developer';
# 	GRANT SELECT ON app_db.* TO 'app_read';
# 	GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* TO 'app_write';
#
# Now suppose that intially you require one developer account, two user accounts that need read-only access, and one user account
# that needs read/write access.
#
# Use CREATE_USER to create the accounts:
#
# 	CREATE USER 'dev1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dev1pass';
# 	CREATE USER 'read_user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'read_user1pass';
# 	CREATE USER 'read_user2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'read_user2pass';
# 	CREATE USER 'rw_user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'rw_user1pass';
#
# To assign each user its required privileges, you could use GRANT statements of the same form as just shown, but that requires
# enumerating individuals privileges for each user.
#
# Instead, use an alternative GRANT syntax that permits granting roles rather than privileges:
#
# 	GRANT 'app_developer' TO 'dev1'@'localhost';
# 	GRANT 'app_read' TO 'read_user1'@'localhost', 'read_user2'@'localhost';
# 	GRANT 'app_read', 'app_write' TO 'rw_user1'@'localhost';
#
# The GRANT statement for the rw_user1 account grans the read and write roles, which combine to provide the required read and write privileges.
#
# The GRANT syntax for granting roles to an account differs from the Syntax for granting privileges:
#
# 		There is an ON clause to assign privileges, whereas there is no ON clause to assign roles.
#
# 		Because the syntaxes are distinct, you cannot mix assigning privileges and roles in the same statement.
# 		(It is permitted to assign both privilegs and roles to an account, but you must use separate GRANT statements,
# 			each with syntax appropiate to what is to be granted)
#
# DEFINE MANDATORY ROLES
#
# It is possible to specify roles as mandatory by naming them in the value of the mandatory_roles SYS_VAR.
# The server treats a mandatory role as granted to all users, so that it need not be granted explicitly to any account.
#
# To specify mandatory roles at server startup, define mandatory_roles in your server my.cnf file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		mandatory_roles='role1,rol2@localhost,r3@%.example.com'
#
# To set and persist mandatory_roles at runtime, use a statement like this:
#
# 		SET PERSIST mandatory_roles = 'role1,role2@localhost, r3@%.example.com';
#
# SET_PERSIST sets the value for the running MySQL instance. It also saves the value to be used for subsequent server restarts.
#
# To change a value for the running MySQL instance without saving it for subsequent restarts, use the GLOBAL keyword rather than PERSIST.
#
# Setting mandatory_roles requires the ROLE_ADMIN privilege, in addition to the SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER privilege normall required
# to set a global system variable.
#
# Mandatory roles, like explicitly granted roles, do not take effect until activated. 
#
# At login time, role activation occurs for all granted roles if the activate_all_roles_on_login system variable is enabled,
# or only for roles that are set as default roles otherwise.
#
# At runtime, SET_ROLE activates roles.
#
# Roles named in the value of mandatory_roles cannot be revoked with REVOKE or dropped with DROP_ROLE or DROP_USER.
#
# If a role named in mandatory_roles is not present in the mysql.user system table, the role is not granted to users.
#
# When the server attempts role activaiton for a user, it does not treat the nonexistent role as mandatory and writes
# a warning ot the error log.
#
# If the role is created later and thus becomes valid, FLUSH_PRIVILEGES may be necessary to cause the server to treat it
# as mandatory.
#
# SHOW_GRANTS displays mandatory roles according to the rules described later.
#
# CHECKING ROLE PRIVS
#
# To verify the privs assigned to an account, use SHOW_GRANTS. For example:
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dev1'@'localhost';
# 		+--------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for dev1localhost 								|
# 		+--------------------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `dev1`@`localhost`			|
# 		| GRANT `app_developer`@`%` TO `dev1`@`localhost` 	|
# 		+--------------------------------------------------+
#
# However, that shows each granted role without "expanding" it to the privileges the role represents.
# TO show role privileges as well, add a USING clause naming the granted roles for which to display privileges:
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dev1'@'localhost' USING 'app_developer';
# 		+-----------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for dev1@localhost 											|
# 		+-----------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `dev1`@`localhost` 		            |
# 		| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `app_db`.* TO `dev1`@`localhost` 	|
# 		| GRANT `app_developer`@`%` TO `dev1`@`localhost` 			   |
# 		+-----------------------------------------------------------+
#
# Verify each other type of user similarly:
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dev1'@'localhost' USING 'app_developer';
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for read_user1@localhost 									 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `read_user1`@`localhost` 				 |
# 		| GRANT SELECT ON `app_db`.* TO `read_user1`@`localhost`	 	 |
# 		| GRANT `app_read`@`%` TO `read_user1`@`localhost` 			 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'rw_user1'@'localhost' USING 'app_read', 'app_write';
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for rw_user1@localhost 										 						 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` 					  						 |
# 		| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `app_db`.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` |
# 		| GRANT `app_read`@`%`, `app_write`@`%` TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` 				 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# SHOW_GRANTS displays mandatory roles according to the rules described later.
#
# ACTIVATING ROLES
#
# Roles granted to a user account can be active or inactive within account sessions. 
# If a granted role is active within a session, its privileges apply; otherwise, they do not.
#  
# To determine which roles are active within the current session, use the CURRENT_ROLE() function.
#
# By default, granting a role to an account or naming it in the mandatory_role SYS_VAR value does not automatically
# cause the role to become active within account sessions.
#
# For example, because thus far in the preceding discussion no rw_user1 roles have been activated, if you connect to
# the server as rw_user1 and invoke the CURRENT_ROLE() function, the result is NONE(no active roles):
#
# SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
# +------------------------+
# | CURRENT_ROLE() 			|
# +------------------------+
# | NONE 					   |
# +------------------------+
#
# To specify which roles should become active each time a user connects to the server and authenticates, use SET_DEFAULT_ROLE.
# To set the default to all assigned roles for each account created earlier, use this statement:
#
# 		SET DEFAULT ROLE ALL TO 'dev1'@'localhost', 'read_user1'@'localhost', 'read_user2'@'localhost', 'rw_user1'@'localhost';
#
# Now if you connect as rw_user1, the initial value of CURRENT_ROLE() reflects the new default role assignments:
#
# SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
# +-------------------------------+
# | CURRENT_ROLE() 			 		 |
# +-------------------------------+
# | `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%`|
# +-------------------------------+
#
# To cause all explicitly granted and mandatory roles to be automatically activated when users connect to the server,
# enable the activate_all_roles_on_login SYS_VAR.
#
# By default, automatic role activation is disabled.
#
# Within a session, a user can execute SET_ROLE to change the set of active roles. For example, for rw_user1:
#
# 	SET ROLE NONE; SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
# +---------------------+
# | CURRENT_ROLE() 		|
# +---------------------+
# | NONE 					|
# +---------------------+
#
#  SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT 'app_write'; SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
# +---------------------+
# | CURRENT_ROLE() 		|
# +---------------------+
# | `app_read`@`%` 		|
# +---------------------+
#
# SET ROLE DEFAULT; SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
# +-------------------------------+
# | CURRENT_ROLE() 					 |
# +-------------------------------+
# | `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%`|
# +-------------------------------+
#
# The first SET_ROLE statement deactives all roles.
# The second makes rw_user1 effectively read only.
#
# The third restores the defualt roles.
#
# The effective user for stored program and view objects is subject to the DEFINER and SQL SECURITY attributes, which
# whether execution occurs in invoker or definer context (covered later):
#
# 		) Stored program and view objects that execute in invoker context execute with the active roles within the current session.
#
# 		) Stored program and view objects that execute in definer context execute with the default roles of the user named in their DEFINER attribute.
#
# 			If activate_all_roles_on_login is enabled, such objects execute with all roles granted to the DEFINER user, including mandatory roles.
# 
# 			For stored programs, if execution should occur with roles different from the default, the program body should execute SET_ROLE to activate the required roles.
# 
# REVOKING ROLES OR ROLE PRIVILEGES
#
# Just as roles can be granted to an account, they can be revoked from an account:
#
# 		REVOKE role FROM user;
#
# Roles named in the mandatory_roles SYS_VAR value cannot be revoked.
#
# REVOKE can also be applied to a role to modify the privileges granted to it.
# This affects not only the role itself, but any account granted that role.
#
# Suppose that you want to temporarily make all application users read only.
#
# To do this, use REVOKE to revoke the modification privileges from the app_write role:
#
# 		REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* FROM 'app_write';
#
# As it happens,that leaves the role with no privleges at all, as can be seen using SHOW_GRANTS (which demonstrates that this statement can be used with roles, not just users):
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'app_write';
# 		+--------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for app_write@% 			  		|
# 		+--------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `app_write`@`%`|
# 		+--------------------------------------+
#
# Because revoking privileges from a role affects the privileges for any user who is assigned the modified role, rw_user1 now has no table modification
# privileges (INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are no longer present):
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'rw_user1'@'localhost' USING 'app_read', 'app_write';
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for rw_user1@localhost 												  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` 							  |
# 		| GRANT SELECT ON `app_db`.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost`				  |
# 		| GRANT `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%` TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` 	  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# In effect, the rw_user1 read/write user has become a read-only user. 
#
# This also occurs for any other accounts that are granted the app_write role, illustrating how use of roles makes it unecessary to modify privileges for individual accounts.
#
# To restore modification privileges to the role, simply re-grant them:
#
# 		GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* TO 'app_write';
#
# Now rw_user1 again has modification privs, as do any other accounts granted the app_write role.
#
# REMOVING ROLES
#
# To remove roles, use DROP_ROLE:
#
# 		DROP ROLE 'app_read', 'app_write';
#
# Dropping a role revokes it from every account to which it was granted.
#
# Roles named in the mandatory_roles system variable cannot be dropped.
#
# USER AND ROLE INTERCHANGEABILITY
#
# As has been hinted at earlier for SHOW_GRANTS, which displays grants for user accounts or roles, accounts and roles can be used
# interchangably.
#
# You can treat a user account like a role and grant that account to another user or a role.
#
# The effect is to grant the account's privileges and roles to the other user or role.
#
# This set of statements demonstrates that you can grant a user to a user, a role to a user, a user to a role, or a role to a role:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'u1';
# 		CREATE ROLE 'r1';
#
# 		GRANT SELECT ON db1.* TO 'u1';
# 		GRANT SELECT ON db2.* TO 'r1';
#
# 		CREATE USER 'u2';
# 		CREATE ROLE 'r2';
# 
# 		GRANT 'u1', 'r1' TO 'u2';
# 		GRANT 'u1', 'r1' TO 'r2';
#
# The result in each case is to grant to the grantee object the privileges associated with the granted object.
#
# After executing those statements, each of u2 and r2 have been granted privs from a user (u1) and a role (r1):
#
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'u2' USING 'u1', 'r1';
# 		+------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for u2@% 						 |
# 		+------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u2`@`%` 	 |
# 		| GRANT SELECT ON `db1`.* TO `u2`@`%`|
# 		| GRANT SELECT ON `db2`.* TO `u2`@`%`|
# 		| GRANT `u1`@`%`,`r1`@`%` TO `u2`@`%`|
# 		+------------------------------------+
#
# 		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'r2' USING 'u1', 'r1';
# 		+------------------------------------+
# 		| Grants for r2@% 						 |
# 		+------------------------------------+
# 		| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `r2`@`%` 	 |
# 		| GRANT SELECT ON `db1`.* TO `r2`@`%`|
# 		| GRANT SELECT ON `db2`.* TO `r2`@`%`|
# 		| GRANT `u1`@`%`,`r1`@`%` TO `r2`@`%`|
# 		+------------------------------------+
#
# The preceding example is llustrative only, but interchangability of user accounts and roles has practical application;
# such as in the following situation:
#
# 	Suppose that a legacy application development project began before the advent of roles in MySQL, so all user accounts
#  associated with the project are granted privileges directly (rather than granted privileges by virtue of being granted roles).
#
#  One of these accounts is a dev account taht was originally granted privs as follows:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'old_app_devpass';
# 		GRANT ALL ON old_app.* TO 'old_app_dev'@'localhost';
#
# If this developer leaves the project, it becomes nesesecary to assign the privileges to anotehr user, or perhaps multiple users
# if devleopment activities have expanded.
#
# Here are some ways to deal with the issue:
#
# 		) Without using roles : Change the account PW so the original dev cannot use it, and have a new dev use it instead:
#
# 				ALTER USER 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
#
# 		) Using roles: Lock the acc to prevent anyone from using it to connect to the server:
#
# 				ALTER USER 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' ACCOUNT LOCK;
#
# 			Then treat the account as a role. For each dev new to the project, create a new account and grant it to the original dev acc:
#
# 				CREATE USER 'new_app_dev1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
# 				GRANT 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' TO 'new_app_dev1'@'localhost';
#
# 			The effect is to assign the original dev acc privs to the new account.
#
# RESERVED USER ACCOUNTS
#
# One part of the MySQL installation process is data directory initializaiton.
#
# During data dir initialization, MySQL creates user accounts that should be considered reserved:
#
# 		) 'root'@'localhost': Used for administrative purposes. This account has all privileges and can perform any operation.
#
# 			Strictly speaking, this acc name is not reserved, in the sense that some installations rename the root account to something
# 			else to avoid exposing a highly privleged account with a well-known name.
#
# 		) 'mysql.sys'@'localhost': Used as the DEFINER for sys schema objects. Use of the mysql.sys account avoids problems that occur
# 			if a DBA renames or removes the root account.
#
# 			THis account is locked so that it cannot be used for client applications.
#
# 		) 'mysql.session'@'localhost': Used internally by plugins to access the server. This account is locked so that it cannot be used for client connections.
#
# 		) 'mysql.infoschema'@'localhost': Used as the DEFINER for INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. Use of the mysql.infoschema account avoids problems that occur if a DBA 
# 			renames or removes the root account.
#
# 			This account is locked so that it cannot be used for client connections.
#
# SETTING ACCOUNT RESOURCE LIMITS
#
# One means of restricting client use of MySQL server resources is to set the global max_user_connections SYS_VAR to a > 0 value.
#
# This limits the number of simultaneous connections that can be made by any given account, but places no limits on what a client
# can do once connected.
#
# In addition, setting max_user_connections does not enable management of individual accounts.
#
# Both types of control are of interest to MySQL admins.
#
# To address such concerns, MYSQL permits limits for individual accounts on use of these server resources:
#
# 		) The number of queries an account can issue per hour
#
# 		) The number of updates an account can issue per hour
#
# 		) The number of times an account can connect to the server per hour
#
# 		) The number of simultaneous connections to the server by an account
#
# Any statement that a client can issue counts against the query limit. Only statements that modify databases or tables count against the update limit.
#
# An "account" in this context corresponds to a row in the mysql.user table.
#
# That is, a connection is assessed against the User and Host values in the user table row that applies to the connection.
#
# For example, an account 'usera'@'%.example.com' corresponds to a row in the user table that has User and Host values of usera and
# %.example.com to permit usera to connect from any host in teh example.com domain.
#
# In this case, the server applies resource limits in this row collectively to all connections by usera from any host in the 
# example.com domain because all such connections use the same account.
#
# Before MySQL 5.0, an "account" was assessed against the actual host from which a user connects.
# The older method of accounting may be selected by starting the server with the --old-style-user-limits option.
#
# In this case, if usera connects simultaneously from host1.example.com and host2.example.com, the server applies the
# account resource limits separately to each connection.
#
# If usera connects again from host1.example.com, the server applies the limits for that connection together with the
# existing connection from that host.
#
# To establish resource limits for an account at account-creation time, use the CREATE_USER statement.
#
# To modify the limits for an existing account, use ALTER_USER.
#
# Provide a WITH clause that names each resource to be limited.
#
# The default value for each limit is zero (limitless).
#
# For example, to create a new account that can access the customer database, but only in a limited fashion, issue these statements:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'francis'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'frank'
# 				-> 	WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 20
# 				-> 		  MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 10
# 				-> 		  MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 5
# 				-> 		  MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 2;
#
# The limit types need not all be named in the WITH clause, but those named can be present in any order.
#
# The value for each per-hour limit should be an integer representing a count per hour.
#
# For MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS, the limit is an integer representing the maximum number of simultaneous connections
# by the account.
#
# If this limit is set to zero, the global max_user_connections SYS_VAR determines the number of simultaneous connections.
# If max_user_connections is also 0, there is no limit for the account.
#
# To modify limits for an existing account, use an ALTER_USER statement.
#
# The following statement changes the query limit for francis to 100:
#
# 		ALTER USER 'francis'@'localhost' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 100;
#
# The statement modifies only the limit value specified and leaves the account otehrwise unchagned.
#
# To remove a limit, set its value to zero. For example, to remove the limit on how many times per hour franis can connect,
# set:
#
# ALTER USER 'francis'@'localhost' WITH MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0;
#
# As mentioned previously, the simultaneous-connection limit for an account is determined from the MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS limit and the
# max_user_connections SYS_VAR.
#
# Suppose that the global max_user_connections value is 10 and three accounts have individual resource limits specified as follows:
#
# 		ALTER USER 'user1'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0;
# 		ALTER USER 'user2'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
# 		ALTER USER 'user3'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 20;
#
# user1 has a connection limit of 10 (the global max_user_connections value) because it has a MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS limit of 0 (i.e, falls back to Global).
# user2 and user3 has 5 and 20, respectively. (Defined value > 0, higher precedence than Global).
#
# The server stores resource limits for an account in the user table row corresponding to the account.
#
# The max_questions, max_updates and max_connections columns store the per-hour limits, and the max_user_connections column stores
# the MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS limit.
#
# Resource-use counting takes place when any account has a nonzero limit placed on its use of any of the resources.
#
# As the server runs, it counts the number of times each account uses resources.
# If an account reaches its limit on number of connections within the last hour, the server
# rejects further connections for the account until that hour is up.
#
# SImilarly, if the account reaches its limit on the number of queries or updates, the server
# rejects further queries or updates until the hour is up.
#
# In all such cases, the server issues appropriate error messages.
#
# Resource counting occurs per account, not per client.
#
# For example, if your account has a query limit of 50, you cannot increase your limit to 100 by making two
# simultaneous client connections to the serer.
#
# Queries issued on both connections are counted together.
#
# The current per-hour resource-use counts can be reset globally for all accounts, or individually for a given account:
#
# 		) To reset the current count to zero for all accounts, issue a FLUSH_USER_RESOURCES statement.
#
# 			The counts also can be reset by reloading the grant tables (for example, with a FLUSH_PRIVLEGES statement or a mysqladmin reload command)
#
# 		) The counts for an individual account can be reset to zero by setting any of its limits again. Specify a limit value equal to the value currently assigned ot the account.
#
# Per-hour counter resets do not affect the MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS limit.
#
# All counts begin at 0 when the server starts. Counts do not carry over through server restarts.
#
# For the MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS limit, an edge case can occur if the account currently has open the maximum number of connections
# permitted to it:
#
# A disconnect followed quickly by a connect can result in an error (ER_TOO_MANY_USER_CONNECTIONS or ER_USER_LIMIT_REACHED) if the server has not fully processed
# the disconnect by the time the connect occurs.
#
# When the server finishes disconnect processing, another connection will once more be permitted.
#
# ASSIGNING ACCOUNT PASSWORDS
#
# Required credentials for clients that connect to the MySQL server can include a password. This section describes how ot assign PWs for MySQL accs.
#
# MySQL stores credentials in the user table in the mysql system database.

# Operations that assign or modify passwords are permitted only to users with the CREATE_USER privilege, or,
# alternatively, privileges for the mysql databse (INSERT privilege to create new accounts, UPDATE privilege to modify existing accounts).
#
# If the read_only SYS_VAR is enabled, use of account-modification statements such as CREATE_USER or ALTER_USER additionally requires the
# CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.
#
# The discussion here summarizes syntax only for the most common PW assignments. More covered later.
#
# MySQL uses plugins to perform client authentication; more later.
#
# IN password-assigning statements, the authentication plugin associated with an account performs any hashing required of a cleartext
# PW specified.
#
# This enables MySQL to obfuscate PWs prior to storing them in the mysql.user table.
#
# For the statements described here, MySQL automatically hashes the PWs specified.
#
# there are also 	syntaxes for CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER that permit hashed values to be specified literally.
# 
# To assign a PW when you create a new account, use CREATE_USER and include an IDENTIFIED BY clause:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#
# CREATE_USER also supports syntax for specifying the account authentication plugin.
#
# To assign or change a password for an existing account, 	use the ALTER_USER statement with an IDENTIFIED BY clause:
#
# 		ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#
# If you are not connected as an anon user, you can change your own PW without naming your own account literally:
#
# 		ALTER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#
# To change an account PW from the cmd line, use the mysqladmin command:
# 
# 		mysqladmin -u <user_name> -h <host_name> password "password"
#
# The account for which this command sets the PW is the one with a mysql.user table row that matches <user_name> in the User column
# and the client host from which you connect in teh Host column.
#
# WARNING:
#
# 		Setting a PW using mysqladmin should be considered insecure. 
#
# 		ON some systems, your PW becomes visible to System Status programs, such as ps that may be invoked by other users to display
# 		cmd lines.
#
# 		MySQL clients tpyically overwrite the cmd line PW argument with 00's during their initialization sequence.
#
# 		However, there is still a brief interval during which the value is visible.
#
# 		Also, on some systems this overwriting strategy is ineffective and the PW remains visible to ps.
# 		(SystemV Unix systems and perhaps otehrs are subject to this problem).
#
# IF you are using MySQL Replication, be aware that - currently - a a PW used by a replication slave as part of a CHANGE_MASTER_TO statement,
# is effectively limited to 32 chars in len.
#
# If the pw is longer, any excess chars are truncated.
#
# This is not due to any limit imposed by the MySQL Server generally, but rather is an issue specific to MySQL Replication.
# (Bug #43439)
#
# PASSWORD MANAGEMENT
#
# MySQL supports these PW management capabilities:
#
# 	) PW expiration, to require PWs to be changed periodically.
#
# 	) PW reuse restrictions, to prevent old PWs from being chosen again
#
# 	) PW verification, to require that PW changes also specify the current PW to be replaced.
#
# 	) PW strength assesment, to require strong PWs.
#
# The following sections these capabilities, except PW strength assesment, which is implemented using the validate_password plugin
# and is described later.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# 		MySQL implements PW management capabilities using tables in the mysql System database.
#
# 		If you upgrade MySQL from an earlier version, your system tables might not be up to date.
# 		In that case, the server writes messages similar to these to the error log during the startup process:
#
# 			[ERROR] Column count of mysql.user is wrong. Expected 49, found 47.
# 			The table is probably corrupted.
# 			[Warning] ACL table mysql.password_history missing.
# 			Some operations may fail.
#
# 		To correct the issue, run mysql_upgrade and restart the server. Until this is done, password changes are not possible.
#
# Note:
#
# 		The password-management capabilities described here apply only to accounts that store credentials internally in the 
# 		mysql.user system table (mysql_native_password, sha256_password or caching_sha2_password)
#
# 		For accounts that use plugins that perform authentication against an external credential system, PW management must be
# 		handled externally against that system as well.
#
# PASSWORD EXPIRATION POLICY
#
# MySQL enables database admins to expire account passwords manually, and to establish a policy for automatic PW expiration.
#
# Expiration policy can be established globally, and individual accounts can be set to either defer to the global policy
# or override the global policy with specific per-account behavior.  
#
# To expire an account password manually, use the ALTER_USER statement:
#
# 		ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE;
#
# This operation marks the PW expired in the corresponding mysql.user table row.
#
# Password expiration according to policy is automatic and is based on password age, which for a given
# account is assessed from the date and time of its most recent password change.
#
# The mysql.user table indicates for each account when its password was last changed, and the server
# automatically treats the pw as expired at client connection time if its age is greater than its
# permitted lifetime.
#
# This works with no explicit manual PW expiration.
#
# To establish automatic pw-expiration policy globally, use the default_password_lifetime system variable.
# Its default value is 0, which disables automatic password expiration.
#
# If the value of default_password_lifetime is a positive integer N, it indicates the permitted password
# lifetime, such that passwords must be changed every N days.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		) To establish a global policy that PWs have a lifetime of approx 6 months, start the server with these lines
# 			in a server my.cnf file:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				default_password_lifetime=180
#
# 		) To establish a global policy such that PWs never expire, set default_password_lifetime to 0:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				default_password_lifetime=0
#
# 		) default_password_lifetime can also be set and persisted at runtime:
#
# 				SET PERSIST default_password_lifetime = 180;
# 				SET PERSIST default_password_lifetime = 0;
#
# 			SET_PERSIST sets the value for the running MySQL instance.
#
# 			It also saves the value to be used for subsequent server restarts. More later on that.
#
# 			To change a value for the running MySQL instance without saving it for subsequent restarts, just use GLOBAL instead of PERSIST.
#
# The global password-expiration policy applies to all accounts that have not been set to override it.
#
# To establish policy for individual accounts, use the PASSWORD EXPIRE option of the CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER statements.
#
# Example account-specific statements:
#
# 		) Require the password to be changed every 90 days:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 90 DAY;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 90 DAY;
#
# 			This expiration option overrides the global policy for all accounts named by the statement.
#
# 		) Disable password expiration:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER;
#
# 			This expiration option overrides the global policy for all accounts named by the statement.
#
# 		) Defer to the global expiration policy for all accounts named by the statement:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT;
#
# When a client successfully connects, the server determines whether the account password has expired:
#
# 		) The server checks whether the password has been manually expired.
#
# 		) Otherwise, the server checks whether the password age is greater than its permitted lifetime according to the
# 			automatic password expiration policy.
#
# 			If so, the server considers the password expired.
#
# If the password is expired (whether manually or automatically), the server either disconnects the client or restricts the
# operations permitted to it.
#
# Operations performed by a restricted client result in an error until the user establishes a new account password:
#
# 		SELECT 1;
# 		ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER statement before executing this statement.
#
# 		ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
#
# 		SELECT 1;
# 		+---+
# 		| 1 |
# 		+---+
# 		| 1 |
# 		+---+
# 		1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#
# After the client resets the password, the server restores normal access for the session, as well as for
# subsequent connections that use the account.
#
# It is also possible for an administrative user to reset the account password, but any existing restricted sessions
# for that account remain restricted.
#
# A client using the account must disconnect and reconnect before statements can be executed successfully.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		It is possible to "reset" a password by setting it to its current value. As a matter of good policy, it is preferable to choose a different PW.
# 		DBAs can enforce non-reuse by establishing an appropiate password-reuse policy.
#
# PASSWORD REUSE POLICY
#
# MySQL enables restrictions to be placed on reuse of previous passwords.
# Reuse restrictions can be established based on number of password changes, time elapsed or
# both.
#
# Reuse policy can be established globally, and individual accounts can be set to either defer to the global
# policy or override the global policy with specific per-account behavior.
#
# The password history for an account consists of passwords it has been assigned in the past.
# MySQL can restrict new passwords from being chosen from this history:
#
# 		) If an account is restricted on the basis of number of password changes, a new password cannot be chosen from a specific number of
# 			the most recent passwords.
#
# 			For example, if the minimum number of password changes is set to 3, a new password cannot be the same as any of the most recent 3 PWs.
#
# 		) If an account is restricted based on time elapsed, a new PW cannot be chosen from PWs in the history that are newer than a specified
# 			number of days.
#
# 			For example, if the PW reuse interval is set to 60, a new PW must not be among those previously chosen within the last 60 days.
#
# 			NOTE: The empty password does not count in the password history and is subject to reuse at any time.
#
# To establish password-reuse policy globally, use the password_history and password_reuse_interval SYS_VARs.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		) To prohibit reusing any of the last 6 passwords or passwords newer than 365 days, put these lines in the server my.cnf file:
#
# 			[mysqld]
# 			password_history=6
# 			password_reuse_interval=365
#
# 		) To set and persist the variables at runtime, use statements like this:
#
# 			SET PERSIST password_history = 6;
# 			SET PERSIST password_reuse_interval = 365;
#
# SET_PERSIST sets the value for the running MySQL instance. It also saves the value to be used for subsequent server restarts.
# More on that later.
#
# To change a value for the running MySQL instance without saving it for subsequent restarts, use the GLOBAL keyword rather than PERSIST.
#
# The global password-reuse policy applies to all accounts that have not been set to override it.
#
# To establish policy for individual accounts, use the PASSWORD HISTORY and PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL options
# of the CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER statements. More on that later.
#
# Example account-specific statements:
#
# 		) Require a minimum of 5 password changes before permitting reuse:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD HISTORY 5;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD HISTORY 5;
#
# 			This history-length option overrides the global policy for all accounts named by the statemnet.
#
# 		) Require a minimum of 365 days elapsed before permitting reuse:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
#
# 			This time-elapsed option overrides the global policy for all accounts named by the statement.
#
# 		) To combine both types of reuse restrictions, use PASSWORD HISTORY and PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL together:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
# 				PASSWORD HISTORY 5
# 				PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
# 
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
# 				PASSWORD HISTORY 5
# 				PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
#
# 			These options override both global policy reuse restrictions for all accounts named by the statement.
#
# 		) Defer to the global policy for both types of reuse restrictions:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
# 				PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT
# 				PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
# 				PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT
# 				PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT;
#
# PASSWORD VERIFICATION-REQUIRED POLICY
#
# As of MySQL 8.0.13, it is possible to require that attempts to change an account PW be verified by specifying the current
# PW to be replaced.
#
# This enables DBAs to prevent users from changing a password without proving that they know the current PW.
#
# Such changes could otherwise occur, for example, if one user walks away from a terminal session temporarily without logging out,
# and someone uses the session to change the original user's MySQL PW.
#
# This can cause things like:
#
# ) The original user becoming unable to access MySQL, until PW reset by a admin
#
# ) Until the PW reset occurs, the malicious user can access MySQL with the benign user's changed credentials.
#
# PW-verification policy can be established globally, and individual accounts can be set to either defer to the global policy
# or override the global policy with specific per-account behavior.
#
# For each account, its mysql.user row indicates whether there is an account-specific setting requiring verification of
# the current PW for PW change attempts.
#
# The setting is established by the PASSWORD REQUIRE option of the CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER statements:
#
# 		) If the account setting is PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT, PW changes must specify the current PW.
#
# 		) If the account setting is PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL, password changes may but need not specify the current PW
#
# 		) If the account setting is PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT, the password_require_current SYSTEM_VARIABLE determines the verification-required policy
# 			for the account:
#
# 				) If password_require_current is enabled, password changes must specify the current password.
#
# 				) If password_require_current is disabled, password changes may but need not specify the current PW.
#
# IN other words, if the account setting is not PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT, the account setting takes precedence over the
# global policy established by the password_require_current SYS_VAR.
#
# Otherwise, the account defers to the password_require_current setting.
#
# By default, PW verification is optional: password_require_current is disabled and accounts created with no PASSWORD REQUIRE
# option default to PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT.
#
# The following table shows how per-account settings interact with password_require_current SYS_VAR values to
# determine account password verification-required policy.
#
# PER-ACCOUNT SETTING 				password_require_current SYS_VAR 		Password Changes Require Current PW?
#
# PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT 		OFF 												Yes
#
# PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT 		ON 												Yes
#
# PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPT.	OFF 												No
#
# PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPT. 	ON 												No
#
# PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEF. 	OFF 												No
#
# PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEF. 	ON 												Yes
#
# Note:
#
# 		Privleged users can change any account password without specifying the current password, regardless of the verification-required
# 		policy.
#
# 		A privileged user is one who has the global CREATE_USER privlege or the UPDATE privilege for the mysql system database.
#
# To establish PW-verification policy globally, use the password_require_current SYS_VAR.
#
# Its default value is OFF, so it is not required that account password changes specify the current password.
#
# Examples:
#
# 	) To establish a global policy that PW changes must specify the current PW, start the server with these lines in the server my.cnf file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		password_require_current=ON
#
# 	) To set and persist password_require_current at runtime, use a statement such as one of these:
#
# 		SET PERSIST password_require_current = ON;
# 		SET PERSIST password_require_current = OFF;
#
# SET_PERSIST sets the value for the running MySQL instance.
#
# It also saves the value to be used for subsequent server restarts. More on that later.
#
# To change a value for the running MySQL instance without saving it for subsequent restarts, use the GLOBAL keyword rather than PERSIST.
#
# The global PW verification-required policy applies to all accounts that have not been set to override it.
# To establish policy for individual accounts, use the PASSWORD REQUIRE options of the CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER statements. More on this later.
#
# Example account-specific statements:
#
# 		) Require that password changes specify the current password:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT;
#
# 			This verification option overrides the global policy for all accounts named by the statemnt.
#
# 		) Do not require that password changes specify the current password (the current PW may but need not be given):
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL;
#
# 			This verification option overrides the global policy for all accounts named by the statement.
#
# 		) Defer to the global PW verification-required policy for all accounts named by the statement:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT;
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT;
#
# Verification of the current password comes into play when a user changes a password using the ALTER_USER or SET_PASSWORD statement.
# The examples use ALTER_USER, which is preferred óver SET_PASSWORD, but the principles described here are the same for both statements.
#
# In PW-change statements, a REPLACE clause specifies the current password to be replaced.
# Examples:
#
# 	) Change the current user's password:
#
# 			ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string' REPLACE 'current_auth_string';
#
# 	) Change a named user's password:
#
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string' REPLACE 'current_auth_string';
#
# 	) Change a named user's auth plugin and PW:
#
# 			ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'auth_string' REPLACE 'current_auth_string';
#
# The REPLACE clause works like this:
#
# 	) REPLACE must be given if PW changes for the account are required to specify the current password, as verification that the user attempting to make
# 		the change actually knows the current password.
#
# 	) REPLACE is optional if PW changes for the account may but need not specify the current PW.
#
# 	) If REPLACE is specified, it must specify the correct current password, or an error occurs. This is true even if REPLACE is optional.
#
# 	) REPLACE can be specified only when changing the account password for the current user. (This means that in the examples just shown, the statements
# 		that explicitly name the account for jeffrey fail unless the current user is jeffrey).
#
# 		This is true even if the change is attempted for another user by a privileged user.
#
# 		However, if you have the privs for it, you can do such a change without REPLACE.
#
# 	) REPLACE is omitted from the binary log to avoid writing cleartext PWs to it.
#
# SERVER HANDLING OF EXPIRED PWs
#
# MySQL provides password-expiration capability, which enables database administration to require that users reset their password.
# Passwords can be expired manually, and on the basis of a policy for automatic expiration.
#
# For each connection that uses an account with an expired password, the server either disconnects the client or restricts the client
# to "sandbox mode", in which the server permits to the client only those operations necessary to reset the expired password.
#
# Which action is taken by the server depends on both client and server settings, as discussed later.
#
# If the server disconnects the client, it returns an ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD_LOGIN error:
#
# 	mysql -u myuser -p
# 	Password: ********
# 	ERROR 1862 (HY000): Your password has expired. to log in you must change it using a client that supports expired PWs.
#
# If the server restricts the client to sandbox mode, these operations are permitted within the client session:
#
# 		) The client can reset the account password with ALTER_USER or SET_PASSWORD.
# 			After the password has been reset, the server restores normal access for the session, as well as for subsequent connections that use the account.
#
# 			It is possible to "reset" a password by setting it to its current value.
# 			As a matter of good policy, it is preferable to chose a different password.
#
# 			DBAs can enforce non-reuse by establishing an appropriate PW reuse policy.
#
# 		) The client can use SET statements.
#
# For any operation not permitted within the session, the server returns an ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD error:
#
# 		USE performance_schema;
# 		ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your PW using ALTER USER statement before executing this statement.
#
# 		SELECT 1;
# 		ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER statement before executing this statement.
#
# That is what normally happens for interactive invocations of the mysql client because by default such invocations are put in sandbox mode.
# To clear the error and resume normal functioning, select a new PW.
#
# For noninteractive invocations of the mysql client (for example, in batch mode) - the server normally disconnects the client if the PW is expired.
#
# To permit noninteractive mysql invocations to stay connected so that the PW can be changed (using the statements just described) - add the --connect-expired-password
# option to the mysql command.
#
# As mentioned previously, whether the server disconnects an expired-password client or restricts it to sandbox mode depends on a combination
# of client and server settings.
#
# The following discussion describes the relevant settings and how they interact.
#
# the discussion applies only for accounts with expired PWs. If a client connects using a nonexpired PW, the server handles the client normally.
# 
# On the client side, a given client indicates whether it can handle sandbox mode for expired passwords.
# For clients that use the C client library, there are two ways to do this:
#
# 		) Pass the MYSQL_OPT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS flag to mysql_options() prior to connecting:
#
# 			arg = 1;
# 			result = mysql_options(mysql, MYSQL_OPT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS, &arg);
#
# 			The mysql client enables MYSQL_OPT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS if invoked interactively or the --connect-expired-password option is given.
#
# 		) Pass the CLIENT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS flag to mysql_real_connect() at connection time:
#
# 			mysql = mysql_real_connect(mysql, host, user, password, db, port, unix_socket, CLIENT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS);
#
# Other MySQL Connectors have their own conventions for indicating readiness to handle sandbox mode.
#
# See respective documentation for respective connector.
#
# On the server side, if a client indicates that it can handle expired passwords, the server puts it in sandbox mode.
#
# If a client does not indicate that it can handle expired passwords (or use an older version of the client library that cannot so indicate)
# The server action depends on the value of the disconnect_on_expired_password SYS_VAR:
#
# 		) If disconnect_on_expired_password is enabled (the default), the server disconnects the client with an ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD_LOGIN error.
#
# 		) If disconnect_on_expired_password is disabled, the server puts the client in sandbox mode.
#
# PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# When a client connects to the MySQL server, the server uses the user name provided by the client and the client host to select
# the appropriate account row from the mysql.user system table.
#
# The server then authenticates the client, determining from the account row which authentication plugin applies to the client:
#
# 		) If the server cannot find the plugin, an error occurs and the connection attempt is rejected.
#
# 		) Otherwise, the server invokes that plugin to authenticate the user, and the plugin returns a status to the server indicating
# 			whether the user provided the correct password and is permitted to connect.
#
# Pluggable authentication enables these important capabilities:
#
# 		) Choice of authentication methods. Pluggable authentication makes it easy for DBAs to choose and change the authentication method
# 			using for individual MySQL accounts.
# 
# 		) External authentication. Pluggable authentication makes it possible for clients to connect to the MySQL server with credentials appropriate
# 			for authentication methods that store credentials elsewhere than in the mysql.user system table.
#
# 			For example, plugins can be created to use external authentication methods such as PAM, Windows login IDs, LDAP or Kerberos.
#
# 		) Proxy users: If a user is permitted to connect, an authentication plugin can return to the server a user name different from the name of the
# 			connecting user, to indicate that the connecting user is a proxy for another user (the proxied user).
#
# 			While the connection lasts, the proxy user is treated, for purposes of access control, as having the privileges of the proxied user.
#
# 			In effect, one user impersonates another.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				If you start the server with the --skip-grant-tables option, authentication plugins are not used even if loaded because the server performs
# 				no client authentication and permits any client to connect.
#
# 				Because this is insecure, if the server is started with the --skip-grant-tables option, it enables --skip-networking automatically to prevent
# 				remote connections.
#
# AVAILABLE AUTHENTICATION PLUGINS
#
# MySQL 8.0 provides these authentication plugins:
#
# 		) A plugin that performs native authentication. That is , authentication based on the PW hashing method in use from before the introduction of
# 			pluggable authentication in MySQL.
#
# 			The mysql_native_password plugin implements authentication based on this native password hashing method.
#
# 		) Plugins that perform authentication using SHA-256 password hashing.
#
# 			This is stronger encryption than available with native authentication.
#
# 		) A client-side plugin that sends the password to the server without hasing or encryption. This plugin is used in conjunction with
# 			server-side plugins that require access to the password exactly as provided by the client user.
#
# 		) A plugin thaht performs external authentication using PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), enabling MySQL Server to use PAM to authenticate
# 			MySQL users..
#
# 			This plugin supports proxy users as well.
#
# 		) A plugin that performs external authentication on Windows, enabling MySQL server to use native Windows services to authenticate client connections.
# 		 	USers who have logged in to Windows can connect from MySQL client programs to the server based on the information in their environment without
# 			specifying an additional PW.
#
# 			This plugin supports proxy users as well.
#
# 		) Plugins that perform authentication using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to authenticate MySQL users by accessing directory services
# 			such as X.500
#
# 			These plugins support proxy users as well.
#
# 		) A plugin that prevents all client connections to any account that uses it. Use cases for this plugin include proxied accounts that should never permit
# 			direct login but are accessed only  through proxy accounts and accounts that must be able to execute stored programs and views with elevated privileges
# 			without exposing those privileges to ordinary users.
#
# 		) A plugin that authenticates clients that connect from the local host through the Unix socket file.
#
# 		) A test plugin that  checks account credentials and logs success or failure to the server error log. This plugin is intended for testing
# 			and development purposes - as an example of how to write an authentication plugin, covered later.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		For information about current restrictions on the use of pluggable authentication, include which connectors support which plugins.
#
# 		Third-party connector developers should read that section to determine the extent to which a connector can take advantage of pluggable
# 		authentication capabilities and what steps to take to become more compliant.
#
# If you are interested in writing own authentication plugins, more later.
#
# AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN USAGE
#
# This section provides general instructions for installing and using authentication plugins.
# For instructions specific to a given plugin, see the section later.
#
# In general, pluggable authentication uses a pair of corresponding plugins on the server and client sides, so you use a given authentication method
# like this:
#
# 		) If necessary, install the plugin library or libraries containing the appropiriate plugins.
#
# 			On the server host, install the library containing the server-side plugin, so that the server can use it to authenticate
# 			client connections.
#
# 			SImilarly, on each client host, install the library containing the client-side plugin for use by client programs.
#
# 			Authentication plugins that are built in need not be installed.
#
# 		) For each MySQL account that you create, specify the appropriate server-side plugin to use for authentication. If the account
# 			is to use the default authentication plugin, the account-creation statement need not specify the plugin explicitly.
#
# 			The default_authentication_plugin SYS_VAR configures the default authentication plugin.
#
# 		) When a client connects, the server-side plugin tells the client program which client-side plugin to use for authentication.
#
# In the case that an account uses an authentication method that is the default for both the server and the client program, the server
# need not communicate to the client which client-side plugin to use, and a round trip in client/server negotiation can be avoided.
#
# For standard MySQL clients such as mysql and mysqladmin, the --default-auth=plugin_name option can be specified on the command line
# as a hint about which client-side plugin the program can expect to use, although the server will override this if the server-side plugin
# associated with the user account requires a different client-side plugin.
#
# If the client program does not find the client-side plugin library file, specify a --plugin-dir=dir_name option to indicate the plugin
# library directory location.
#
# AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN CLIENT/SERVER COMPATIBILITY
#
# Pluggable authentication enables flexibility in the choice of authentication method for MySQL accounts, but in some cases client connections
# cannot be established due to authentication plugin incompatibility between the client and server..
#
# The general compatibility principle for a successful connection to a given account on a given server is that the client and 
# server both must support the autheitcation method required by the account.
#
# Because authentication methods are implemented by authentication plugins, the client and server both must support the authentication
# plugin required by the account.
#
# Authentication plugin incompatibilities can arise in various ways. Examples:
#
# 		) Connect using a MySQL 5.7 client from 5.7.22 or lower to a MysQL 8.0 server account that authenticates with caching_sha2_password.
#
# 			This fails because the 5.7 client does not recognize the plugin, which was introduced in 8.0
#
# 			(This issue was addressed in MySQL 5.7 as of 5.7.23, when caching_sha2_password client-side support was added to the MySQL client library
# 			and client programs).
#
# 		) Connect using a MySQL 5.5 client to a MySQL 5.6 client server acc that authenticates with sha256_password.
#
# 			This fails because the 5.5. does not recognize the plugin, whic was introduced in MySQL 5.6
#
# 		) connect using a MySQL 5.7 client  from a community distrib to a MySQL 5.7 >Enterprise server account that authenticates using one of the
# 			Enterprise-only LDAP authentication plugins. This fails because the community client does not have access to said plugin.
#
# In general, these compatibility issues do not arise when connections are made between a client and server from the same MySQL distrib.
# When connections are made between a client and server from different MySQL series, issues can arise.
#
# these issues are inherent in the development process when MysQL introduces new authentication plugins or removes old ones.
# To minimize the potentional for incompatibilities, regularly update the server, clients and connectors on a timely basis.
#
# AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN CONNECTOR-WRITING CONSIDERATIONS
#
# Various implementations of the MySQL client/server protocol exist. The libmysqlclient C API client library is one implementation.
#
# Some MySQL connectors (typically those not written in C) provide their own implementation. However, not all protocol implementations
# handle plugin authentication in the same way.
#
# This section describes an authentication issue that protocl implementors should take into account.
#
# In the client/Server protocol, the server tells connecting clients which authentication plugin it considers the default.
#
# If the protocol implementation used by the client tries to load the default plugin and that plugin does not exist on the client side,
# the load ops fails.
#
# this is an unnecessary failure if the default is not the plugin actually required by the account to which the client is trying to connect. 
#
# If a client/server protocol implementation does not have its own notion of default authentication plugin and always tried to load the default
# plugin specified by the server, it will fail with an error if that plugin is not available.
#
# To avoid this problem, the protocol implementation used by the client should have its own default plugin and should use it as its first choice,
# (or, alternatively, fall back to this default in case of failrue to load the default plugin specified by the server). Example:
#
# 		) In MysQL 5.7, libmysqlclient uses as its default choice either mysql_native_password or the plugin specified through the MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTH option
# 			for mysql_options()
#
# 		) When a 5.7 client tries to connect to a 8.0 server, the server specifies caching_sha2_password as its default authentication plugin, but the client
# 		still sends credential details per either mysql_native_password or whatever is specified through MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTH
#
# 		) The only time the client loads the plugin specified by the server is for a change-plugin request,, but in that case it can be any plugin
# 			depending on the user account.
#
# 			IN this case, the client must try to load the plugin, and if that plugin is N/A - an error is not optional.
#
# PROXY USERS
#
# The MySQL server authenticates client connections using authentication plugins. The plugin that authenticates a given connection may request that
# 	the connecting (external) user be treated as a different user for privilege-checking purposes.
#
# This enables the external user to be a proxy for the second user; that is, to assume the privileges of teh second user:
#
# 		) The external user is a "proxy user" (a user who can impersonate or become known as another user)
#
# 		) The second user is a "proxied user" (a user whose identity and privs can be assumed by a proxy user)
#
# This section describes how the proxy user capabilitiy works. For general information about auth plugins, see earlier.
#
# FOr more info about seeing how to write a plugin that supports authentication of proxy users, see later.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		AS an alternative to the use of proxy users, role support may provide a suitable way to map users onto specific sets
# 		of named privileges.
#
# REQUIREMENTS FOR PROXY USER SUPPORT
#
# For proxying to occur for a given authentication plugin, these conditions must be satisfied:
#
# 		) Proxying must be supported, either by the plugin itself, or by the MySQL server on behalf of the plugin.
# 			In teh latter case, server support may need to be enabled explicitly.
#
# 		) The proxy user account must be set up to be authenticated by the plugin. Use the CREATE_USER statement to associate
# 			an account with an authentication plugin, or ALTER_USER to change its plugin.
#
# 		) The proxied user account must be created and granted the privileges to be assumed by the proxy user. Use the CREATE_USER and GRANT statements for this.
#
# 		) The proxy user account must have the PROXY privilege for hte proxied account. Use the GRANT statemnet for this.
#
#		) For a client connecting to the proxy account to be treated as a proxy user, the authentication plugin must return a user name different
#			from the client user name - to indicate the user name of the proxied account that defines the privileges to be assumed by the proxy user.
#
# 			Alternatively, for plugins that are provided proxy mapping by the server, the proxied user is determined from the PROXY privilege held by the proxy user.
#
# The proxy mechanism permits mapping only the client user name to the proxied user name.
#
# THere is no provision for mapping host names. When a connecting client matches a proxy account, the server attempts to find a match
# for a proxied account using the user name returned by the authentication plugin and teh host name of the proxy account.
#
# Consider the following account definitions:
#
# 		-- create proxy account
# 		CREATE USER 'employee_ext'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH my_auth_plugin AS 'my_auth_string';
#
# 		--  create proxied account and grant its privileges
# 		CREATE USER 'employee'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'employee_pass';
# 		GRANT ALL ON employees.* TO 'employee'@'localhost';
#
# 		-- grant PROXY privilege to proxy account for proxied account
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'employee'@'localhost' TO 'employee_ext'@'localhost';
#
# When a client connects as employee_ext from the local host, MySQL uses the plugin named my_auth_plugin to perform
# authentication.
#
# SUppose that my_auth_plugin returns a user name of employee to the server, based on the content of 'my_auth_string' and perhaps
# by consulting some external authentication system.
#
# The name employee differs from employee_ext, so returning employee serves as a request to the server to treat the employee_ext client,
# for purposes of privilege checking, as the employee local user.
#
# In this case, employee_ext is the proxy user and employee is the proxied user.
#
# The server verifies that proxy authentication for employee is possible for the employee_ext user by checking whether employee_ext
# (the proxy user) has the PROXY privilege for employee (the proxied user).
#
# If this privilege has not been granted, an error occurs. Otherwise, employee_ext assumes the privileges of employee.
# The server checks statements executed during the client session by employee_ext against the privileges granted to employee.
#
# IN this case, employee_ext can access tables in the employee database.
#
# WHen proxying occurs, the USER() and CURRENT_USER() functions can be used to see the difference between the connecting user 
# (the proxy user) and the account whose privileges apply during the current session (the proxied user).
#
# For the example just described, those functions return these values:
#
# 		SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
# 		+------------------------+--------------------+
# 		| USER() 					 | CURRENT_USER() 	 |
# 		+------------------------+--------------------+
# 		| employee_ext@localhost | employee@localhost |
# 		+------------------------+--------------------+
#
# In the CREATE_USER statement that creates the proxy user account, the IDENTIFIED WITH clause that names the authenticatiojn
# plugin is optionally followed by an AS 'auth_string' clause specifying a string that hte server passes to the plugin when the
# user connects.
#
# If present, the string provides information that helps the plugin determine how to map the external client user name to a proxied user name.
# It is up to each plugin whether it requires the AS clause.
#
# If so, the format of the authentication string depends on how the plugin intends to use it.
# Consult the documentation for a given plugin for information about the authentication string values it accepts.
#
# GRANTING THE PROXY PRIVLEGE
#
# The PROXY privilege is needed to enable an external user to connect as and have the privileges of another user..
# To grant this privilege, use the GRANT statement.
#
# For example:
#
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'proxied_user' TO 'proxy_user';
#
# THe statement creates a row in the mysql.proxies_priv grant table.
#
# At connection time, proxy_user must represent a valid externally authenticated MysQL user, and proxied_user must represent
# a valid locally authenticated user.
#
# Otheriwse, the connection attempt fails.
#
# The corresponding REVOKE syntax is:
#
# 		REVOKE PROXY ON 'proxied_user' FROM 'proxy_user';
#
# MySQL GRANT and REVOKE syntax extensions wokr as usual. For example:
#
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'a' TO 'b', 'c', 'd';
#		GRANT PROXY ON 'a' TO 'd' WITH GRANT OPTION;
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'a' TO ''@'';
# 		REVOKE PROXY ON 'a' FROM 'b', 'c', 'd';
#
# The PROXY privilege can be granted in these cases:
#
# 		) By a user that has GRANT PROXY ... WITH GRANT OPTION for proxied_user.
#
# 		) By proxied_user for itself: The value of USER() must exactly match CURRENT_USER() and proxied_user, for both the user name and host name parts
#			of the account name.
#
# The initial root account created during MySQL installation has the PROXY_..._WITH_GRANT_OPTION privileges for ''@'', that is, for all users and all hosts.
# This enables root to set up proxy users, as well as to delegate to other accoutns the authority to set up proxy users.
#
# FOr example, root can do this:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test';
# 		GRANT PROXY ON ''@'' TO 'admin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
#
# Those statements create an admin user that can manage all GRANT PROXY mappings. For example, admin can do this:
#
# 		GRANT PROXY ON sally TO joe;
#
# DEFAULT PROXY USERS
#
# To specify that some or all users should connect using a given authentication plugin, create a "blank" MySQL acc (''@''), associate it
# with that plugin, and let hte plugin reutrn the real authenticated user name (if different from the blank user).
#
# For example, suppose that there exists a plugin named ldap_auth that implements LDAP authentication and maps connecting
# users unto either a developer or manager account.
#
# To set up proxying of users unto these accounts, use the following statements:
#
# 		-- create default proxy account
# 		CREATE USER ''@'' IDENTIFIED WITH ldap_auth AS '0=Oracle, OU=MySQL';
#
# 		-- create proxied accounts
# 		CREATE USER 'developer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'developer_pass';
# 		CREATE USER 'manager'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'manager_pass';
#
# 		-- grant PROXY privileges to default proxy acount for proxied accounts
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'manager'@'localhost' TO ''@'';
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'developer'@'localhost' TO ''@'';
#
# Now assume that a client connects as follows:
#
# 		mysql --user=myuser --password
# 		Enter PW: *****
#
# The server will not find myuser defined as a MySQL user. But because there is a blank user account (''@'') that matches
# the client user name and host name, the server authenticates the client against that account.
#
# The server invokes the ldap_auth authentication plugin and passes myuser and myuser_pass to it as the user name and user PW.
#
# If the ldap_auth plugin finds in the LDAP directory that myuser_pass is not the  correct password for myuser, authentication
# fails and the server rejects the connection.
#
# If the PW is correct and ldap_auth finds that myuser is a developer, it returns the user name developer to the MySQL server, rather than
# myuser.
#
# Returning a user name different from the client user name of myuser signals to the server that it hsould treat myuser as a proxy.
# THe server verifies that ''@'' can authenticate as developer (because that account has the PROXY privilege to do so), and accepts the connection.
#
# The session proceeds with myuser having the privileges of developer, the proxied user.
#
# (These privileges should be set up by the DBA using GRANT stratements, not shown).
#
# The USER() and CURRENT_USER() functions return these values:
#
# SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
# +---------------------+-----------------+
# | USER() 			   | CURRENT_USER() 	   |
# +------------------+--------------------+
# | myuser@localhost | developer@localhost|
# +------------------+--------------------+
#
# If the plugin instead finds in the LDAP directory that myuser is a manager, it returns manager as the user name and session proceeds
# with myuser having the privileges of manager.
#
# SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
# +------------------+------------------+
# | USER() 			   | CURRENT_USER() 	 |
# +------------------+------------------+
# | myuser@localhost | manager@localhost|
# +------------------+------------------+
#
# For simplicity, external authentication cannot be multilevel: Neither the credentials for developer nor those for manager are taken into account
# in the preceding example.
#
# However, they are still used if a client tries to connect and authenticate directly as the developer or manager account, which is why
# those accounts should be assigned PWs.
#
# DEFAULT PROXY USER AND ANON USER CONFLICTS
#
# If you intend to create a default proxy user, check for other existing "match any user" accounts that take precedence over the default proxy
# user because they can prevent that user from working as intended.
#
# In the preceding discussion, the default proxy user account has '' in the host part, which matches any host. 
#
# If oyu set up a default proxy user, take care to also check whether nonproxy accounts exist with the same user part and '%' in the host part,
# because '%' is wildcard matching, but has precedence over '' because it's more specific.
#
#
# Suppose that a MySQL installation includes these two accounts:
#
# 		-- create default proxy account
# 		CREATE USER ''@'' IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin AS 'some_auth_string';
# 		-- create anonymous account
# 		CREATE USER ''@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password';
#
# The first account (''@'') is intended as the default proxy user, used to authenticate connections for users who do not otherwise match a 
# more-specific account.
#
# THe second account (''@'%') is a anonymous user acc, which might have bene created for example, to enable users without their own acc to connect anonymously.
#
# Both accounts have the same user part (''), which matches any user.
# And each account has a host part that matches any host.
#
# Nevertheless, there is a prio in account matching for connection attempts because the matching rule sort a host of '%' ahead of ''.
# For accoutns that do not match any more-specific account, the server attempts to authenticate them against ''@'%' (anon), rather than ''@'' (default proxy).
#
# The result is that the default proxy acc is never used.
#
# To avoid this, use one of the following strategies:
#
# 		) Remove the anon account so that it does not conflict with the default proxy user.
# 			This might be a good idea anyway, if  you want to associate every connection with a named user.
#
# 		) Use a more-specific default proxy user that matches ahead of the anon user. For example, to permit only localhost proxy connections, use ''@'localhost':
#
# 			CREATE USER ''@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin AS 'some_auth_string';
#
# 			In addition, modify any GRANT PROXY statements to name ''@'localhost' rather than ''@'' as the proxy user.
#
# 			This prevents anon users from localhost, as they will be funneled to the proxy instead.
#
# 		) Create multiple proxy users, one for local connections and one for "everything else" (remote).
# 			This can be useful particularly when local users should have different privileges from remote users.
#
# 			Create the proxy users:
#
# 				-- create proxy user for local connections
# 				CREATE USER ''@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin AS 'some_auth_string';
# 				-- create proxy user for remote connections
# 				CREATE USER ''@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin AS 'some_auth_string';
#
# 			Create the proxied users:
#
# 				-- create proxied user for local connections
# 				CREATE USER 'developer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password';
# 				-- create proxied user for remote connections
# 				CREATE USER 'developer'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password';
#
# 			Grant the proxy privilege to each proxy user for the corresponding proxied user:
#
# 				GRANT PROXY ON 'developer'@'localhost' TO ''@'localhost';
# 				GRANT PROXY ON 'developer'@'%' TO ''@'%';
#
# 			Finally, grant appropiate privs to the local and remote proxied users (not shown)
#
# 			Assume that the some_plugin/'some_auth_string' combination causes some_plugin to map the client user name
# 			to developer.
#
# 			Local connections match the ''@'localhost' proxy user, which maps to the 'developer'@'localhost' proxied user.
# 			Remote connections match the ''@'%' proxy user, which maps to the 'developer'@'%' proxied user.
#
# SERVER SUPPORT FOR PROXY USER MAPPING
#
# 	Some authentication plugins implement proxy user mapping for themselves (for example, the PAM and Windows authentication plugins).
# 	Other authentication plugins do not support proxy users by default.
#
# 	Of these, some can request that hte MySQL server itself map proxy users according to granted proxy privileges:
#
# 		mysql_native_password, sha256_password.
#
# 	If the check_proxy_users SYS_VAR is enabled, the server performs proxy user mapping for any authentication plugins that make such a request:
#
# 		) By default, check_proxy_users is disabled, so the server performs no proxy user mapping even for authentication plugins that request server support for proxy users.
#
# 		) If check_proxy_users is enabled, it may also be necessary to enable plugin-specific SYS_VAR to take advantage of server proxy user mapping support:
#
# 			) For the mysql_native_password plugin, enable mysql_native_password_proxy_users.
#
# 			) For the sha256_password plugin, enable sha256_password_proxy_users
#
# Proxy user mapping performed by the server is subject to these restrictions:
#
# 		) The server will not proxy to or from an anon user, even if the associated PROXY privilege is granted.
#
# 		) When a single account has been granted proxy privileges for more than one proxied account, server proxy user mapping is nondeterministic.
# 			Therefore, granting to a single account proxy privileges for multiple proxy accounts is discouraged.
#
# PROXY USER SYSTEM VARIABLES
#
# Two system variables help trace the proxy login process:
#
# 		) proxy_user: THis value is NULL if proxying is not used. Otherwise, it indicates the proxy user account.
# 							For example, if a client authenticates through the ''@'' proxy account, this variable is set as follows:
#
# 								SELECT @@proxy_user;
# 								+---------------------------+
# 								| @@proxy_user 				 |
# 								+---------------------------+
# 								| ''@'' 							 |
# 								+---------------------------+
#
# 		) external_user: Sometimes the authentication plugin may use an external user to authenticate to the MySQL server.
#
# 								For example, when using Windows native authentication, a plugin that authenticates using the Windows API does not need the
# 								login ID passed to it.
# 
# 								However, it still uses Windows user ID to authenticate.
# 								The plugin may return this external user ID (or the first 512 UTF-8 bytes of it)
# 								to the server using the external_user read-only session variable.
#
# 								If the plugin does not set this variable, its value is NULL.
#
# USER ACCOUNT LOCKING
#
# MySQL supports locking and unlocking user accounts using the ACCOUNT LOCK and ACCOUNT UNLOCK clause for the CREATE_USER and ALTER_USER statements:
#
# 		) When used with CREATE_USER, these clauses specify the initial locking state for a new account.
#
# 			IN the absence of either clause, the account is created in an unlocked state.
#
# 		) WHen used with ALTER_USER, these clauses specify the new locking state for an existing account.
#
# 			In the absence of either clause, the account locking state remains unchanged.
#
# Account locking state is recorded in the account_locked column of the mysql.user table.
# The output from SHOW_CREATE_USER indicates whether an account is locked or unlocked.
#
# If a client attempts to connect to a locked account, the attempt fails. 
#
# THe server increments the Locked_connects status variable that indicates the number 
# of attempts to connect to a locked account, returns an ER_ACCOUNT_HAS_BEEN_LOCKED error, and writes am essage to the error log:
#
# 		Access denied for user 'user_name'@'host_name'
# 		Account is locked.
#
# Locking an account does not affect being able to connect using a proxy user that assumes the identity of the locked account.
# It also does not affect the ability to execute stored programs or views that have a DEFINER clause naming the locked account.
#
# That is, teh ability to use a proxied account or stored programs or views is not affected by locking the account.
#
# The account-locking capability depends on the presence of the account_locked column in the mysql.user table.
# For upgrades to MysQL 5.7 and later from older versions, run mysql_upgrade to ensure that this column exists.
#
# For nonupgraded installations that have no account_locked column, the server treats all accounts as unlocked,
# and using the ACCOUNT LOCK or ACCOUNT UNLOCK clause produces an error.
#
# SQL-BASED MYSQL ACCOUNT ACTIVITY AUDITING
#
# Applications can use the following guidelines to perform SQL-based auditing that ites database activity
# to MySQL accounts.
#
# MySQL accounts correspond to rows in the mysql.user table. WHen a client connects successfully, the server
# authenticates the client to a particular row in this table.
#
# The User and Host column vlaues in this row uniquely identify the account and correspond to the 'user_name'@'host_name'
# format in which account names are written in SQL statements.
#
# The account used to authenticate a client determines which privileges the client has.
# Normally, the CURRENT_USER() function can be invoked to determien which account this is for the client user.
#
# Its value is constructed from the User and Host columns of the user table row for the account.
#
# However, there are circumstances under which the CURRENT_USER() value corresponds not to the client user but to
# a different account.
#
# this occurs in contexts when privilege checking is not based on the client's account:
#
# 		) Stored routines (procedures and functions) defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER characteristic
#
# 		) Vies defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER characteristic
#
# 		) Triggers and events
#
# In those contexts, privlege checking is odne against the DEFINER account and CURRENT_USER() refers to that account
# for the client who invoked the stored routine or view or who caused the trigger to activate.
#
# To determine the invoking user, you can call the USER() function, which returns a value indicating the  actual
# user name provided by the client and the host from which the client connected.
#
# However, this value does not necessarily correspond directly to an account in the user table, because 	the USER()
# value never contains wildcards, whereas account values (as returned by the CURRENT_USER()) may contain user name
# and host name Wildcards.
#
# For example, a blank user name matches any user, so an account of ''@'localhost' enables clients to connect as anon users
# from the local host with any user name.
#
# In this case, if a client as user1 from the local host, USER() and CURRENT_USER() return different values:
#
# SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
# +------------------------------------+
# | USER() 				| CURRENT_USER() 	|
# +------------------+-----------------+
# | user1@localhost 	| @localhost 		|
# +------------------+-----------------+
#
# The host name part of an account can contain wildcards, too.
#
# If the host name contains '%' or '_' pattern chars or uses netmask notation, the account can be used for
# clients connecting from multiple hosts and the current_USER() value will not indicate which one.
#
# For example, the account 'user2'@'%.example.com' can be used by user2 to connect from any host inb the example.com domain.
# If user2 connects from remote.example.com, USER() and CURRENT_USER() return sdifferent values:
#
# SELET USER(), CURRENT_USER();
# +----------------------------+----------------------+
# | USER() 							| CURRENT_USER() 			|
# +---------------------------+-----------------------+
# | user@remote.example.com 	| user2@%.example.com 	|
# +---------------------------+-----------------------+
# 
# If an application must invoke USER() for user auditing (for example, if it does auditing from within triggers) but must also
# be able to associate the USER() value with an account in the user table, it is necessary to avoid accounts that contain wildcards
# in the User and Host column.
#
# Specifically, do not permit User to be empty (which creates an anonymous-user account), and do not permit pattern characters
# or netmask notation in Host values.
#
# All accounts must have a nonempty User  value and literal Host value.
#
# WIth respect to the previous examples, the ''@'localhost' and 'user2'@'%.example.com' accounts should be changed not to use wildcards:
#
# RENAME USER ''@'localhost' TO 'user1'@'localhost';
# RENAME USER 'user2'@'%.example.com' TO 'user2'@'remote.example.com';
#
# If user2 must be able to ocnnect from several hosts in the example.com domain, there should be a separate account for each host.
#
# To extract the user name or host name part from a CURRENT_USER() or USER() value, use the SUBSTRING_INDEX() function:
#
# SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(CURRENT_USER(), '@',1);
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | SUBSTRING_INDEX(CURRENT_USER(), '@', 1) 			 |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | user1 														 |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
#
# SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(CURRENT_USER(), '@', -1);
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | SUBSTRING_INDEX(CURRENT_USER(), '@', -1) 		 |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | localhost 													 |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
#
# USING ENCRYPTED CONNECTIONS
#
# With an unencrypted connection between the MySQL client and the server, someone with access to the network could watch
# all your traffic and inspect the data being sent or received between client and server.
#
# When you msut move information over a network in a secure fahsion, an unencrypted connection is unacceptable.
# To make ay kind of data unreadable, use encryption.
#
# Encryption algorithms must include security elements to resist many kinds of known attacks such as changing the order of encrypted messages
# or replaying data twice.
#
# MySQL supports encrypted connections between clients and the server using the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol.
#
# TLS is sometimes referred to as SSL (Secure SOcket Layer), but MySQL doesn ot actually use the SSL protocol for encrypted connections
# because it's encryption is weak.
#
# TLS uses encryption algorithms to ensure htat data received over a public network can be trusted.
#
# It has mechanisms to detect data change, loss or replay. TLS also incorporates algorithms that provide identity verification
# using the X.509 standard
#
# X.509 makes it possible to identify someone on the Internet. IN basic terms, there should be some entity called a "Certificate Authority" (or CA) that assigns
# electronic certificates to anyone who needs them.
#
# Certificates rely on asymmetric encryption algorithms that have two encryption keys (public and secret).
# A ceritifcate owner  can present the certificate to naother party as proof of identity.
#
# A certificate consists of its owner's public key. Any data encrypted using this public key can be decrypeted using only the corresponding
# secret key, which is held by the owner of the cert.
#
# MySQL can be compiled for encrypted-connection support using OPenSSL or wolfSSL. More on that later.
#
# By default, MySQL propgrams attempts to connect using encryption if the server supports encrypted connections, falling back to
# an unencrypted connection if an encrypted connection cannot be established.
#
# MySQL performs encryption on a per-connection basis, and use of encryption for a given user can be optional or mandatory.
# This enables you to choose an encrypted or unencrypted connection according to the reuqirements of individual applications.
#
# For more info on how to requrie users to use encrypted connections, see the discussion of the REQUIRE clause of the CREATE_USER statement
# (more on that later).
#
# See also the desc. of the require_secure_transport System variable.
#
# ENcrypted connections can be used between master and slave replication servers, more on that later.
#
# For more info about using encrypted connections from the MySQL C API, more on that later.
#
# It is also possible to connect using encryption from within an SSH connection to the MySQL server host.
#
# CONFIGURING MYSQL TO USE ENCRYPTED CONNECTIONS
#
# Several options are avilable to indicate whether to use encrypted connections, and to specify the appropriate certificate and key files.
# This section provides general guideance about configuring the server and clients for encrypted connections:#
# 
# SERVER-SIDE CONFIGURATION FOR ENCRYPTED CONNECTIONS
#
# On the server side, the --ssl option specifies that the server permits but does not require encrypted connections.
# This option is enabled by default.
#
# These options on the server side identify the certificate and key files the server uses when permitting clients to establish
# encrypted connections:
#
# 		) --ssl-ca: The path name to the Ceritifcate Authority (CA) cert file (--ssl-capath is similar but specifies the path name of a directory of CA certificate files)
#
# 		) --ssl-cert: tHe path name of hte server public key certificate file. This can be sent to the client nad authenticated against the CA ceritifcate that it has.
#
# 		) --ssl-key: The path name of the server private key file.
#
# For example to enable the server for encrypted connections, start it with these lines in the my.cnf file, changing the ifle names as necessary:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		ssl-ca=ca.pem
# 		ssl-cert=server-cert.pem
# 		ssl-key=server-key.pem
#
# Each option names a file in PEM format. If oyu need to create the reuqired certificate and key files, see more later.
#
# Alternatively, if you have a MySQL source distrib, you can test your setup using the demonstration certificate and key files in tis
# mysql-test/std_data dir.
#
# MySQL servers compiled using OpenSSL can generate missing certificate and key files automatically at startup.
#
# THe server performs certificate and key file autodiscovery. If --ssl is enabled (possibly along with --ssl-cipher) and other --ssl-xxx options are not given
# to configure encrypted connections explicitly, the server attemtps to enable support for encrypted connections automatically at startup:
#
# 		) If the server discovers valid certificate and key files named ca.pem, server-cert.pem, and server-key.pem in the data dir, it enables support for
# 			encrypted connections by clients. (The files need not have been generated automatically, what matters is that they have the indicated names and are valid).
#
# 		) If the server does not find valid certificate and key files in the data directory, it continues executing but without support for encrypted connections.
#
# If the server automatically enables support for encrypted connections, it writes a note to the error log.
# If the server discovers that hte CA certificate is self-signed, it writes a 	warning to hte error log .(Teh certificate if self-signed if created automatically by the server,
# or manually using mysql_ssl_rsa_setup).
#
# The server uses the names of any automatically discovered and used certificate and key files to set the corresponding system variable (ssl_ca, ssl_cert, ssl_key)
#
# For further control over whether clients must connect using encryption, use the require_secure_transport system variable.
# To specify permitted encrypted protocols explicitly, use the tls_verison system variable.
#
# CLIENT-SIDE CONFIGURATION FOR ENCRYPTED CONNECTIONS
#
# By default, MySQL client programs attempt to establish an encrypted connection if the server supports encrypted connections, with further control
# available through the -ssl-mode option:
#
# 		) In the absence of an --ssl-mode option, clients attempt to connect using encryption, falling back to an unencrypted connection if an encrypted
# 			connection cannot be established.
#
# 			THis is also the behavior with an explicit --ssl-mode=PREFFERED option.
#
# 		) With --ssl-mode=REQUIRED, clients requrie an encrypted connection and fail ifo ne cannto be stablished.
#
# 		) with --ssl-mode=DISABLED, client use an unencrypted connection.
#
# 		) With --ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA or --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY, clients require an encrypted connection, and also perform verification
# 			against the server CA certificate and (with VERIFY_IDENTITY) against the server host name in its certificate.
#
# The following options on the client side identify the certificate and key files clients use when establishing encrypted connections to the server.
# They are similar to the options used on the server side, but --ssl-cert and --ssl-key identify the client public and privat key:
#
# 		) --ssl-ca: The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file. This option, if used, must specify the same ceritifcate used by the server.
# 						(the --ssl-capath is similar but specifies the path name of a  DIrectory of CA certificate files).
#
# 		) --ssl-cert: The path name of the client public key certificate file.
#
# 		) --ssl-key: THe path name of the client private key file.
#
# For additional security relative to that provided bny the default encryption, clients can supply a CA certificate matching the one used by the
# server and enable host name identity verification.
#
# IN this way, teh servr and client place their trust in the same CA certificate and client verifies that the host to which it connected
# is the one intended:
#
# 		) To specify the CA certificate, use --ssl-ca (or --ssl-capath), and specify --ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA
#
# 		) To enable host name identity verification as well, use --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY rather than --ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA
#
# 		NOTE:
#
# 			Host name identity verification does not work with self-signed certificates created automatically by the server, or manually using 
# 			mysql_ssl_rsa_setup.
#
# 			Such self-signed certificates do not contain the server name as the Common Name value.
#
# Depending on the encryption requirements of the MySQL account used by a client, the client may be required to specify certain
# options to connect using encryption to a MYSQL server that supports encrypted connections.
#
# Suppose that you weant to connect using an account that has no special encryption requirements or was created using a CREATE_USER
# statement that includes the REQUIRE SSL option.
#
# Assuming that the server supports encrypted connections, a client can connect using encryption with no --ssl-mode option or
# with an explicit --ssl-mode=PREFFERED option:
#
# 		mysql
#
# OR
#
# 		mysql --ssl-mode=PREFERRED
#
# For an account with REQUIRE SSL, the connection attempt fails if an encrypted connection cannot be established.
#
# FOr an account with no special encryption requirements, the attempt falls back to an unencrypted connection if an 
# encrypted connection cannot be established.
#
# To prevent fallback and fail if an encrypted connection cannot be obtained, connect like this:
#
# 		mysql --ssl-mode=REQUIRED
#
# If the account has no more stringent security requirements, other options must be specified to establish an encrypted connection:
#
# 		) For accounts with REQUIRE X509, clients must specify at least --ssl-cert and --ssl-key. In addition, --ssl-ca (or --ssl-capath)
# 			is recommended so that hte public certificate provided by the server can be verified.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 			mysql --ssl-ca=ca.pem \
# 					--ssl-cert=client-cert.pem \
# 					--ssl-key=client-key.pem 
#
# 		) For accounts that have REQUIRE ISSUER or REQUIRE SUBJECT, the option requirements are the same as for REQUIRE X509, but the certificate
# 			must match the issue or subject, respectively, specified in the account definition.
#
# FOr additional informaton about the REQUIRE clause, more later.
#
# To prevent use of encryption and override other -ssl-xxx options, invoke the client  program with --ssl-mode=DISABLED
#
# 		mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED
#
# To specify 	permitted encryption protocls explicitly, use the --tls-version option, more later.
#
# To determine whether the current connection with the server user encryption, check the vlaue of the Ssl_cipher status variable.
# If the value is empty, the connection is not encrypted.
#
# Otherwise, the connection is encrypted and the value indicates the encryption ciher. For example:
#
# 	SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher';
# +---------------------------------------------+
# | Variable_name  | Value 							|
# +----------------+----------------------------+
# | Ssl_cipher 	 | DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256  |
# +----------------+----------------------------+
#
# For the mysql client, an alternative is to use the STATUS or \s command and check the SSL line:
#
# 		\s
# 		... 
# 		SSL: Not in use
# 		... 
#
# OR
#
# \s
# ...
# SSL: Cipher in use is DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
# ...
# 
# COMMAND OPTIONS FOR ENCRYPTED CONNECTIONS
#
# This section describes options that specify whether to use encrypted connections, the names of certificate and key files,
# and other params related to encrypted-connection support.
#
# These options can be given on the command line or in an option file.
#
# For examples of suggested use and how to check whether a connection is encrypted, more later.
#
# For info about using encrypted connections from the MySQL C API, more later.
#
# ENCRYPTED-CONNECTION OPTION SUMMARY
#
# 		FORMAT 					DESCRIPTION 												INTRODUCED
#
# --skip-ssl 		Do not use encrypted connection
#
# --ssl 				Enable encrypted connection
#
# --ssl-ca 			File that contains list of trusted SSL Certificate Authorities
#
# --ssl-capath 	Directory that contains trusted SSL Certificate Authority certificate files
#

#
# --tls-version 	Protocols permitted for encrypted connections
#
# 	) --ssl
#
# 			NOTE: The client side --ssl option is removed in MySQL 8.0. For Cient programs, use --ssl-mode instead.
#
# 		On the server side, the --ssl option specifies that hte server permits but does not require encrypted connections.
#
# 		The option is enabled on the server side by default. --ssl is implied by other --ssl-xxx options, as indicated in the desc for those options.
#
# 		The --ssl option in negated form indicates that encryption should not be used and overrides other --ssl-xxx options.
# 		SPecify the options as --ssl=0 or a synonym (--skip-ssl, --disable-ssl)
#
# 		TO specify additional parameters for encrypted connections, use at least --ssl-cert and --ssl-key on the server side and
# 		--ssl-ca on the client side.
#
# 		Read earlier sections for that. That section also describes server capabilities for certificate and key file autogeneration and autodiscovery.
#
# ) --ssl-ca=<file_name>
#
# 		The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file in PEM format. On the server side, this option implies --ssl.
#
# 		To tell the client not to authenticate the server certificate when establishing an encrypted connection to the server,
# 		specify neither --ssl-ca nor --ssl-capath.
#
# 		THe server still verifies the client according to any applicable requirements established for the client account, and sitll
# 		uses any --ssl-ca or --ssl-capath option values specified on the server side.
#
# ) --ssl-capath=dir_name
#
 #		THe path name of hte directory that contains trusted SSL ceritifcate authority (CA) certificate files in PEM format: On the server side,
 # 		this option implies --ssl.
 #
 # 	To tell the client not to authenticate the server certificate when establishing an encrypted connection to the server,
 # 	specify neither --ssl-ca nor --ssl-capath.
 #
 # 	The server sitll verifies the client according to any applicable requirements established for the client account,
 # 	and it sitll uses any --ssl-ca or --ssl-capath option values specified on the server side.
 #
 # 	MySQL distribs compiled using OpenSSL support the --ssl-capath option (see later).
 #
 # 	Distribs compiled using wolfSSL do not because wolfSSL does not look in any directory and do not followed chained certificate trees.
 # 	wolfSSL requries that all components of the CA certificate tree be contained within a single CA certificate tree and that each
 # 	certificate in the file has a unique SubjectName vlaue.
 #
 # 	To work around this wolfSSL limitation, concatenate the individual certificate files comprising the certificate tree into
 # 	a new file and specify that file as the  value of the --ssl-ca option.
 #
 # ) --ssl-cert=file_name
 #
 # 	The path name of the SSL public key certificate file in PEM format. 
 #
# 		ON the client side, this is the client public key. On teh server side, this is the server pubic key certificate.
#
# 		On the server side, this option implies --ssl.
#
# 	--ssl-cipher=cipher_list
#
# 		The list of permitted ciphers for connection encryption. If no cipher in the list is supported, encrypted connections will not work.
#
# 		ON the server side, this option implies --ssl.
#
# 		For greatest portability, cipher_list should be a list of one or more cipher names, separated by colons.
# 		Example:
#
# 			--ssl-cipher=AES128-SHA
# 			--ssl-cipher=DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES128-SHA
#
# 		OpenSSL supports a more flexible syntax for specifying ciphers, as described in the OpenSSL documentation.
#
# 		wolfSSL does not, so attempts to use that extended syntax fail for a MySQL distrib compiled using wolfSSL.
#
# 		For info about which encryption ciphers MySQL supports, more on that later.
#
# ) --ssl-crl=file_name
#
# 		The path name of the file certificate revocation lists in PEM format.
#
# 		On the server side, this option implies --ssl.
#
# 		If neither --ssl-crl nor --ssl-crlpath  is given, no CRL checks are performed, even if the CA path contains certificate revocation lists.
#
# 		MySQL distribs compiled using OpenSSL support the --ssl-crl option.
# 		Distribs compiled using wolfSSL do not because revocation lists do not work with wolfSSL.
#
# )--ssl-crlpath=dir_name
#
# 		The path name of the directory that contains certificate revocation list files in PEM format.
#
# 		On the server side, this option implies --ssl.
#
# 		If neither --ssl-crl nor --ssl-crlpath is given, no CRL checks are performed, even if the CA path contains certificate revocation lists.
#
# 		MySQL distribs compiled using OpenSSL suport the --ssl-crlpath.
# 		distribs compiled using wolfSSL do not because revocation lists do not work with wolfSSL.
#
# ) --ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT}
#
# 		Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side. 
#
# 		The --ssl-fips-mode option differs from other --ssl-xxx options in that it is not used
# 		to establish encrypted connections, but rahter to affect which cryptographic operations are permitted.
#
# 		These --ssl-fips-mode vlaues are permitted:
##
# 			) OFF -> disalbes FIPS mode.
#
# 			) ON -> Enable FIPS mode.
#
# 			) STRICT -> Enable "strict" FIPS mode.
#
# 				NOTE:
#
# 					If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only permitted value for --ssl-fips-mode is OFF.
# 					In this case, setting --ssl-fips-mode to ON or STRICT causes the client to produce a warning at startup and to operate in non-FIPS mode.
#
# )  --ssl-key=file_name
#
# 		The path name of hte SSL private key in PEM format. On the client side, this is the client private key.
# 		ON the server side, this is the server private key.
#
# 		On the server side, this option implies --ssl.
#
# 		If the key file is protected by a passphrase, the program prompts the user for the passphrase.
# 		The password must be given interactively; it cannot be stored in a file.
#
# 		If hte passphrase is incorrect, the program continues as if it could not read the key.
#
# 		For better security - use a certificate with an RSA key size of at least 2048 bits.
#
# ) --ssl-mode=mode
#
# 		This option is available only for client programs, not hte server.
#
# 		It specifies the security state of the connection to the server.
# 		These option values are permitted:
#
# 			) PREFERRED - Establishes an encrypted connection if the server supports encrypted connections, falling back to an unencrypted connection
# 								if an encrypted connection cannot be established.
#
# 								This is the default if --ssl-mode is not specified.#
# 
# 								Encrypted connections over Unix sockets are disabled by default, so PREFERRED does not establish an encrypted connection.
# 								To enforce encryption on Unix socket connections, use REQUIRED or above.
#
# 			) REQUIRED - Establish an encrypted connection if the server supports encrypted connections. The connection attempts fail if an encrypted
# 								connection cannot be established.
#
# 			) VERIFY_CA: Like REQUIRED, but additionally verify the server Certificate Authority (CA) certificate againstr the configured CA certificates.
# 							The connection attempt fails if no valid matching CA certificates are found.
#
# 			) VERIFY_IDENTITY: Like VERIFY_CA, but additionally perform host name identity verification by checking the host name the client uses
# 										for connecting to the server against the identity in the certificate that hte server sends to the client:
#
# 										) As of MySQL 8.0.12, if the client uses OpenSSL 1.0.2 or higher, the client checks whether the host name that it uses
# 											for connecting matches either the Subject Alternative Name value or the Common Name value in the server certificate.
#
# 										) Otherwise, the client checks whether the host name that it uses for connecting matches the Common Name value in the server certificate.
#
# 									The connection fails if there is a mismatch. For encrypted connections, this option helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
#
# 										NOTE:
#
# 											Host name identity verification does not work with self-signed certificates created automatically by the server,
#												or manually using mysql_ssl_rsa_setup.
#
# 											Such self-signed certificates do not contain the server name as the Common Name Value.
#
# 			) DISABLED: Establish an unencrypted connection.
#
# 			The --ssl-mode option interacts with CA certificate options as follows:
#
# 				) If --ssl-mode is not explicitly set otherwise, use of --ssl-ca or --ssl-capath implies --ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA
#
# 				) For --ssl-mode values of VERIFY_CA or VERIFY_IDENTITY, --ssl-ca or --ssl-capath is also required, to supply a CA certificate
#					that matches the one used by the server.
#
# 				) An explicit --ssl-mode option with a value other than VERIFY_CA or VERIFY_IDENTITY, together with an explicit --ssl-ca or --ssl-capath option,
# 					produces a warning that no verification of the server certificate will be done, despite a CA certificate option being specified.
#
# To require use of encrypted connections by a MySQL account, use CREATE_USER to create the account with a REQUIRE SSL clause, or use ALTER_USER
# for an existing account to add a REQUIRE SSL clause.
#
# Connection attempts by a client that uses the account will be rejected unless MySQL supports encrypted connections and an encrypted connection
# can be established.
#
# The REQUIRE clause permits other encryption-related options, which can be used to enforce security requirements stricter than REQUIRE SSL.
#
# For additional details about which command options may or must be specified by clients that connect using accounts configured using the various
# REQUIRE options, see more later on CREATE USER syntax.
#
# ) --tls-version=protocol_list
#
# 	For client programs, the protocols permitted by the client for encrypted connections.
#
# 	The value is a comma-separated list containing one or more protocol names.
#
#  For example:
#
# 		mysql --tls-version="TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"
#
# For protocols that can be named for this option depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL.
#
# On the server side, use the tls_version system variable instead.
#
# CREATING SSL AND RSA CERTIFICATES AND KEYS
#
# The following discussion describes how ot create the files required for SSL and RSA support in MysQL.
# File creation can be performed using facilities provided by MySQL itself, or by invoking the openssl command directly.
#
# SSL certificate and key files enable MySQL to support sencrypted connections using SSL.
#
# RSA key files enable MySQL to support secure password exchange over unencrypted connections for accounts authenticated 
# by the sha256_password or caching_sha2_password plugin.
#
# CREATING SSL AND RSA CERTIFICATES AND KEYS USING MYSQL
#
# MySQL provides these ways to create the SSL certificate and key files and RSA key-pair files required to support
# encrypted connections using SSL and secure password exchange over RSA over unenecrypted connections,, if those files are missing:
#
# 		) The server can autogenerate these files at startup, for MySQL distribs compiled using OpenSSL
#
# 		) Users can invoke the mysql_ssl_rsa_setup utility manually.
#
# 		) For some distribution types, such as RPM packages, mysql_ssl_rsa_setup, invocation occurs during data directory initialization.
# 			In this case, the MySQL distrib need not have been compiled using OpenSSL as long as the openssl command is available.
#
# 			IMPORTANT:
#
# 				Server autogeneration and mysql_ssl_rsa_setup help lower the barrier to using SSL by making it easier to generate
# 				the required files.
#
# 				However, certificates generated by these methods are self-signed, which may not be very secure.
#
# 				After you gain experience using such files, consider obtaining certificate/key material from a registered
# 				certificate authority.
#
# AUTOMATIC SSL AND RSA FILE GENERATION
#
# For MySQL distributions compiled using OpenSSL, the MySQL server has the capability of automatically generating missing SSL
# and RSA files at startup.
#
# The auto_generate_certs, sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys, and caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys System Variable
# contain automatic generation of these files.
#
# Both variables are enabled by default.
#
# They can be enabled at startup and inspected but not set at runtime.
#
# At startup, the server automatically generates server-side and client-side SSL certificate and key files in the data direcotry if the
# auto_generate_certs System Variable is enabled, no SSL options other than --ssl are specified, and the server-side SSL files
# are missing from the data directory.
#
# These files enable encrypted client connections using SSL.
#
# 	1. The server checks the data directory for SSL files with hte following names:
#
# 			ca.pem
# 			server-cert.pem
# 			server-key.pem
#
# 	2. If any of those files are present, the server creates no SSL files.
# 		Otherwise, it creates them, plus some additional files:
#
# 			ca.pem 				Self-signed CA certificate
# 			ca-key.pem 			CA private key
#
# 			server-cert.pem 	Server certificate
# 			server-key.pem 	Server private key
#
# 			client-cert.pem 	Client certificate
# 			client-key.pem 	Client private key	
#
# 	3. If the server autogenerates SSL files, it uses the names of the ca.pem, server-cert.pem and server-key.pem files to set
# 		the corresponding system variables (ssl_ca, ssl_cert, ssl_key)
#
# At startup, the server automatically generates RSA private/public key-pair files in the data directory if all of these conditions are true:
#
# The sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys or caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys system variable is enabled;
#
# No RSA options are specified;
#
# The RSA files are missing from the data directory.
#
# These key-pair files enable secure password exchange using RSA over unencrypted connections for accounts authenticated
# by the sha256_password or caching_sha2_password plugin.
#
# 1. The server checks the data directory for RSA files with the following names:
#
# 			private_key.pem 		Private member of private/public key pair
# 			public_key.pem 		Public member of private/public key pair
#
# 2. If any of these files are present, the server creates no RSA files. Otherwise, it creates them.
#
# 3. If the server autogenerates the RSA files, it uses their names to set the corresponding system variables
# 		(sha256_password_private_key_path and sha256_password_public_key_path, caching_sha2_password_private_key_path and
# 		caching_sha2_password_public_key_path)
#
# MANUAL SSL AND RSA FILE GENERATION USING MYSQL_SSL_RSA_SETUP
#
# MySQL distribs include a mysql_ssl_rsa_setup utility that can be invoked manually to generate SSL and RSA files.
#
# This utility is included with all MySQL distributions (whether compiled using OpenSSL or wolfSSL), but it does reuqire
# that the openssl command be available.
#
# SSL AND RSA FILE CHARACHTERISTICS
#
# SSL and RSA files created automatically by the server or by invoking mysql_ssl_rsa_setup have these characteristics:
#
# 		) SSL and RSA keys have the size of 2048 bits.
#
# 		) The SSL CA certificate is self signed.
#
# 		) The SSL server and client certificates are signed with the CA certificate and key, using the sha256WithRSAEncryption signature algorithm.
#
# 		) SSL certs use these common names (CN) values, with the appropriate certificate type (CA, Server,Client):
#
# 			ca.pem: 				MySQL_Server_suffix_Auto_Generated_CA_Certificate
# 			server-cert.pm: 	MySQL_Server_suffix_Auto_Generated_Server_Certificate
# 			client-cert.pm: 	MySQL_Server_suffix_Auto_Generated_Client_Certificate
#
# 			The suffix value is based on the MySQL version number.
#
# 			For files generated by mysql_ssl_rsa_setup, the suffix can be specified explicitly using the --suffix option.
#
# 			For files generated by the server, if the resulting CN values exceed 64 characters, the _suffix portion of the name is omitted.
#
# 		) SSL files have blank values for Country (C), State of Province (ST), Organization (O), Organization Unit Name (OU) and email address.
#
# 		) SSL files created by the server or by mysql_ssl_rsa_setup are valid for ten years from the time of generation.
#
# 		) RSA files do not expire.
#
# 		) SSL files have different serial numbers for each certificate/key pair (1 for CA, 2 for Server, 3 for Client)
#
# 		) Files created automatically by the server are owned by the account that runs the server.
#
# 			Files created using mysql_ssl_rsa_setup are owned by the user who invoked that program.
#
# 			This can be changed on systems that support the chown() system call if the program is invoked by root and --uid option is given
# 			to specify the user who should own the files.
#
# 		) On Unix and Unix-like systems, the file access mode is 644 for certificate files (that is, world readable), and 600 for key files (only accessible by the acc that runs the server)
#
# To see the contents of an SSL certificate (for example, to check the range of dates over which it is valid), invoke openssl directly:
#
# 		openssl x509 -text -in ca.pem
# 		openssl x509 -text -in server-cert.pem
# 		openssl x509 -text -in client-cert.pem
#
# It is also possible to check SSL certificate expiration information using this SQL statement:
#
# 		SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_server_not%';
# 		+----------------------+-------------------------+
# 		| Variable_name 		  | Value   	 			    |
# 		+----------------------+-------------------------+
# 		| Ssl_server_not_after | Apr 28 14:16:39 2027 GMT|

# 
# CREATING SSL CERTIFICATES AND KEYS USING OPENSSL
#
# This section describes how ot use openssl command to set up SSL certificate and key files for use by MySQL servers and clients.
# The first example shows a simplified procedure such as you might use from the command line.
#
# The second shows a script that contains more detail.
#
# The first two examples are intended for use on Unix and both use the openssl command that is part of OpenSSL.
# The third example describes how to set up SSL files on Windows.
#
# NOTE:
# 		There are easier alternatives to generating the files required for SSL than the procedure described here: Let the server autogenerate them or
# 		use the mysql_ssl_rsa_setup program.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# 		Whatever method you use to generate the certificate and key files, the Common Name value used for the server and client certificates/keys must each
# 		differ from the Common Name value used for the CA certificate.
#
# 		Otherwise, the certificate and key files will not work for servers compiled using OpenSSL.
# 		A typical error in this case is:
#
# 			ERROR 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error:
# 			error: 00000000001:lib(0):func(0):reason(1)
#
# EXAMPLE 1: CREATING SSL FILES FROM THE COMMAND LINE ON UNIX
#
# 	The following examples show a set of commands to create MySQL and client certificates and key files.
# 	You will need to respond to several prompts by the openssl commands.
#
# 	To generate test files, you can press Enter to all prompts.
# 	To generate files for production use, you should provide nonempty responses.
#
# 	# Create clean environment
# 	rm -rf newcerts
# 	mkdir newcerts && cd newcerts
#
# 	# Create CA certificate
# 	openssl genrsa 2048 > ca-key.pem
#	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 3600 \
# 				-key ca-key.pem -out ca.pem
#
# 	# Create server certificate, remove passphrase, and sign it
# 	# server-cert.pem = public key, server-key.pem = private key
# 	openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 \
# 				-nodes -keyout server-key.pem -out server-req.pem
# 	openssl rsa -in server-key.pem -out server-key.pem
# 	openssl x509 -req -in server-req.pem -days 3600 \
# 				-CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out server-cert.pem
#
# # Create client certificate, remove passphrase, and sign it
# # client-cert.pem = public key, client-key.pem = private key
# openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 \
# 			-nodes -keyout client-key.pem -out client-req.pem
#
# openssl rsa -in client-key.pem -out client-req.pem
# openssl x509 -req -in client-req.pem -days 3600 \
# 			 -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out client-cert.pem
#
# After generating the certificates, verify them:
#
# 		openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server-cert.pem client-cert.pem
#
# You should see a response like this:
#
# 	server-cert.pem: OK
# 	client-cert.pem: OK
#
# To see the contents of a certificate (for example, ,to check the range of dates over which a certificate is valid), invoke openssl like this:
# 	
# 	openssl x509 -text -in ca.pem
# 	openssl x509 -text -in server-cert.pem
# 	openssl x509 -text -in client-cert.pem
#
# Now you have a set of files that can be used as follows:
#
# 	) ca.pem: Use this as the argument to --ssl-ca on the server and client sides. (The CA certificate, if used, must be the same on both sides.)
#
# 	) server-cert.pem, server-key.pem: Use these as the arguments to --ssl-cert and --ssl-key on the server side.
#
# 	) client-cert.pem, client-key.pem: Use these as the arguments to --ssl-cert and --ssl-key on the client side.
#
#
# EXAMPLE 2: CREATING SSL FILES USING A SCRIPT ON UNIX
#
#
# Here is an example script that shows how to set up SSL certificate and key files for MySQL.
# After executing the script, use the files for SSL connections as described earlier.
#
# DIR=`pwd`/openssl
# PRIV=$DIR/private
#
# mkdir $DIR $PRIV $DIR/newcerts
# cp /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf $DIR

# CREATING RSA KEYS USING OPENSSL
#
# This section describes how to use the openssl command to set up the RSA key files that enable MySQL to support secure
# PW exchange over unenecrypted connectiosn for accounts authenticated by the sha256_password and caching_sha2_password plugins.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		There are easier alternatives to generating the files required for RSA than the procedure described here:
# 		Let the server autogenerate them or use the mysql_ssl_rsa_setup.
#
# To create hte RSA private and public key-pair files, run these commands while logged into the system account used to run the MySQL
# server so the files will be owned by that account:
#
# 		openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
# 		openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
#
# Those commands create 2,048 bit-keys. To create stronger keys, use a larger value.
#
# Then set the access modifiers for the key files.
# THe private key should be readable only by the server, whereas the public key can be freely distributed
# to client users:
#
# chmod 400 privte_key.pem
# chmod 444 public_key.pem
#
# OPENSSL VERSUS WOLFSSL
#
# MySQL can be compiled using OpenSSL or wolfSSL, both of which enable encrypted connections based on the openSSL API:
#
# 		) MysQL enterprise edition binary distribs are compiled using OpenSSL. It is not possible to use wolfSSL with MYSQL enterprise edition
#
# 		) mySQL community edition binary distribs are ocmpiled using openSSL
#
# 		) MySQL community edition source distribs can be compiled using either OpenSSL or wolfSSL.
#
# OpenSSL and wolfSSL offer the same basic functionality, but MySQL distribs compiled using OpenSSL have additional features.
#
# 		) OpenSSL supports a wider range of encryption ciphers from which to choose for the --ssl-cipher option.
# 			OpenSSL supports the --ssl-capath, --ssl-crl and --ssl-crlpath options.
#
# 		) Accounts that authenticate using the sha256_password plugin can use RSA key files for secure PW exchanges over unencrypted connections.
#
# 			Accounts that authenticate using caching_sha2_password plugin can use RSA key pair-based PW exchange regardless
# 			of whether MysQL was compiled using OpenSSL or wolfSSL.
#
# 		) The server can automatically generate missing SSL and RSA certificate and key files at startup.
#
# 		) OpenSSL supports more encryption modes for the AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() functions. MOre later on that.
##
# Certain OpenSSL-related System and Status variables are present only if MysQL was compiled using OpenSSL.
#
# These are:
#
# ) auto_generate_certs
#
# ) caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys
#
# ) sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys
#
# ) sha256_password_private_key_path
#
# ) sha256_password_public_key_path
#
# ) Rsa_public_key
#
# To determine whether a server was compiled using openSSL, test the existence of any of those variables.
#
# For example, this statement returns a row if OpenSSL was used and an empty result if wolfSSL was used:
#
# SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Rsa_public_key';
#
# Building MySQL with Support for Encrypted Connections
#
# To use encrypted connections between the MySQL server and client programs, your system must support either OpenSSL or wolfSSL:
#
# 		) MySQL enterprise edition binary distribs are compiled using OPenSSL. It is not possible to use wolfSSL with MysQL enterprise edition.
#
# 		) MySQL community edition binary distribs are compiled using OpenSSL.
#
# 		) mySQL community edition source distrib can be compiled using either OpenSSL or wolfSSL.
#
# IF you compile MySQL from a source distrib, CMake configures the distribs to use OpenSSL by default.
#
# To compile using OpenSSL, use this procedure:
#
# 	1. Ensure that OPenSSL 1.0.1 or higher is installed. IF the installed OPenSSL is lower than 1.0.1, CMake produces an error
# 		at MySQL config time.
#
# 	2. The WITH_SSL CMake option determines which SSL library to use for compiling MySQL.
#
# 		The default is -DWITH_SSL=system which uses OpenSSL.
#
# 		To make this explicit, specify that option on the CMake cmd line.
# 		For example:
#
# 		cmake . -DWITH_SSL=system
#
# 		That command configures the distrib to use the installed OpenSSL lib.
#
# 		Alternatively, to explicitly specify the path name to the OpenSSL installation, use the 
#  	following syntax:
#
# 		This can be useful if you have multiple versions of OpenSSL installed, ot prevent CMake from choosing the wrong one:
#
# 			cmake . -DWITH_SSL=path_name
#
# 	3. Compile and install the dstrib
#
# To compile using wolfSSL, download the wolfSSL distrib and apply a small patch.
# For instructions, see the extra/README_wolfssl.txt file.
#
# To check whether a mysqld server supports encrypted connections, examine the value of the have_ssl SYS_VAR:
#
# 	SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_ssl';
# 	+---------------------------------+
# 	| Variable_name 		| 	Value 	 |
# 	+--------------------+------------+
# 	| have_ssl 				| YES 		 |
# 	+--------------------+------------+
#
# If the value is YES, the server supports encrypted connections. If the value is DISABLED, the server is capable of supporting
# encrypted connections - but was not started with the appropriate --ssl-xxx options to eanble encrypted connections to be used.
#
# ENCRYPTED CONNECTION PROTOCOLS AND CIPHERS
#
# To determine which encryption protocol and cipher are in use for an encrypted connection, use the following statemnts to check
# the vlaues of the Ssl_version and Ssl_cipher status variables:
#
# 	SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_version';
# 	+------------------------------------+
# 	| Variable_name 		| Value 			 |
# 	+--------------------+---------------+
# 	| Ssl_version 			| TLSv1 			 |
# 	+--------------------+---------------+
#
# SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher';
# +---------------------------------------+
# | Variable_name 		| Value 				|
# +---------------------+-----------------+
# | Ssl_cipher | DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256|
# +------------+--------------------------+
#
# If the connection is not encrypted, both variables have an empty value.
#
# MySQL supports encrypted connections using the TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols.
#
# The value of the tls_version system variable determines which protocols the server is permitted to use from those that are available.
# The tls_version value is a comma-separated list containing one or more of these protocols (not case-sensetive):
#
# TLSv1, TlSv1.1, TLSv1.2
#
# By default, this variable lists all protocols supported by the SSL library used to compile MySQL.
# To determine the value of tls_version at runtime, use this statement:
#
# SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'tls_version';
# +------------------------------------------+
# | Variable_name 		| 	Value 				|
# +---------------------+--------------------+
# | tls_version 	| TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2  |
# +---------------------+--------------------+
#
# To change the value of tls_version, set it at server startup.
#
# For example, to prohibit connections that use the less secure TLSv1 protocol use these lines at the server
# my.cnf file:
#
# 	[mysqld]
# 	tls_version=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2
#
# To be even more restrictive and only permit TLSv1.2 connections, use tls_version like this:
#
# 	[mysqld]
# 	tls_version=TLSv1.2
#
# For client programs, the --tls-version option enables specifying the TLS protocols permitted per client invocation.
#
# The value format is the same as for tls_version.
#
# by default, MySQL attempts to use the highest TLS protocol verison avaialable, depending on which SSL library was used
# to compile the server and client, which key size is used and whether the server or client are restricted from using
# some protocols; for example, by means of tls_version/--tls-version
#
# ) TLSv1.2 is used if possible
#
# ) TLSv1.2 does not work with all ciphers that have a key size of 512 bits or less. To use this protocol with such a key, use --ssl-cipher to 
# 		specify the cipher name explicit:
#
# 			AES128-SHA
# 			AES128-SHA256
# 			AES256-SHA
# 			AES256-SHA256
# 			CAMELLIA128-SHA
# 			CAMELLIA256-SHA
# 			DES-CBC3-SHA
# 			DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
# 			RC4-MD5
# 			RC4-SHA
# 			SEED-SHA
#
# ) For better security, use a certificate with an RSA key size of at least 2048 bits.
#
# If the server and client protocol capabilities have no protocol in common, the server terminates the connection request.
#
# FOr example, if the server is configured with tls_version=TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 - connection attempts will fail for clients invoked
# with --tls-version=TLSv1, and for older clients that do not support the --tls-version option and implicitly support only TLSv1.
#
# MySQL permits specifying a list of protocols to support.
#
# This list is passed directly down to the underlying SSL library and is ultimately up to that library what protocols it
# actually enables from the supplied list.
#
# Please refer to the MySQL source code and SSL_CTX_new documentation for information about how the SSL library handles this.
#
# For openSSL, see the SSL_CTX_new documentation.
#
# To determine which ciphers a given server supports, use the following statements to check the value of the Ssl_cipher_list status variable:
#
# 		SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher_list';
#
# Order of ciphers passed by MySQL to the SSL library is significant.
# More secure ciphers are mentioned first in the list, and the first cipher supported by the provided certificate is selected.
#
# MySQL passes this cipher list to the SSL library:
#
# ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
# ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
# ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
# etc.
#
# //This list is long and largely uninteresting.
#
# These cipher restrictions are in place:
#
# 		) The following ciphers are permanently restricted:
#
# 			!DHE-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA
# 			!DHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA
# 			!ECDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA
# 			!ECDH-ECDSA-DES-CBC3-SHA

# 			!LOW
# 			!MD5
# 			!DES
# 			!RC2
# 			!RC4

#
# CONNECTING TO MYSQL REMOTELY FROM WINDOWS WITH SSH
#
# This section describes how to get an encrypted connection to a remote MySQL server with SSH.
# 
# 1. Install an SSH client on your Windows machine. For a comparison of SSH clients, see places.
#
# 2. Start your Windows SSH client. Set Host_name = yourmysqlserver_URL_OR_IP.
# 	
# 		Set userid=your_userid to log in to your server.
#
# 		This userid value might not be the same as the user name of your MySQL account.
#
# 3. Set up port forwarding. Either do a remote forward (set Local_port: 3306, remote_host: yourmysqlservername_or_ip, remote_port: 3306) or a local
# 		forward (Set port: 3306,host: localhost, remote port: 3306)
#
# 4. save
#
# 5. Log in with the SSH
#
# 6. Start some ODBC app.
#
# 7. Create a new file in Windows and link to MySQL using the ODBC driver the same way you normally do.
# Except type in localhost for the MySQL host server, not yourmysqlservername
#
# At this point, you should have an ODBC connection to MySQL, encrypted using SSH.
#
#
# SECURITY COMPONENTS AND PLUGINS
#
# MySQL includes several components and plugins that implement security features:
#
# 		) Plugins for authenticating attempts by clients to connect to MySQL server.
#
# 			Plugins are avialable for several authentication protocols.
#
# 		) A PW validation component for implementing PW strength policies and assessing their strength of potetional PWs.
#
# 		) Keyring plugins that provide secure storage for sensitive information.
#
# The following pertain to MysQL Enterprise only:
#
# 		) MySQL Enterprise also has MySQL Enterprise Audit, implemented using a server plugin - uses the open MySQL audit API
# 			to enable standard, policy-based monitoring and logging of connection and query activity executed on specific MySQL servers.
#
# 			Designed to meet the Oracle audit specification, MySQl Enterprise Audit provides an otu of teh box, easy to use Auditing and compliance
# 			solution for applications that are governed by both internal and external regulation guidelines.
#
# 		)  MysQL Enterprise firewall, an application-level firewall that enables DB admins to permit or deny SQL statements execution based
# 			on matching against whitelists of accepted statement patterns.
#
# 			This helps harden MySQL servers against attacks such as Injections or attempts to exploit applications by using them outside
# 			of their legitimate query workload characteristics.
#
# 		) MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-identification, imeplement as a plugin library containing a plugin and a set of user-defined
#			functions.
#
# 			Data masking hides senseitive information by replacing rela values with substitutes.
#
# 			Enables obfuscation, generation of formatted random data and data replacement or substitution.
#
# AUTHENTICATION PLUGINS
#
# The following seciton describes pluggable authentication methods available in MysQL and the plugins that implement these methods.
#
# The default plugin is indicated by the value of the default_authentication_plugin system variable.
#
# NATIVE PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# MySQL includes a mysql_native_password plugin that implements native authentication;
# That is, authentication based on the PW hashing method in use from before the introduction of pluggable authentication.
#
# The following table shows the plugin names on the server and client sides.
#
# PLUGIN AND LIBRARY NAMES OR NATIVE PW AUTHENTICATION
#
# plugin or file 			Name
#
# Server-side plugin 	mysql_native_password
#
# Client-side plugin 	mysql_native_password
#
# Library file 			None (plugins are built in)
#
# INSTALLING NATIVE PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# THe mysql_native_password plugin exists in server and client form:
#
# ) THe server-side plugin is built into the server, need not be loaded explicitly and cannot be disabled by unloading it.
#
# ) The client side plugin is built into the libmysqlclient client library and is available to any program linked against libmysqlclient.
#
# USING NATIVE PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# MySQL client programs use mysql_native_password by default.
#
# The --default-auth option can be used as a hint about which client-side plugin the program can expect
# to use:
#
# mysql --default-auth=mysql_native_password
#
# SHA-256 PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# MySQL provides two authentication plugins that implement SHA-256 hashing for user account PWs:
#
# 	) sha256_passwords: Implements basic SHA-256 authentication
#
# 	) caching_sha2_password: Implements SHA-256 authentication (like sha256_password), but uses caching on the server side for better performance 
# 		and has additional features for wider applicability.
#
# THis section is for the original noncaching SHA-2 authentication plugin.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# 		IN MySQL 8.0, caching_sha2_password is the default authentication plugin rather than mysql_native_password.
#
# 		For information about the implications of this change for server ops and compability of the server with clients 
# 		and connectors, see caching_sha2_password as the Preferred Authentication PLugin
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# 		To connect to the server using a account that authenticates with the sha256_password plugin, you must use either a TLS connection
# 		or an unencrypted connection that supports PW exchange using an RSA key pair, as described later in this section.
#
# 		Either way, the sha256_password plugin uses MySQL's encryption capabilities.
#
# Note:
#
# 		In the name sha256_password, "sha256" refers to the 256-bit length the plugin uses for encryption.
# 		In the name caching_sha2_password "sha2" refers more generally to the SHA-2 class of encryption algorithms.
#
# 		Of which, 256-bit encryption is one instance.
#
# PLUGIN AND LIBRARY NAMES FOR SHA-256 AUTHENTICATION
#
# Plugin or File 			Plugin or File name
#
# server-side plugin 	sha256_password
#
# Client-side plugin 	sha256_password
#
# Library file 			None (built in)
#
# INSTALLING SHA-256 PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The sha256_password plugin exists in server and client forms:
#
# 		) The server-side plugin is built into the server, need not be loaded explicitly, and cannot be disabled by unloading it.
#
# 		) The client-side plugin is built into the libmysqlclient library and is available to any program linked against libmysqlclient
#
# USING SHA-256 PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# To set up an account taht uses the sha256_password plugin for SHA-256 PW hashing, use the following statement, where PW is the desired acc pw:
#
# CREATE USER 'sha256user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'password';
#
# The server assigns the sha256_password plugin to the account and uses it ot encrypt the PW using SHA-256, storing those values
# in the plugin and authentication_string columns of the mysql.user system table.
#
# The preceding instructions do not assume that sha256_password is teh default authentication plugin.
#
# If sha256_password is the default authentication plugin, a simpler CREATE_USER syntax can be used.
#
# To start the server with the default authentication plugin set to sha256_password, put these lines in the server option file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		default_authentication_plugin=sha256_password
#
# That causes the sha256_password plugin to be used by default for new accounts.
#
# As a result, it is possible to create the account and set its Password without naming the plugin explicitly:
#
# 	CREATE USER 'sha256user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#
# Anotehr consequence of setting default_authentication_plugin to sha256_password, is that - to use some other plugin for account creation,
# you must specify that plugin explicitly.
#
# For example - to use the mysql_native_password plugin - use this statement:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'nativeuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
#
# sha256_password supports connections over secure transport.
#
# Sha256_password also supports encrypted password exchange using RSA over unencrypted connections, if these conditions are satisfied:
#
# 		) MYSQL is compiled using OpenSSL.
#
# 			MySQL can be compiled using either OpenSSL or yaSSL, and sha256_password works with distribs compiled using
# 			either package, but RSA support requires OpenSSL.
#
# 		) The MYSQL server to which you wish to connect is configured to support RSA (using the RSA configuration procedure given later in this section)
#
#
# RSA support has these characeteristics:
#
# 		) On the server side, two system variables name the RSA private and public key-pair files:
#
# 				sha256_password_private_key_path 
#
# 				and
#
# 				sha256_password_public_key_path
#
# 			The Database admin must set these vars at server startup if the key files to use have names that differ
# 			from the SYS_VAR default values.
#
# 		) The server uses the sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys SYS_VAR to determine whether to automatically
#			generate the RSA key-pair file.
#
# 		) The Rsa_public_key status variable displays the RSA public key used by the sha256_password authentication plugin.
#
# 		) Clients that are in possession of the RSA public key can perform RSA key pair-based password exchange with the server
# 			during the connection process, as described later.
#
# 		) For connections by accounts that authenticate with sha256_password and RSA public key pair-based PW exchange, the server
# 			sends the RSA public key to the client as needed.
#
# 			However, if a copy of the public key is available on the client host, the client can use it to save a round trip in the client
# 			/Server protocol:
#
# 				) For these command-line clients, use the --server-public-key-path option to specify the RSA public key file:
#
# 						mysql, mysqladmin, mysqlbinlog, mysqlcheck, mysqldump, mysqlimport, mysqlpump, mysqlshow, mysqlslap, mysqltest, mysql_upgrade
#
# 				) For programs that use the C API, call mysql_options() to specify the RSA public key file by passing the MYSQL_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY
#					option and the name of the file.
#
# 	 			) For replication slaves, use the  CHANGE_MASTER_TO statement with the MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH option to specify the RSA public key file.
# 					For Group replication, the group_replication_recovery_get_public_key SYSTEM VARIABLE serves the same purpose.
#
# For clients that use the sha256_password plugin, passwords are never exposed as cleartext when connecting to the server.
# How password transmission occurs depends on whether a secure connection or RSA encryption is used:
#
# 		) If the connection is secure, an RSA key pair is unnecessary and is not used. This applies to encrypted connections that use TLS.
# 			The password is sent as cleartext but cannot be snooped because the connection is secure.
#
# 		) If the connection is not secure, and an RSA key pair is available, teh connection remains unencrypted.
#
# 			This applies to unencrypted connections without TLS. RSA is used only for password exchange between client and server,
# 			to prevent password snooping.
#
# 			When the server receives the encrypted password, it decrypts it. A scramble is used in the encryption to prevent repeat attacks.
#
# 		) If a secure connection is not used and RSA encryption is not available, the connection attempt fails because the PW cannot be sent without
# 			being exposed as cleartext.
#
# As mentioned previously, RSA password encryption is available only if MySQL was compiled using OpenSSL.
#
# The implication for MySQL distribs compiled using wolfSSL is that - to use SHA-256 PWs, clients MUST use an encrypted
# connection to access the server.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		To use RSA pw encryption with sha256_password, the client and server both must be compiled using OpenSSL, not just one of them.
#
# Assuming that MySQL has been compiled using OpenSSL, use the following procedure to enable the use of an RSA key pair for PW exchange
# during the client connection process:
#
# 		1. Create the RSA private and public key-pair files using the previous instructions.
#
# 		2. If the private and public key files are located in the data directory and are named private_key.pem and public_key.pem
# 			(the default values of the sha256_password_private_key_path and sha256_password_public_key_path system variables), the server
# 			uses them automatically at startup.
#
# 			otherwise, to name the key files explicitly, set the system variables to the key file names in the server option file.
#
# 			If the files are located in the server data directory, you need not specify their full path names:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				sha256_password_private_key_path=myprivkey.pem
# 				sha256_password_public_key_path=mypubkey.pem
#
# 			If the key files are not located in the data directory, or to make their locations explicit in the system variable values,
# 			use full path names:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				sha256_password_private_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/myprivkey.pem
# 				sha256_password_public_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/mypubkey.pem
#
# 		3. Restart the server, then connect to it and check the Rsa_public_key status variable value.
#
# 			The value will differ from that shown here, but should be nonempty:
#
# 				SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Rsa_public_key'\G
# 				*********************** 1. row ****************************
# 				
# 				Variable name: Rsa_public_key
# 						Value: ---------- BEGIN PUBLIC KEY --------------
# 				<values>
# 				---------- END PUBLIC KEY -------------
#
# 			If the value is empty, the server found some problem with the key files.
# 			Check the error log for diagnostic information.
#
# After the server has been configured with the RSA key files, accounts that authenticate with the sha256_password plugin
# have the option of using those key files to connect to the server.
#
# As mentioned previously, such accounts can use either a secure connection (in which case RSA is not used) or an unencrypted
# connection that performs password exchange using RSA. Suppose that an unenecrypted connection is used.
#
# For example:
#
# 		mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha256user -p
# 		Enter password: password
#
# For this connection attempt by sha256user, the server determines that sha256_password is the appropriate authentication plugin
# and invokes it (because that was the plugin specified at CREATE_USER point of time).
#
# The plugin finds that the connection is not encrypted and thus requires the password to be transmitted using RSA encryption.
# In this case, the plugin sends the RSA public key to the client, which uses it to encrypt the PW and returns the result to the sever.
#
# The plugin uses the RAS private key on the server side to decrypt the password and accepts or rejects the connection based
# on whether the password is correct.
#
# The server sends the RSA public key to the client as needed. However, if the client has a file containing a local coppy of the
# RSA public key required by the server, it can specify the file using the --server-public-key-path option:
#
# 		mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha256user -p --server-public-key-path=file_name
# 		Enter password: password
# 
# The public key value in the file named by the --server-public-key-path option should be the same as the key value in the server-side
# file named by the sha256_password_public_key_path system variable.
#
# If the key file contains a valid public key value but the value is incorrect, an access-denied error occurs.
# If the key file does not contain a valid public key, the client program cannot use it.
#
# In this case, the sha256_password plugin sends the public key to the client as if no --server-public-key-path option had been specified.
#
# Client users can obtain the RSA public key two ways:
#
# 		) The database administrator can provide a copy of the public key file.
#
# 		) A client user who can connect to the server some other way can use a SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Rsa_public_key' statement
# 			and save the returned key value in a file.
#
# CACHING SHA-2 PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# MySQL provides two authentication plugins that implement SHA-256 hashing for user account passwords:
#
# 		) sha256_password: Implements basic SHA-256 authentication
#
# 		) caching_sha2_password: Implements SHA-256 authentication (like sha256_password), but uses caching on the server side
# 			for better performance and has additional features for wider applicability
#
# This section describes the caching SHA-2 authentication plugin.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# 		In MySQL 8.0, caching_sha2_password is the default authentication plugin rather than mysql_native_password.
#
# 		For more information about the implications of this change for server ops and compatibility of the server with
# 		clients and connectors, see later.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# 		To connect to the server using an account that authenticates with the caching_sha2_password plugin, you must
# 		use either a secure connection or an unencrypted connection that supports password exchange using an RSA key pair,
# 		as described later in this section.
#
# 		Either way, the caching_sha2_password plugin uses MySQL's encryption capabilities.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		In the name sha256_password, "sha256" refers to the 256-bit digest length the plugin uses for encryption.
#
# 		In the name caching_sha2_password, "sha2" refers more generally to the SHA-2 class of encryption algorithms,
# 		of which 256-bit encryption is one instance
#
# 		The latter name choice leaves room for future expansion of possible digest lengths without changing the plugin name.
#
# The caching_sha2_password plugin has these advantages, compared to sha256_password:
#
# 		) On the server side, an in-memory cache enables faster reauthentication of users who have connected previously when they connect again.
#
# 		) RSA-based password exchange is available regardless of the SSL library against which MySQL is linked.
#
# 		) Support is provided for client connections that use the Unix socket-file and shared-memory protocols.
#
# PLUGIN AND LIBRARY NAMES FOR SHA-2 AUTHENTICATION
#
# Plugin or File 				Plugin or File name
#
# Server-side plugin 		caching_sha2_password
#
# Client-side plugin 		caching_sha2_password
#
# Library file 				None (plugins are built in)
#
# Installing SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication
#
# The caching_sha2_password plugin exists in server and client forms:
#
# 		) The server-side plugin is built into the server, need not be loaded explicitly, and cannot be disabled by unloading it.
#
# 		) The client-side plugin is built into the libmysqlclient client library and is available to any program linked against libmysqlclient
#
# The server-side plugin uses the sha2_cache_cleaner audit plugin as a helper to perform password cache management.
# sha2_cache_cleaner, like caching_sha2_password is built in and need not be installed.
#
# USING SHA-2 PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# To set up an account that uses the caching_sha2_password plugin for SHA-256 password hashing, use the following statement,
# where password is the desired account password:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'sha2user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'password';
#
# The server assigns the caching_sha2_password plugin to the account and uses it to encrypt the password using SHA-256,
# storing those values in the plugin and authentication_string columns of the mysql.user system table.
#
# The preceding instructions do not assume that caching_sha2_password is the default authentication plugin.
#
# If caching_sha2_password is the default authentication plugin, a simpler CREATE_USER syntax can be used.
#
# To start the server with the default authentication plugin set to caching_sha2_password, put these lines in the
# server option file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		default_authentication_plugin=caching_sha2_password
#
# That causes the caching_sha2_password plugin to be used by default for new accounts.
# As a result, it is possible to create the account and set its password without naming the plugin explicitly:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'sha2user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#
# Another consequence of setting default_authentication_plugin to caching_sha2_password is that, to use some other
# plugin for account creation, you must specify that plugin explicitly.
#
# For example, to use the mysql_native_password plugin, use this statement:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'nativeuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
#
# caching_sha2_password supports connections over secure transport.
#
# If you follow the RSA configuration procedure given later in this section, it also supports encrypted
# password exchange using RSA over unencrypted connections.
#
# RSA support has these characteristics:
#
# 		) On the server side, two system variables named the RSA private and public key-pair files:
#
# 				caching_sha2_password_private_key_path
#
# 				and
#
# 				caching_sha2_password_public_key_path
#
# 			The database administrator must set these variables at server startup if the key files to use have names
# 			that differ from the system variable default values.
#
# 		) The server uses the caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys system variable to determine whether to automatically
# 			generate the RSA key-pair files.
#
# 		) The Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key status variable displays the RSA public key value used by the caching_sha2_password 
# 			authentication plugin.
#
# 		) Clients that are in possession of the RSA public key can perform RSA key pair-based password exchange with the server during
# 			the connection process, as described later.
#
# 		) For connections by accounts that authenticate with caching_sha2_password and RSA key pair-based password exchange, the server does
# 			not send the RSA public key to clients by default.
#
# 			Clients can use a client-side copy of the required public key, or request the public key from the server.
#
# 			Use of a trusted local copy of the public key enables the client to avoid a round trip in the client/server protocol, and is
# 			more secure than requesting the public key from the server.
#
# 			On the other hand, requesting the public key from the server is more convenient (it requires no management of a client-side file)
# 			and may be acceptable in secure network environments.
#
# 				) For command-line clients, use the --server-public-key-path option to specify the RSA public key file.
#
# 					Use the --get-server-public-key option to request the public key from the server.
#
# 					The following programs support the two options: mysql, mysqlsh ,mysqladmin, mysqlbinlog, mysqlcheck, mysqldump,
# 					mysqlimport, mysqlpump, mysqlshow, mysqlslap, mysqltest, mysql_upgrade
#
# 				) For programs that use the C API, call mysql_options() to specify the RSA public key file by passing the MYSQL_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY
# 					option and the name of the file, or request the public key from the server by passing the MYSQL_OPT_GET_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY option.
#
#
# 				) For replication slaves, use the CHANGE_MASTER_TO statement with the MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH option to specify the RSA public key file,
# 					or the GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY option to request the public key from the master.
#
# 					For Group Replication, the group_replication_recovery_public_key_path and group_replication_recovery_get_public_key system variables
# 					serve the same purpose.
#
# In all cases, if the option is given to specify a valid public key file, it takes precedence over the option to request the public key from the server.
#
# For clients that use the caching_sha2_password plugin, passwords are never exposed as cleartext when connecting to the server.
#
# How password transmission occurs depends on whether a secure connection or RSA encryption is used:
#
# 		) If the connection is secure, an RSA key pair is unnecessary and is not used. This applies to encrypted TCP connections that use TLS,
# 			as well as Unix socket-file and shared-memory connections.
#
# 			The password is sent as cleartext but cannot be snooped because the conn is secure.
#
# 		) If the connection is not secure, an RSA key pair is used. This applies to unencrypted TCP connections without TLS and named-pipe connections.
# 			RSA is used only for password exchange between client and server, to prevent password snooping.
#
# 			When the server receives the encrypted password, it decrypts it. A scramble is used in the encryption to prevent repeat attacks.
#
# To enable use of an RSA key pair for password exchange during the client connection process, use the following procedure:
#
#  	1. Create the RSA private and public key-pair files using earlier instructions.
#
# 		2. If the private and public key files are located in the data directory and are named private_key.pem and public_key.pem
# 			(the default values of the caching_sha2_password_private_key_path and caching_sha2_password_public_key_path system variables), the server
# 			uses them automatically at startup.
#
# 			Otherwise, to name the key files explicitly, set the system variables to the key file names in the server option file.
# 			
# 			If the files are located in the server data directory, you need not specify their full path names:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				caching_sha2_password_private_key_path=myprivkey.pem
# 				caching_sha2_password_public_key_path=mypubkey.pem
#
# 			If the key files are not located in the data directory, or to make their locations explicit in the system variable values, use full path names:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				caching_sha2_password_private_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/myprivkey.pem
# 				caching_sha2_password_public_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/mypubkey.pem
#
# 		3. Restart the server, then connect to it and check the Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key status variable value.
#
# 			The value will differ from that shown here, but should be nonempty:
#
# 				SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key'\G
# 				************************* 1. row ****************************
# 				Variable_name: Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key
# 							Value: -------BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----------
# 				<values>
# 				---------END PUBLIC KEY-------
#
# 			If the value is empty, the server found some problems with the key files.
# 			Check the error log for diagnostic information.
#
# 			After the server has been configured with the RSA key files, accounts that authenticate with the caching_sha2_password plugin
# 			have the option of using thoose key files to connect to the server.
#
# 			As mentioned previously, such accounts can use either a secure connection (in which case RSA is not used) or
# 			an unencrypted connection that performs password exchange using RSA.
#
# 			Suppose that an unencrypted connection is used. For example:

# 			plugin and invokes it (because that was the plugin specified at CREATE_USER time).
#
# 			The plugin finds that the connection is not encrypted and thus requires the password to be transmitted
# 			using RSA encryption.
#
# 			However, the server does not send the public key to the client, and the client provided no public key,
# 			so it cannot encrypt the PW and teh connection fails:
#
# 			ERROR 2061 (HY000): Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password'
# 			reported error: Authentication requires secure connection
#
# 			To request the RSA public key from the server, specify the --get-server-public-key option:
#
# 				mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha2user -p --get-server-public-key
# 				Enter password: password
#
# 			In this case, the server sends the RSA public key to the client, which uses it to encrypt the password and returns the 
# 			result to the server.
#
# 			The plugin uses the RSA private key on the server side to decrypt the PW and accepts or rejects the conection based
# 			on whether the PW is correct.
#
# 			Alternatively, if the client has a file containing a local copy of the RSA public key required by the server, it can
# 			specify the file using the --server-public-key-path option:

# 				mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha2user -p --server-public-key-path=file_name
# 				Enter password: password
#
# 			In this case, the client uses the public key to encrypt the password and returns the results to the server.

#
# 			The public key value in the file named by the --server-public-key-path option should be the same as the key value

# 			If the key file contains a valid public key value but the value is incorrect, an access-denied error occurs.
#
# 			If the key file does not contain a valid public key, the client program cannot use it.
#
# 			Client users can obtain the RSA public key two ways:
#
# 				) The database admin can provide a copy of the public key file
#
# 				) A client user who can connect to the server some other way can use a SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key"
# 					statement and save the returned key value in a file.
#
# CACHE OPERATION FOR SHA-2 PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# On the server side, the caching_sha2_password plugin uses an in-memory cache for faster authentication of clients who have
# connected previously.
#
# Entries consists of account-name/password-hash pairs. The cache works like this:
#
# 		1. When a client connects, caching_sha2_password checks whether the client and password match some cache entry.
#
# 			If so, authentication succeeds.
#
# 		2. If there is no matching cache-entry, the plugin attempts to verify the client against the credentials in the mysql.user system table.
#
# 			If this succeeds, caching_sha2_password adds an entry for the client to the hash. Otherwise, authentication fails and the connection is rejected.
#
# In this way, when a client first connects, authentication against the mysql.user system table occurs.
#
# When the client connects subsequently, faster authentication against the cache occurs.
#
# Password cache operations other than adding entries are handled by the sha2_cache_cleaner audit plugin,
# which performs these actions on behalf of caching_sha2_password:
#
# 		) It clears the cache entry for any account that is renamed or dropped, or any account for which the credentials or authentication
# 			plugins are changed.
#
# 		) It empties the cache when the FLUSH_PRIVILEGES statement is executed.
#
# 		) It empties the cache at server shutdown. (This means the cache is not persistent across server restarts).
#
# Cache cleaning operations affect the authentication requirements for subsequent client connections.
#
# For each user account, the first client connection for the user after any of the following operations must use a 
# secure connection (made using TCP using TLS credentials, a Unix socket file, or shared memory) or RSA key pair-based
# PW exchange:
#
# 		) After account creation
#
# 		) After a PW change for the account
#
# 		) After RENAME_USER for the account
#
# 		) After FLUSH_PRIVILEGES
#
# FLUSH_PRIVILEGES clears the entire cache and affects all accounts that use the caching_sha2_password plugin.
# The other operations clear specific cache entries and affect only accounts that are part of the operation.
#
# Once the user authenticates successfully, the account is entered into the cache and subsequent connections do not require
# a secure connection or the RSA key pair, until another cache clearing event occurs that affects the account.
#
# (When the cache can be used, the server uses a challenge-response mechanism that does not use cleartext password
# transmission and does not require a secure connection).
#
# CLIENT-SIDE CLEARTEXT PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# A client-side authentication plugin is available that sends the PW to the server without hashing or encryption.
#
# THis plugin is built into the MySQL client lib.
#
# The following table shows the plugin name.
#
# PLUGIN AND LIBRARY NAMES FOR CLEARTEXT AUTHENTICATION
#
# Plugin or File 			Plugin or File Name
# Server-side plugin 	None, see discussion
#
# Client-side plugin 	mysql_clear_password
#
# Library file 			None (plugin is built in)
#
# With many MySQL authentication methods, the client performs hashing or encryption of the password before sending it to the server.
# This enables the client to avoid sending the PW in clear text.
#
# Hashing or encryption cannot be done for authentication schemes that require the server to receive the PW as entered on the client side.
# In such cases, the client-side mysql_clear_password plugin is used to send the PW to the server in clear text.
#
# There is no corresponding server-side plugin. Rather, the client-side plugin can be used by any server-side plugin that needs
# a cleartext PW.
#
# Examples are PAM and simple LDAP authentication plugins.
#
# The following discussion provides usage information specific to clear text pluggable authentication.
# For general information about pluggable authentication in MySQL, see earlier.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Sending PWs in clear text may be a security problem in some configurations.
#
# 		To avoid problems if there is any possibility that the password would be intercepted,
# 		clients should connect to MySQL Server using a method that protects the password.
#
# 		Possibilities include SSL, IPsec or a private network.
#
# To make inadvertent use of the mysql_clear_password plugin less likely, MySQL clients must explicitly enable it.
# This can be done in several ways:
#
# 		) Set the LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN environment variable to a value that begins with 1, Y or y.
#
# 			This enables the plugin for all client connections.
#
# 		) The mysql, mysqladmin, mysqlcheck, mysqldump, mysqlshow and mysqlslap client programs support an --enable-cleartext-plugin option
# 			that enables the plugin on a per-invocation basis.
#
# 		) The mysql_options() C API function supports a MYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN option that enables the plugin on a per-connection basis.
#
# 			Also, any program that uses libmysqlclient and reads option files can enable the plugin by including an enable-cleartext-plugin option
# 			in an option group read by the client library.
#
# PAM PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# NOte:
#
# 		The PAM pluggable authentication is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product.
# 
# MySQL Enterprise Edition supports an authentication method that enables MySQL Server to use PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
# to authenticate MySQL users.
#
# PAM enables a system to use a standard interface to access various kinds of authentication methods, such as UNIX passwords or an LDAP directory.
#
# PAM pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:
#
# 		) External authentication: PAM authentication enables MySQL server to accept connections from users defined outside the MySQL grant tables
# 			and that authenticate using methods supported by PAM.
#
# 		) Proxy user support: PAM authentication can return to MySQL a user name different from the login user, based on the groups the external user
# 										is in and the authentication string provided.
#
# 									This means that the plugin can return the MySQL user that defines the privileges the external PAM-authenticated user should have.
#
# 									For example, a user named joe can connect and have the privileges of the user named developer.
#
# PAM pluggable authentication has been tested on Linux and macOS.
#
# The PAM plugin uses the information passed to it by MySQL Server (such as user name, host name, password and authentication string),
# 	plus whatever method is available for PAM lookup.
#
# The plugin checks the user credentials against PAM and returns 'Authentication succeeded, Username is user_name' or
# 'Authentication failed'.
#
# The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The file name suffix might differ on your system.
#
# The file must be located in the directory named by the plugin_dir SYSTEM VARIABLE.
#
# PLUGIN AND LIBRARY NAMES FOR PAM AUTHENTICATION
#
# PLugin or File 					PLugin or file name
#
# Server-side plugin 			authentication_pam
#
# Client-side plugin 			mysql_clear_password
#
# Library file 					authentication_pam.so
#
# The client-side clear-text plugin that communicates with the server-side PAM plugin is built into the libmysqlclient client library
# and is included in all distribs, including community distribs.
#
# Inclusion of the client-side clear-text plugin in all MySQL distribs enables clients from any distrib to connect
# to a server that has the server-side plugin loaded.
#
# INSTALLING PAM PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# This section describes how ot install the PAM authentication plugin. 
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin dir (the dir named by the plugin_dir 
# system variable).
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# The plugin library file base name is authentication_pam. The file name suffix differs per platform (for example, .so for Unix and
# Unix-like systems, .dll for Windows)
#
# To load the plugin at server startup, use the --plugin-load-add option to name the library file that contains it.
#
# With this plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the server starts.
# For example, put these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix for your platform as necessary):
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		plugin-load-add=authentication_pam.so
#
# After modifying my.cnf, restart the server to cause the new settings to take effect.
#
# Alternatively, to register the plugin at runtime, use this statement (adjust the .so suffix as necessary):
#
# 		INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_pam SONAME 'authentication_pam.so';
#
# INSTALL_PLUGIN loads the plugin immediately, and also registers it in the mysql.plugins system table to cause
# the server to load it for each subsequent normal startup.
#
# To verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# for example:
#
# 		SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%pam%';
# 		+-------------------------------+
# 		| PLUGIN_NAME | 					  |
# 		+-------------+-----------------+
# 		| authentication_pam | ACTIVE   |
# 		+-------------------------------+
#
# If the plugin fails to intiialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# To associate MySQL accounts with the PAM plugin, see Using PAM Pluggable Authentication.
#
# UNINSTALLING PAM PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The method used to uninstall the PAM authentication plugin depends on how you installed it:
#
# 		) If you installed the plugin at server startup using a --plugin-load-add option, restart the server without the option.
#
# 		) If you installed the plugin at runtime using INSTALL_PLUGIN, it remains installed across server restarts. To uninstall it, use UNINSTALL_PLUGIN:
#
# 			UNINSTALL PLUGIN authentication_pam;
#
# USING PAM PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# This section describes how to use the PAM authentication plugin to connect from MySQL client programs to the server.
# It is assumed that the server is running with the server-side plugin enabled, as described in Installing PAM Pluggable Authentication.
#
# TO refer to the PAM authentication plugin in the IDENTIFIED WITH clause of a CREATE_USER statement, use the name authentication_pam.
# For example:
#
# 		CREATE USER user
# 			IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
# 			AS 'authentication_string';
#
# The authentication string specifies the following types of information:
#
# 		) PAM supports the notion of "service name", which is a name that the system administrator can use to configure
# 			the authentication method for a particular application.
#
# 			There can be several such "applications" associated with a single database server instance, so the choice of service name
# 			is left to the SQL application developer.
#
# 			When you define an account that hsould authenticate using PAM, specify the service name in the authentication string.
#
# 		) PAM provides a way for a PAM module to return to the server a MySQL user name other than the login name supplied at login time.
# 			Use the authentication string to control the mapping between login name and MySQL user name.
#
# 			If you want to take advantage of proxy user capabilities, the authentication string must include this kind of mapping.
#
# For example, if the service name is mysql, and users in the root and users PAM groups should be mapped to the developer and data_entry
# MySQL users, respectively, use a statement like this:
#
# 		CREATE USER user
# 			IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
# 			AS 'mysql, root=developer, users=data_entry';
#
# Authentication string syntax for the PAM authentication plugin follows these rules:
#
# 		) The string consists of a PAM service name, optionally followed by a group mapping list consisting of one or more keyword/value pairs
# 			each specifying a group name and a MysQL user name:
#
# 				pam_service_name[,group_name=mysql_user_name]...
# 
# 			The plugin parses the authentication string on each login check. To minimize overhead, keep the string as short as possible.
#
# 		) Each group_name=mysql_user_name pair must be preceded by a comma.
#
# 		) Leading and trailing spaces not inside double "" marks are ignored.
#
# 		) Unquoted pam_service_name, group_name and mysql_user_name values can contain anything except =, , or space
#
# 		) If a pam_service_name, group_name or mysql_user_name value is quoted with ", everything between the quotation marks is part of a value.
# 
# 			tHis is necessary, fo rexample, if the value contains space chars.
#
# 			All characters are legal except double quotation mark and \.
# 			To include either character, escape it with a \.
#
# If the plugin successfully authenticates a login name, it looks for a group mappings list in the authentication string and,
# if present, uses it to return a different user name to teh MySQL server based on the groups the external user is a member of:
#
# 		) If the authentication string contains no group mapping list, the plugin returns the login name.
#
# 		) If the authentication string does contain a group mapping list, the plugin examines each group_name=mysql_user_name pair in the
# 			list from left to right and tries to find a match for the group_name value in a non-MySQL directory of the groups assigned
# 			to the authenticated user and returns mysql_user_name for the first match it finds.
#
# 			If the plugin finds no match for any group, it returns the login name.
#
# 			If the plugin is not capable of looking up a group in a directory, it ignores the group mapping list and
# 			returns the login name.
#
# THe following sections describe how to set up several authentication scenarios that use the PAM authentication plugin:
#
# 	) No proxy users. This uses PAM only to check login names and PWs.
#
# 		Every external user permitted to connect to MySQL Server should have a matching MySQL account that is defined to use
# 		external PAM authentication.
#
# 		(For a MySQL account of user_name@host_name to match the external user, user_name must be the login name and host_name
# 		must match the host from which the client connects).
#
# 		Authentication can be performed by various PAM-supported methods.
#
# 		The discussion shows how to use traditional Unix PWs and LDAP.
#
# 		PAM authentication, when not done through proxy users or groups, requires the MySQL account to have the same
# 		user name as the Unix account.
#
# 		MySQL user names are limited to 32 chars.
#
# 		Which limits PAM nonproxy authentication to Unix accounts with a name of at most 32 chars.
#
# ) Proxy login only and group mapping. For this scenario, create one or a few MySQL accounts that define different sets of privileges.
#
# 		(Ideally, nobody should connect using those accounts directly).
#
# 	Then define a default user authenticating through PAM that uses some mapping scheme (usually by the external groups the users are in)
# to map all the external logins to the few MySQL accounts holding the privilege sets.
#
# Any user that logs in is mapped to one of the MySQL accoutns and uses its privileges.
#
# THe discussion shows how ot set htis up using Unix PWs, but other PAM methods such as LDAP could be used instead.
#
# Variations of these scenarios are possible. For example, you can permit some users to log in  directly (without proxying)
# but reuqire others to connect through proxies.
#
# the examples make the following assumptions. You might need to make some adjustments, if your system is set up differently.
#
# 	) The PAM configuration directory is /etc/pam.d
#
# 	) The PAM service name is mysql, which means that you must set up a PAM file named mysql in the PAM configuration directory (creating
# 		the file if it does not exist).
#
# 		If you use a service name different from mysql, the file name will differ and you must use a different name in the AS `auth_string` 
# 		clause of CREATE_USER statements.
#
# 	) The examples use a login name of antonio and a password of verysecret. Change these accoridng to the user you want ot authenticate.
#
# The PAM authentication plugin checks at initialization time whether the AUTHENTICATION_PAM_LOG environemtn value is set in the server's
# startup environment.
#
# If so, the plugin enables logging of diagnostic messages to the standard output.
#
# Depeding on how  your server is started, the message might appear on the console or in the error
# log.
#
# These messages can be helpful for debugging PAM-related problems that occur when the plugin performs authentication.
#
# UNIX PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION WITHOUT PROXY USERS
#
# The authentication scenario uses PAM only to check Unix user login names and passwords.
#
# Every external user permitted to connect to MySQL Server should have a matching MySQL account that is defined
# to use external PAM authentication.
#
# 1) Verify that Unix authentication in PAM permits you to log in as the respective user.
#
# 2) Set up PAM to authenticate the mysql service by creating a file named /etc/pam.d/mysql.
#
# 		The file contents are system dependent, so check existing login-related files in the
# 		/etc/pam.d directory to see what they look like.
#
# 		On Linux, the mysql file might look like this:
#
# 			#%PAM-1.0
# 			auth 				include 			password-auth
# 			account 			include 			password-auth
#
# 		For Gentoo Linux, use system-login rather than password-auth. For macOS, use login rather than password-auth
#
# 		The PAM file format might differ on some systems. For example, on Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems, use these files
# 		contents instead:
#
# 			@include common-auth
# 			@include common-account
# 			@include common-session-noninteractive
#
# 3) Create a MySQL account with the same user name as the Unix login name and define it to authenticate using the PAM plugin:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'antonio'@'localhost'
# 			IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam AS 'mysql';
# 		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydb.* TO 'antonio'@'localhost';
#
# 4. Connect to the MySQL server using the mysql command-line client. For example:
#
# 		mysql --user=antonio --password 	--enable-cleartext-plugin mydb
# 		Enter password: verysecret
#
# The server should permit the connection and the following query hsould return output as shown:
#
# 		SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
# 		+-----------------------------------------------------+
# 		| USER() 				| CURRENT_USER() 	 | @@proxy_user|
# 		+--------------------+------------------+-------------+
# 		| antonio@localhost 	| antonio@localhost| NULL 		   |
# 		+--------------------+------------------+-------------+
#
# This demonstrates that antonio uses the privileges granted to the antonio MySQL acc, and taht no proxy has occured.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The client-side mysql_clear_password plgin with which the sever-side PAM plugin communicates sends the PW to the MySQL server in clear
# 		text so it can be passed to PAM.
#
# 		THis is necessary to use the server-side PAM library, but may be a security problem in some configurations.
#
# 		These measures minimize the risk:
#
# 				) To make inadvertent use of the mysql_clear_password plugin less likely, MySQL clients must explicitly enable it;
# 					for example, with the --enable-cleartext-plugin option.
#
# 			) To avoid PW exposure with the mysql_clear_password plugin enabled, MySQL clients should connect to the MySQL server
# 				using a secure connection.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		On some systems, Unix authentication uses /etc/shadow, a file that typically has restricted access permissions.
#
# 		This can cause MySQL PAM-based authentication to fail. Unfortunately, the PAM implementation does not permit
# 		distinguishing "PW could not be checked" (due to failed permissions to read /etc/shadow) from "PW did not match".
#
# 		IF your system uses /etc/shadow, you may be able to enable access to it by MySQL using thsi method (assuming that
# 			the MySQL server is run from the mysql system account):
#
# 		1. Create a shadow group in /etc/group
#
# 		2. Add the mysql user to the shadow group in /etc/group.
#
# 		3. Assign /etc/group to the shadow group and enable the group read permission:
#
# 			chgrp shadow /etc/shadow
# 			chmod g+r /etc/shadow
#
# 		4. Restart the MySQL server
#
# LDAP Authentication without Proxy Users
#
# This authentication scenario uses PAM only to check LDAP user login names and passwords.
#
# Every external user permitted to connect to MySQL Server should have a matching MySQL account that is defined
# to use external PAM authentication.
#
# 	1. Verify that LDAP authentication in PAM permits you to log in as antonio with password verysecret
#
# 	2. Set up PAM to authenticate the mysql service through LDAP by creating a file named /etc/pam.d/mysql.
#
# 		The file contents are system dependent, so check existing login-related files in the /etc/pam.d direcotry
# 		to see what they look like. On Linux, the mysql file might look like this:
#
# 			#%PAM-1.0
# 			auth 			required 		pam_ldap.so
# 			account 		required 		pam_ldap.so
#
# 		If PAM object files have a suffix different from .so on your system, substitute the correct suffix.
#
# 		The PAM file format might differ on some systems.
#
# 	3. MySQL account creation and connecting to the server is the same as described in UNIX PW AUTHENTICATION WITHOUT PROXY USERS.
#
# UNIX PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION WITH PROXY USERS AND GROUP MAPPING
#
# The authentication scheme described here uses Proxying and group mapping to map connecting MySQL users who authenticate using
# PAM onto other MySQL accounts that define different sets of privileges.
#
# USers do not connect directly through the accounts that define the privileges.
#
# INstead, they connect through a default proxy user authenticated using PAM, such that all
# the external logins are mapped to the MySQL accounts that holds the privileges.
#
# Any user who connects is mapped to one of those MySQL accounts, the privileges for which
# determines the database operations permitted to the external user.
#
# The procedure shown here uses Unix password authentication. To use LDAP instead, see earlier.
#
# 1. Verify that Unix authentication in PAM permits you to log in as antonio with password verysecret and that
# 		antonio is a member of the root of users group.
#
# 2. Set up PAM to authenticate the mysql service. Put the following in /etc/pam.d/mysql:
#
# 		#%PAM-1.0
# 		auth 				include 			password-auth
# 		account 			include 			password-auth
#
# 		For Gentoo Linux, use system-login rather than password-auth.
# 		For macOS, use login rather than password-auth.
#
# 		The PAM file format might differ on some systems. For example, on Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems,
# 		use these file contents instead:
#
# 			@include common-auth
# 			@include common-account
# 			@include common-session-noninteractive
#
# 3. Create a default proxy user (''@'') that maps the external PAM users to the proxied accounts.
#
# 		It maps external users from the root PAM group to the developer MySQL account and the external users
# 		from the users PAM group to the data_entry MySQL account:
#
# 			CREATE USER ''@'' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam AS 'mysql, root=developer, users=data_entry';
#
# The mapping list following the service name is required when you set up proxy users. Otheriwse, the plugin cannot
# 	tell how to map the name of PAM groups to the proper proxied user name.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		IF your MySQL installation has anon users, they might conflict with the defualt proxy user.
#
# 4. Create the proxied accounts that will be used to access the database:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'developer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'very secret PW';
# 		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydevdb.* TO 'developer'@'localhost';
# 		CREATE USER 'data_entry'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'very secret PW';
# 		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydb.* TO 'data_entry'@'localhost';
#
# If you do not let anyone know the PWs for these accs, other user cannot use them to 
# cornect directly to the MySQL server.
#
# iNStead, it is expected that users will authneticate using PAM and that they will use the
# developer or data_entry account by proxy on their PAM group.
#
# 5. Grant the PROXY privilege to the proxy account for the proxied accounts:
#
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'developer'@'localhost' TO ''@'';
# 		GRANT PROXY ON 'data_entry'@'localhost' TO ''@'';
#
# 6. Connect to the MySQL server using the mysql command-line client. For example:
#
# 		mysql --user=antonio --password --enable-cleartext-plugin mydb
# 		Enter password: verysecret
#
# The server authenticates the connection using the ''@'' account.
#
# THe privileges antonio will have dependson what PEM groups he is a member of.
#
# If antonio is a member of  the root PAM group, the PAM plugin maps root to the developer 
# MySQL user name and returns that name to the server.
#
# The server verifies that ''@'' has the PROXY privilege for developer and permits the connection.
# THe following queyr should return output as shown:
#
# SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
# +-----------------------------------------------------+
# | USER() 			   | CURRENT_USER() 	   | @@proxy_user|
# +-----------------------------------------------------+
# | antonio@localhost| developer@localhost| ''@'' 		  |
# +-----------------------------------------------------+
#
# THis demonstrates that anotnio uses the privielges granted to the developer MySQl account, and that proxying
# occurred through the  default proxy user account.
#
# If antonio is not a member of the root PAM group but is a member of the users
# group, a similar process occurs, but the plugin maps user group membership to the data_entry MySQL user name and
# returns that name to the server.
#
# In this case, antonio uses the privileges of the data_entry MySQL account:
#
# SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
# +-------------------------------------------------------+
# | 	USER() 			| 		CURRENT_USER()  |  @@proxy_user| 		
# +-------------------------------------------------------+
# | antonio@localhost| data_entry@localhost|''@'' 			 |
# +-------------------------------------------------------+
#
# NOTE:
#
# THe client-side mysql_clear_password plugin with which the server-side PAM plugin communicates sends the password
# to the MySQL server in clear text so it can be passed to PAM.
#
# This is necessary to use the server-side PAM library, but may be a security problem in some configs.
#
# These measures minimize hte risk:
#
# 		) To make inadvertent use of the mysql_clear_password plugin less likely, MySQL clients must explicitly enable it;
# 			For example, with the --enable-cleartext-plugin option.
#
# 		) To avoid password exposure with the mysql_clear_password plugin enabled, MySQL clients should connect to
# 			the MySQL server using a secure connection.
#
# PAM PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION DEBUGGING
#
# The PAM authentication plugin checks at intiailizaiton time whether the AUTHENTICATION_PAM_LOG envrionment value is set
# (the value does not matter).
#
# IF so, the plugin enables logging of diagnostic messages to the standard output.
#
# These messages may be helpful for debugging PAM-related problems that occur when the plugin performs
# authentication.
#
# SOme messages include reference to PAM plugin source files and line numbers, which enables plugin actions to be tied more closely
# to the location in the code where they occur.
#
# WINDOWS PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		WIndows pluggable authentication is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product.
#
# MySQL Enterprise Edition for Windows supports an authentication method that performs external authentication on Windows,
# 	enabling MySQL Server to use Native Windows services to authenticate client connections.
#
# Users who have logged in to Windows can connect from MySQL client programs to the server based on the information in the
# environment without specifying an additonal PW.
#
# The client and server exchanges data packets in the authentication handshake. As a result of this exchange, the server
# creates a security context object that represents the identity of the client in the Windows OS.
#
# This identity includes the name of the client account.
#
# WIndows pluggable authentication uses the identity of the client to check whether it is a given account or a member of a group.
# By default, negotiation uses Kerberos to atuehtnicate, then NTLM if Kerberos is unavailable.
#
# Windows pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:
#
# 		) External authentication: Windows authentication enables MySQL Server to accept connections from users defined outside the
# 			MySQL grant tables who ahve logged in to Windows.
#
# 		) Proxy user support: Windows authentication can return to MySQL a user name different from the client user.
#
# 			THis means that the plugin can return the MySQL user that defines the privileges the external Windows-authenticated
# 			user should have.
#
# 			FOr example, a user named joe can connect and have the privileges of the user named developer.
#
# The following tbale shows the plugin and library file names. The file must be located in the directory named by the
# plugin_dir system varaible.
#
# PLUGIN AND LIBRARY NAMES FOR WINDOWS AUTHENTICATION
#
# Plugin or File 			Plugin or File name
# 
# Server-side plugin 	authentication_windows
#
# Client-side plugin 	authentication_windows_client
#
# Library file 			authentication_windows.dll
#
# The library file includes only the server-side plugin. THe client-side plugin is built into the libmysqlclient client library.
#
# The server-side Windows authentication plugin is included only in MySQL Enterprise Edition.
# It is not included in MySQL community distributions.
#
# The client-side plugin is included in all distirbutions, including community distribs. This permits clients from any distrib
# to connect to a server that has the server-side plugin loaded.
#
# The Windows authentication plugin is supported on any version of Windows supported by MySQL 8.0
#
# INSTALLING WINDOWS PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# This section describes how ot install the Windows auth plugin. 
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by the
# plugin_dir SYSTEM VARIABLE).
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# To load the plugin at server startup, use the --plugin-load-add option to name the library file that contains it.
# WIth this plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the server starts.
#
# For example, put these lines in the server my.cnf file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		plugin-load-add=authentication_windows.dll
#
# AFter modifying my.cnf, restart the server to cause the new settins to tkae effect.
#Q
# Alternatively, to register the plugin at runtime, use this statement:
#
# INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_windows SONAME 'authentication_windows.dll';
#
# INSTALL_PLUGIN loads the plugin immediately, and also registers it in the mysql.plugins system table to cause the
# server to load it for each subsequent normal startup.
#
# TO verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement
#
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
# 		FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
# 		WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%windows%';
# 		+----------------------------------------------+
# 		| PLUGIN_NAME 		        | PLUGIN_STATUS 	  |
# 		+----------------------------------------------+
# 		| authentication_windows  | ACTIVE 				  |
# 		+----------------------------------------------+
#
# If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# UNINSTALLING WINDOWS PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The method used to uninstall the Windows authentication plugin depends  on how you installed it:
#
# 		) If you installed the plugin at server startup using a --plugin-load-add option, restart the server without the option
#
# 		) If you installed the plugin at runtime using INSTALL_PLUGIN, it remains installed across server restarts. to unstainll it, use UNINSTALL_PLUGIN:
#
# 			UNINSTALL PLUGIN authentication_windows;
#
# In addition, remove any startup options that set Windows plugin-related System Variables
#
# USING WINDOWS PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The Windows authentication plugin supports the use of MySQL accounts such that users who have logged in to Windows can connect to the 
# MySQL server without having to specify an additional PW.
#
# IT is assumed that hte server is runnning with the server-side plugin enabled.
#
# Once the DBA has enabled the server-side plugin and set up accounts to use it, clients can connect using those accounts
# with no other setup required on their part.
#
# To refer to the Windows authentication plugin in the IDENTIFIED WITH clause of a CREATE_USER statement, use the name
# authentication_windows.
#
# Suppose that the Windows uses Rafal and Tasha should be permitted to connect to MySQL, as well as any users in the Administrators or Power Users group.
#
# To set this up, create a MySQL account named sql_admin that uses the Windows plugin for authentication:
#
# 		CREATE USER sql_admin IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows AS 'Rafal, Tasha, Administration, "Power Users"';
#
# The plugin name is authentication_windows.
#
# the string following the AS Keyword is the authentication string. It specifies that hte Windows user named Rafal or Tasha are permitted
# to authenticate to the server as the MysQL user sql_admin, as are any Windows users in the Administrators or Power Users group.
#
# The latter group name contains a space, so it must be quoted with double quote chars.
#
# After you create the sql_admin account, a user who has logged in to WIndows can attempt to connect to the server using that account:
#
# 		mysql --user=sql_admin
#
# no password is required here. The authentication_windows plugin uses the WIndows security API to check which Windows user is connecting.
#
# If that user is named Rafal or Tasha, or is in the Administrators or Power Users group, the server grants access and the client
# is authenticated as sql_admin and has whatever privileges are granted to the sql_admin account.
#
# Otherwise, the server denies access.
#
# Authentication string syntax for the Windows authentication plugin follows these rules:
#
# 		) The string consists of one or more user mappings separated by commas.
#
# 		) Each user mapping associates a Windows user or group name with a MySQL user name:
#
# 			win_user_or_group_name=mysql_user_name
# 			win_user_or_group_name
#
#			For the latter syntax, with no mysql_user_name value given, the implicit value is the MySQL user created by the CREATE_USER statement.
#
# 			Thus, these statements are equivalent:
#
# 				CREATE USER sql_admin IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows AS 'Rafal, Tasha, Administrators, "Power Users"';
#
# 				CREATE USER sql_admin IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows AS 'Rafal=sql_admin, Tasha=sql_admin, Administrators=sql_admin, "Power Users"=sql_admin';
#
# 		) Each blackslash ('\') in a value must be doubled becuase backslash is the escape char in MySQL strings.
#
# 		) Leading and trailing spaces not inside " marks are ignored
#
# 		) Unuquoted win_user_or_group_name and mysql_user_name values can contain anything except equal signs, comma or spaces.
#
# 		) If a win_user_or_group_name and/or mysql_user_name value is quoted with ", everything between the "" marks is part of the value.
# 			This is necessary, for example, if the name contains space characters.
#
# 			All chars within " are legal except " and \, to include those, escape them with \
#
# 		) win_user_or_group_name values use conventional syntax for Windows principals, either local or in a domain.
#
# 			Examples (note the doubling of backslashes):
#
# 				domain\\user
# 				.\\user
# 				domain\\group
# 				.\\group
# 				BUILTIN\\WellKnownGroup
#
# WHen invoked by the server to authenticate a client, the plugin scans the authentication string left to right for a user or group match
# to the WIndows user.
#
# If there is a match, the plugin returns the corresponding mysql_user_name to the MySQL server. If there is no match, authentication fails.
#
# A user name match takes preference over a group name match. Suppose that the Windows user named win_user is a member of win_group and the
# authentication string looks like this:
#
# 		'win_group = sql_user1, win_user = sql_user2'
#
# When win_user connects to the MySQL server, there is a match both to win_group and to win_user.
#
# The plugin authenticates the user as sql_user2 because the more specific user match takes precedence over the group match,
# even if the group is listed as the first param in the authentication string.
#
# Windows authentication always works for connections from the same computer on which the server is running.
#
# For cross-computer connections, both computers must be registered with Windows Active Directory.
#
# If they are in the same Windows domain, it is unnecessary to specify a domain name.
#
# It is also possible to permit connections from a different domain, as in this example:
#
# 		CREATE USER sql_accounting IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows AS 'SomeDomain\\Accounting';
#
# Here SomeDomain is the name of the other domain. The \ is doubled because it is the MySQL escape char within strings.
#
# MySQL supports the concept of proxy users whereby a client can connect and authenticate to the MySQL server using one account
# but while connected has the privileges of another account.
#
# Suppose that you want Windows users to connect using a single user name but be mapped based on their Windows user and group
# names onto specific MySQL accounts as follows:
#
# 		) The local_user and MyDomain\domain_user local and domain Windows users should map to the local_wlad MySQL account.
#
# 		) Users in the MyDomain\Developers domain group should map to the local_dev MySQL account.
#
# 		) Local machine administrators should map to the local_admin MySQL account.
#
# To set this up, create a proxy account for WIndows users to connect to, and configure this account so taht users and groups
# map to the appropriate MySQL accounts (local_wlad, local_dev, local_admin).
#
# In addition, grant the MySQL accounts the privileges appropriate to the operations they need to perform.
#
# The following instructions use win_proxy as the proxy account, and local_wlad, local_dev and local_admin as the proxied accounts.
#
# 1. Create the proxy MySQL account:
#
# 		CREATE USER win_proxy IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows AS 'local_user = local_wlad, MyDomain\\domain_user = local_wlad,
# 																							 MyDomain\\Developers = local_dev, BUILTIN\\Administrators = local_admin';
#
# 		NOTE : If your MySQL installation has anon users, they might conflict with the default proxy user.
#
# 2. For proxying to work, the proxied accounts must exist, so create them:
#
# 		CREATE USER local_wlad IDENTIFIED BY 'wlad_pass';
# 		CREATE USER local_dev IDENTIFIED BY 'dev_pass';
# 		CREATE USER local_admin IDENTIFIED BY 'admin_pass';
#
# 		If you do not let anyone know the passwords for these accounts, other users cannot use them to connect directly to the MySQL server.
#
# 		You should also issue GRANT statements (not shown) that grant each proxied account the privileges it needs.
#
# 3. The proxy account must have the PROXY privilege for each of the proxied accounts:
#
# 		GRANT PROXY ON local_wlad TO win_proxy;
# 		GRANT PROXY ON local_dev TO win_proxy;
# 		GRANT PROXY ON local_admin TO win_proxy;
#
# Now the Windows users local_user and MyDomain\domain_user can connect to the MySQL server as win_proxy and when authenticated
# have the privileges of the account given in the authentication string - in this case, local_wlad.
#
# A user in the MyDomain\Developers group who connects as win_proxy has the privileges of the local_dev account.
#
# A user in the BUILTIN\Administrators group has privileges of the local_admin account.
#
# To configure authentication so that all Windows users who do not have their own MySQL account go through a proxy account,
# substitute the default proxy user (''@'') for win_proxy in teh preceding example.
#
# To use the Windows authentication plugin with Connector/NET connection strings in Connector/NET 6.4.4 and higher, see the instructions.
#
# Additional control over the Windows authentication plugin is provided by the authentication_windows_use_principal_name and
# authentication_windows_log_level SYSTEM VARIABLES.
#
# LDAP PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# NOTE: LDAP pluggable authentication is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product.
#
# MySQL Enterprise Edition supports an authetication method that enables MySQL Server to use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
# to authenticate MySQL users by accessing directory services such as X.500
#
# MySQL uses LDAP to fetch user, credential and group information.
#
# LDAP pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:
#
# 		) External authentication: LDAP authentication enables MySQL Server to accept connections from users defined outside the MySQL grant tables in LDAP directories.
#
# 		) Proxy user support: LDAP authentication can return to MySQL a user name different from the login user, based on the LDAP group of the external user.
#
# 		This means that an LDAP plugin can return the MySQL user that defines the privileges the external LDAP-authenticated user should have.
#
# 		For example, an LDAP user named joe can connect and have the privileges of the MySQL user named developer, if the LDAP group for joe is developer.
#
# 		) Security: Using TLS, connections to the LDAP server can be secure.
#
# The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The file name suffix might differ on your system.
#
# The files must be located in the directory named by the plugin_dir system variable.
#
# PLUGIN AND LIBRARY NAMES FOR LDAP AUTHENTICATION
#
# Plugin or File 					Plugin or File Name
# Server-side plugin names 	authentication_ldap_sasl, authentication_ldap_simple
#
# Client-side plugin names 	authentication_ldap_sasl_client, mysql_clear_password
#
# Library file names 			authentication_ldap_sasl.so, authentication_ldap_sasl_client.so, authentication_ldap_simple.so
#
# The library files include only the authentication_ldap_XXX plugins. The client-side mysql_clear_password plugin is built into the
# libmysqlclient client library.
#
# There are two server-side LDAP plugins, each of which works with a specific client-side plugin:
#
# 	) The server-side authentication_ldap_simple plugin performs simple LDAP authentication.
#
# 		For connections by accounts that use this plugin, client programs use the client-side mysql_clear_password plugin, which sends the
# 		PW to the server in clear text.
#
# 		No PW hashing or encryption is used, so a secure connection between the MySQL client and the server is recommended to prevent PW exposure
#
# ) The server-side authentication_ldap_sasl plugin performs SASL-based LDAP authentication.
#
# 	For connections by accounts that use this plugin, client programs use the client-side authentication_ldap_sasl_client plugin.
#
# The client-side and server-side SASL LDAP plugins use SASL messages for secure transmission of credentials within the LDAP protocol,
# to avoid sending the clear-text PW between the MySQL client and server.
#
# NOTE:
# 		If your system supports PAM and permits LDAP as a PAM authentication method, another way to use LDAP for MySQL user authentication
# 		is to use the server-side authentication_pam plugin.
#
# PREREQUISITES FOR LDAP PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# To use LDAP pluggable authentication for MySQL, these prerequisites must be satisfied:
#
# 		) An LDAP server must be available for the LDAP authentication plugins to communicate with.
#
# 		) LDAP users to be authenticated by MySQL must be present in teh directory managed by the LDAP server.
#
# 		) An LDAP client library must be available on systems where the server-side authentication_ldap_sasl or
# 			authentication_ldap_simple plugins is used.
#
# 			Currently, supported libraries are the Windows native LDAP library or the OpenLDAP library on non-Windows systems.
#
# 		) To use SASL-based LDAP authentication:
#
# 			) The LDAP server must be configured to communicate with a SASL server.
#
# 			) A SASL client library must be available on systems where the client-side authentication_ldap_sasl_client plugin is used.
#
# 				Currently, the only supported library is the Cyrus SASL library.
#
# HOW LDAP AUTHENTICATION OF MYSQL USERS WORKS
#
# This section provides a general overview of how MySQL and LDAP work together to authenticate MySQL users.
#
# For example showing how to set up MySQL accounts to use specific LDAP authentication plugins, see later.
#
# The client connects to the MySQL server, providing the MySQL client user name and the LDAP password:
#
# 		) For simple LDAP authentication, the client-side and server-side plugins communicate the plugin in clear text.
#
# 		) For SASL-based LDAP authentication, the client-side and server-side plugins use SASL messages for secure transmission of credentials 
# 			within the LDAP protocol, to avoid sending the clear-text password between the MySQL client and server.
#
# If the client user name and host name match no MySQL account, the connection is rejected.
#
# If there is a matching MySQL account, authentication against LDAP occurs. The LDAP server looks for an entry matching the user
# and authenticates the entry against the password:
#
# 		) If the MySQL account names and the LDAP user distinguished name (DN), LDAP authentication uses that value and the 
# 			LDAP password provided by the client.
#
# 			(To associate an LDAP user DN with a MySQL account, include a BY clause in the CREATE_USER statement that creates the account)
#
# 		) If the MySQL account names no LDAP user DN, LDAP authentication uses the user name and LDAP password provided by the client.
#
# 			In this case, the authentication plugin first binds to the LDAP server using the root DN and password as credentials to find
# 			the user DN based on the client user name, then authenticates the user DN against the LDAP password.
#
# 			The bind using the root credentials fails if teh root DN and password are set but to incorrect values, or are empty
# 			(not set) and the LDAP server does not permit anon connections.
#
# If the LDAP server finds no match or multiple matches, authentication fails and the client connection is rejected.
#
# If the LDAP serer finds a single match, LDAP authentication succeeds (assuming that the PW is correct), the LDAP server returns
# the LDAP entry, and the authetication plugin determines the name of the authenticated user based on that entry:
#
# 		) If the LDAP entry has a group attribute (by default, the cn attribute) - the plugin returns its value as the authenticated user name.
#
# 		) If the LDAP entry has no group attribute, the authentication plugin returns the client user name as the authenticated user name.
#
# The MySQL server compares the client user name with the authenticated user name to determine whether proxying occurs for teh client session:
#
# 		) If the names are the same, no proxying occurs: The MySQL account matching the client user name is used for privilege checking.
#
# 		) If the names differ, proxying occurs: MySQL looks for an account matching the authenticated user name.
#
# 			That account becomes the proxied user, which is used for privilege checking.
# 			The MySQL account that matched the client user name is treated as the external proxy user.
#
# INSTALLING LDAP PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATON
#
# This section describes how to install the LDAP authentication plugins. 
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library files must be located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by the plugin_dir system variable)
# 
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# The server-side plugin library file base names are authentication_ldap_sasl and authentication_ldap_simple.
#
# The file name suffix differs per platform (for example, .so for Unix and Unix-like systems, .dll for windows)
#
# To laod the plugins at server startup, use --plugin-load-add options to name the library file that contain them.
# With this plugin-loading method, the options must be given each time the server starts.
#
# ALso, specify values for any plugin-provided System variables you wish to configure.
#
# Each server-side LDAP plugin exposes a set of system variables that enable its operation to be configured.
#
# Setting most of these is optional, but you must set the variables that specify the LDAP server host (so the plugin knows where to connect)
# and base distinguished names for LDAP bind operations (to limit the scope of searches and obtain faster searches). 
#
# For more about hte LDAP System variables, they are covered later.
#
# To load the plugins and set the LDAP server host and base distinguished name for LDAP bind operations, put lines such
# as these in your my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix accordingly):
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		plugin-load-add=authentication_ldap_sasl.so
# 		authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host=127.0.0.1
# 		authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
# 		plugin-load-add=authentication_ldap_simple.so
# 		authentication_ldap_simple_server_host=127.0.0.1
# 		authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
#
# After modifying my.cnf, restart the server to cause the new settings to take effect.
#
# Alternatively, to register the plugins at runtime, use these statements (adjust the .so suffix as necesary):
#
# 		INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_sasl SONAME 'authentication_ldap_sasl.so';
# 		INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_simple SONAME 'authentication_ldap_simple.so';
#
# INSTALL_PLUGIN loads the plugin immediately, and also registers it in the mysql.plugins system table to cause the
# server to load it for each subsequent normal startup.
#
# After installing the plugins at runtime, their system variables become available and you can add settings for them
# to your my.cnf file to configure the plugins for subsequent restarts.
#
# For example:
#
# [mysqld]
# authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host=127.0.0.1
# authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
# authentication_ldap_simple_server_host=127.0.0.1
# authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
#
# After modifying my.cnf, restart the server to cause the new settings to take effect.
#
# To verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# For example:
#
#
# SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%ldap%';
# +---------------------------------------------+
# | PLUGIN_NAME 						| PLUGIN_STATUS|
# +------------------------------+--------------+
# | authentication_ldap_sasl 		| ACTIVE 		| 
# | authentication_ldap_simple 	| ACTIVE 		| 
# +------------------------------+--------------+
#
# If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR SELINUX:
#
#
# 		ON systems running EL6 or EL that have SELinux enabled, changes to the SELinux policy are required to enable
# 		the MySQL LDAP plugins to communicate with the LDAP service:
#
# 			1. Create a file mysqlldap.te with these contents:
#
# 				module mysqlldap 1.0:
#
# 				require {
# 							type ldap_port_t;
# 							type mysqld_t;
# 							class tcp_socket name_connect;
# 				}
#
# 				#================= mysqld_t =====================
#
# 				allow mysqld_t ldap_port_t:tcp_socket name_connect;
#
# 			2. COmpile the security policy module into binary representation
#
# 				checkmodule -M -m mysqlldap.te -o mysqlldap.mod
#
# 			3. Create an SELinux policy module package:
#
# 				semodule_package -m mysqlldap.mod -o mysqlldap.pp
#
# 			4. install teh module package:
#
# 				semodule -i mysqlldap.pp
#
# 			5. When the SELinux policy changes has been made, restart the MySQL server:
#
# 				service mysqld restart
#
# UNINSTALLING LDAP PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# This section describes how to enable MySQL accounts to connect to the MySQL servers using LDAP pluggable authentcation.
#
# It is assumed that hte servers is running with the appropriate server-side plugins enabled, and that the
# appropriate client-side plugins are available on the client host.
#
# This section does not describe LDAP configuration or administration. It is assumed that oyu are fmiliar with such.
#
# There are two server-side LDAP plugins, each of which works with a specific client-side plugin:
#
# 		) The server-side authentication_ldap_simple plugin performs simple LDAP authentication.
#
# 			For connections by accounts that uses this plugin, client programs use the client-side mysql_clear_password plugin,
# 			which sends the PW to the server in clear text.
#
# 			No password hashing or encryption is used, so to secure connections between the MySQL client and server is recommended to prevent PW exposure.
#
# 		) The server-side authentication_ldap_sasl plugin performs SASL-based LDAP authentication.
# 
# 			For connections by accounts that use this plugin, client programs use the client-side authentication_ldap_sasl_client
# 			plugin.
#
# 			The client-side and server-side SASL LDAP plugins use SASL messages for secure transmission of
# 			credentials within the LDAP protocol, to avoid sending hte clear-text password between the MySQL client and server.
#
# Overall reuqirements for LDAP authentication of MySQL Users:
#
# 		) There must be an LDAP directory entry for each user to be authenticated.
#
# 		) THere msut be a MySQL user account that specifies a server-side LDAP authentication plugin and optionally
# 			names the associated LDAP users distinguished name (DN).
#
# 			(To associate an LDAP user DN with a MySQL account, include a BY clause in the CREATE_USER statement htat creates
# 			the Acc)
#
# 			IF an account names no LDAP string, LDAP authentication uses the user name specified by the client to find the LDAP entry.
#
# 		) Client programs connect using the connection method approriate for the server-side authentication plugin the MySQl account uses.
#
# 			For LDAP authentication, connections require the MysQl user name and LDAP password.
#
# 			In adddition, for accounts that use the server-side authentication_ldap_simple plugin, invoke
# 			client programs with the --enable-cleartext-plugin option to eanble the client-side mysql_clear_password plugin.
#
# The instructions here assume the following scenario:
#
# 		) MySQL users betsy and boris authenticate to the LDAP entries for betsy_ldap and boris_ldap, respectively.
#
# 			(It is not necessary that the MySQL and LDAP user names differ, but using differnet names here helps clairy whether
# 				an operation context is MySQL or LDAP)
#
# 		) LDAP entries use the uid attribute to specify user names. (This may vary depending on LDAP server. Some LDAP servers use
# 			the cn attribute for user names rather than uid)
#
# 		) These LDAP entries are available in the directory managed by the LDAP server, to provide distinguished name values that uniquely
# 			identify each other:
#
# 				uid=betsy_ldap, pwd=pwd1, ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
# 				uid=boris_ldap, pwd=pwd2, ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
#
# 		) CREATE_USER statements that create MySQL accounts name an LDAP user in the BY clause, to indicate which 
# 			LDAP entry teh MySQL account authenticates against.
#
# The instructions for setting up an account that uses LDAP authentication dependso n which server-side LDAP plugins is used.
#
# SIMPLE LDAP AUTHENTICATION
#
# To configure a MYSQL account for simple LDAP authentication, the CREATE_USER statement should specify the 
# authentication_ldap_simple plugin, and optionally name the LDAP user distinguished name (DN):
#
# 		CREATE USER user IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple [BY 'LDAP user DN'];
#
# Suppose that a MySQL user betsy has this entry in the LDAP directory:
#
# 		uid=betsy_ldap,pwd=pwd1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
#
# Then the statement to create hte MySQL account for besty woudl look like this:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'betsy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple BY 'uid=betsy_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com';
#
# The authentication string specified in teh BY clause does not include the LDAP password.
# That msut be provided by the client user at connection time.
#
# Clients ocnnect to the MySQL server by providing the MySQL user name and LDAP password, and by enabling the client-side
# mysql_clear_password plugin:
#
# 		mysql --user=betsy --password --enable-cleartext-plugin
# 		Enter Password: pwd1 (betsy_ldap LDAP password)
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The client-side mysql_clear_password plugin with which the server-side authentication_ldap_simple plugin
# 		communicates sends the password to the MySQL server in clear text so it can be passed as is to the LDAP server.
#
# 		This is necessary to use the server-side LDAP library without SASL, but may be a security problem in some configurations.
#
# 		These measures minimize the risk:
#
# 			) To make inadvertent use of the mysql_clear_password plugin less likely, MySQL clients must explicitly enable it.
# 				For example, with the --enable-cleartext-plugin option.
#
# 			) To avoid password exposure with hte mysql_clear_password plugin enabled, MySQL clients should connect to the MySQL
# 				server using a secure connection.
#
# The authentication process is as follows:
#
# 1. The client-side plugin sends besty and pwd1 as the client user name and LDAP pw to the mysql server
#
# 2. The connection attempt matches the 'betsy'@'localhost' account. 
#
# 		The server-side LDAP plugin finds that this account has an authentication string of 'uid=betsy_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'
# 		to name the LDAP user DN.
#
# 		The plugin sends this string and hte LDAP password to the LDAP server.
#
# 3. The LDAP server finds the LDAP entry for betsy_ldap and the password matches, so LDAP authentication succeeds.
#
# 4. The LDAP entry has no group attribute, so the server-side plugin returns the client user name(betsy) as the authenticated user.
#
# 		This is the same user name supplied by the client, so no proxying occurs nad the clietn uses the 'betsy'@'localhost' account for privilege checking.
#
# Had the matching LDAP entry contained a group attribute, that attribute value would have been authenticated user name and, if the value differed from Betsy,
# proxying would have occurred.
#
# For examples that use the group attribute, see LDAP Authentication with Proxying.
#
# Had the CREATE_USER statement contained no BY clause to specify the betsy_ldap LDAP distinguished name, authentication
# attempts would use the user name provided by the client (in this case, betsy).
#
# In the absence of an LDAP entry for betsy, authentication would fail.
#
# SASL-Based LDAP Authentication
#
# To configure a MySQL account for SASL LDAP authentication, the CREATE_USER statement should specify the authentication_ldap_sasl plugin,
# and optionally name the LDAP user distinguished name (DN):
#
# 		CREATE USER user IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl [BY 'LDAP user DN'];
#
# Suppose that a MySQL user boris has this entry in the LDAP directory:
#
# 		uid=boris_ldap,pwd=pwd2,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
#
# Then the statement to create the MySQL account for boris looks like this:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'boris'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl BY 'uid=boris_ldap, ou=People, dc=example, dc=com';
#
# The authentication string specified in the BY clause does not include the LDAP pw.
#
# That msut be provided by the user at connection time.
#
# Clients connect to the Mysql server by providing the MySQL user name and teh LDAP PW:
#
# mysql --user=boris --password
#
# FOr hte server-side authentication_ldap_sasl plugin, clients use the client-side authentication_ldap_sasl_client plugin.
#
# If a client program does not find the client-side plugin, specify a --plugin-dir opton that names hte directory where
# the plugin library file is installed.
#
# The authentication process for boris is similar to htat previously described for betsy with simple LDAP authentication, except that
# the Client-side and server-side SASL LDAP plugins use SASL messages for secure transmission of credentials within the LDAP
# protocol, to avoid sending the clear-text PW between the MySQL client and server.
#
# LDAP Authentication User DN Suffixes
#
# LDAP authentication plugins permit the authentication string that provides user DN informatio nto begin with a + char.
#
# in the abseence of this char, the authentication string value is treated as is without modification.
#
# If the authentication string begins with +, the plugin constructs the full user DN value from the account user name as the
# cn attribute value, together with the authentication string (with the + removed).
#
# The authentication string is stored as given in the mysql.user system table, with the full user DN constructed on the fly before
# authentication.
#
# this account authentication string does not have + at the beginning, so it is taken as teh full user DN:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'admin' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple BY "cn=admin,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com";
#
# This account authentication string does have a + at hte start, so it is taken as just part of the full user DN:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'accounting' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple BY "+ou=People,dc=example,dc=com";
#
# IN this case, the full user DN is constructed using accounting as the cn attribute together with the authetnication string to yield:
#
# "cn=accounting,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
#
# For acount names that include a host name part, the user name is tkaen from the user name sent by the client.
#
# (effectively, this is the user name part of the account name, ignoring the host name part)
#
# LDAP Authentication with Proxying
#
# The authentication scheme described here uses proxying based on LDAP group attribute values to map
# connecting MySQL users who authenticate using LDAP onto other MysQL accounts that define different sets of privileges.
#
# USers do not connect directly through the accounts that define the privileges.
#
# Instead, they connect through a default proxy user authenticated with LDAP, such that all external logins are mapped to the
# MySQL accounts taht hold the privileges.
#
# any user who connects is mapped to one of those MySQL accounts, the privileges for which determines the database operatons
# permitted to the external user.
#
# The instructions here assume the following scenario:
#
# 		) LDAP entries use the uid and cn attributes to specify user name and group values, respectively.
#
# 			To use different user and group attribute names, set the appropriate system variables to configure the plugin:
#
# 				) For authentication_ldap_simple: Set authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr and authentication_ldap_simple_group_search_attr
#
# 				) For authentication_ldap_sasl: Set authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr and authentication_ldap_sasl_group_search_attr
#
# 		) These LDAP entries are available in the directory managed by the LDAP server, to provide distinguished name values that uniquely identify each user:
#
# 			uid=basha,pwd=pwd3,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com,cn=accounting
# 			ui=basil,pwd=pwd4,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com,cn=front_office
#
# 			The group attribute values will become the authenticated user names, so they name the proxied accounts, accounting and front_office.
#
# 		) The examples assume use of SASL LDAP authentication. Make the appropriate adjustments for simple LDAP authentication.
#
# Create hte default proxy MySQL account:
#
# 		CREATE USER ''@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl;
#
# The proxy account definiton has no BY 'auth_string' clause to name an LDAP user DN, so that when the client connects, the client user name
# is used as the LDAP User name to search for.
#
# The matching LDAP entry is expected to include a group attribute naming the proxied MySQL account that defines the privileges
# the client should have.
#
# Note:
#
# 		IF your MySQL installation has anonymous users, they might conflict with the default proxy user.
# 		
#
# Create hte proxied accounts and grant their privileges:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'accounting'@'localhost' ACCOUNT LOCK;
# 		CREATE USER 'front_office'@'localhost' ACCOUNT LOCK;
#
# 		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES 
# 			ON accountingdb.*
# 			TO 'accounting'@'localhost';
# 		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
# 			ON frontdb.*
# 			TO 'front_office'@'localhost';
#
# Grant hte PROXY privilege to the proxy account for the proxied accounts:
#
# 		GRANT PROXY
# 			ON 'accounting'@'localhost'
# 			TO ''@'%';
# 		GRANT PROXY
# 			ON 'front_office'@'localhost'
# 			TO ''@'%';
#
# Connect to the MySQL 	server as basha using the mysql command-line client:
#
# 		mysql --user=basha --password
#
# The server authenticates the connection using the ''@'%' account, for client user Basha.
# The matching LDAP entry has group attribute cn=accounting, so accounting becomes the authenticated user.
#
# THis differs from the client user name basha, with the result that basha is treated as a proxy for accounting and 
# basha assumes the privileges of the accounting account.
#
# The followuing query should return output as shown:
#
# SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
# +------------------------------------------------------+
# | USER() 				| CURRENT_USER()      | @@proxy_user|
# +------------------------------------------------------+
# | basha@localhost 	| accounting@localhost| ''@'%' 		|
# +------------------------------------------------------+
#
# This demonstrates that basha uses the privileges granted to the accounting MYSQL account, and that proxying occurred
# through the default proxy user account.
#
# Now connect as basil instead:
#
# mysql --user=basil --password
# Enter password: pwd4 (basil LDAP password)
#
#
# The authentication process for basil is similar to that previously described for basha.
#
# IN this case, teh amtchign LDAP entry has group attribute cn=front_office.
#
# So, front_office becomes the authenticated user. This differs from the lcient user basil, with the result
# that basil is treated as a proxy for front_office and basil assumes the privileges of the front_office account.
#
# The following query should return output as shown:
#
# SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
# +------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | USER() 					| CURRENT_USER() 					| @@proxy_user |
# +------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | basil@localhost 		| front_office@localhost 		| ''@'%' 		|
# +------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
#
# This demosntrates that basil uses the privileges granted to the front_office MySQL account.
# (i.e proxying through the default proxy user account)
#
# NO-LOGIN PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The mysql_no_login sever-side authentication plugin prevents all client connections to any account that uses it.
#
# USe cases for such a plugin includes proxied accounts that should never permit direct login but are accessed
# only through proxy accounts and accounts that must be able to execute stored programs and views with elevated
# privileges without exposing those privileges to ordinary users.
#
# THe following table shows the plugin and library file names.

#
# ) Using no-login pluggable authentication
#
# INSTALLING NO-LOGIN PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# TO be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory (the direcotry named by teh
# plugin_dir system variable).
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# The plugin library file base name is mysql_no_login. The file name suffix differs per platform (.so for UNIX based, .dll for Windows)
#
# To load the plugin at server startup, use the --plugin-load-add option to name the library file that contains it.#
# With this plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the server starts.
#
# For example, we can circumvent that and force it by registration to option files:
#
# [mysqld]
# plugin-load-add=mysql_no_login.so (or .dll for Windows)
# 
# After modifying my.cnf, restart the server to cause hte new settings to take effect.
#
# Alternatively, to register the plugin at runtime, use this statement (adjust hte . suffix as needed9:
#
# INSTALL PLUGIN mysql_no_login SONAME 'mysql_no_login.so';
#
# INSTALL_PLUGIN loads the plugin immeadiately, and also registers it in the mysql.plugins system table to cause teh server to load
# it for each subsequent normal startup.
#
# To verify the installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement:
#
# SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS,
# 			FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
# 			WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%login%';

#
# If the plugin fails to initialize - check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# UNINSTALLING NO-LOGIN PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The method used to uninstall the no-login authentication plugin depends on how you install it:
#
# 		) If oyu installed the plugin at server startup using a --plugin-load-add option, restart the server without the option.
#
# 		) If you installed the plugin at runtime using INSTALL_PLUGIN, it remains INSTALLED across server Restarts.
# 			To uninstall it, use UNINSTALL_PLUGIN:
#
# 			UNINSTALL PLUGIN mysql_no_login;
#
# USING NO-LOGIN PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# This section describes how to use the no-login authentication plugin to prevent connections from MySQL client programs to the server.
#
# It is assumed that the server is running with the server-side plugin enabled.
#
# To refer to the no-login authentication plugin in the IDENTIFIED WITH clause of a CREATE_USER statement, use the name mysql_no_login.
#
# An account that authenticates using mysql_no_login may be used as the DEFINER for stored program and view objects.
#
# IF such an object definition also include SQL SECURITY DEFINER, it executes with that accounts privileges.
#
# DBAs cna use this behavior to provide access to confidential or sensitive data that is exposed only
# through well-controlled interfaces.
#
# The following example provides a simple illustration of these principles. It defines an account that does not permit
# client connections, and associates with it a view that exposes only certain columns of the mysql.user system table:
#
# CREATE DATABASE nologindb;
# CREATE USER 'nologin'@'localhost'
# 		IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
#
# GRANT ALL ON nologindb.*
# 		TO 'nologin'@'localhost';
#
# GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user
#		TO 'nologin'@'localhost';
#
# CREATE DEFINER = 'nologin'@'localhost'
# 		SQL SECURITY DEFINER
# 		VIEW nologindb.myview
# 		AS SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
#
# To provide protected access to the view to an ordinary user, do this:
#
# GRANT SELECT ON nologindb.myview TO 'ordinaryuser'@'localhost';
#
# Now the ordinary user can use the view to access the limited information it presents:
#
# SELECT * FROM nologindb.myview;
#
# Attempts by the user to access columns other than those exposed by the view result in an error,
# as do all attempts to select from the view by users not granted access to it.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Because the nologin account cannot be used directly, the operations required to set up objects
# 		must be performed by root or similar accounts with hte privileges required to create the obejcts and set DEFINER values.
#
# An account that authenticates using mysql_no_login may be used as a proxied base user for proxy accounts:
#
# -- Create the proxied account
# CREATE USER 'proxy_base'@'localhost'
# 		IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
#
# -- Grant privileges to proxied account
# GRANT ... TO 'proxy_base'@'localhost';
#
# -- Permit real_user to be proxy for proxied account
# GRANT PROXY ON 'proxy_base'@'localhost'
# 		TO 'real_user'@'localhost';
#
# THis enables clients to access MySQL through the Proxy account (real_user) but not to bypass the proxy mechanism
# by connecting directly as the proxied user (proxy_base).
#
# SOCKET PEER-CREDENTIAL PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The server-side auth_socket authentication plugin authenticates clients that connect from the local host through
# the Unix socket file.
#
# The plugin uses the SO_PEERCRED socket option to obtain information about the user running the client program.
#
# Thus, the plugin can be used only on systems that support the SO_PEERCRED option, such as Linux.
#
# The source code for this plugin can be examined as simple example of demonstrating how to write a loadable authentication plugin.
#
# The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The files msut be located in the directory named by the
# plugin_dir system variable.
#
# PLugin or File 					PLugin or File Name
# Server-side PLugin 			auth_socket
#
# Client-side plugin 			None
#
# Library file  					auth_socket.so
#
# INSTALLING SOCKET PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# This section describes hwo to install the socket authentication plugin.
# 
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory
# (the direcotry named by the plugin_dir system variable).
#
# if necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting hte value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# To load the plugin at server startup, use the --plugin-load-add option to name the library file that contains it.
# With this plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the server starts.
#
# For example, put these lines in the server my.cnf file:
#
# [mysqld]
# plugin-load-add=auth_socket.so
#
# After modifying the file, restart the server to cause the new settings to take effect.
#
# Alternatively, to register the plugin at runtime, use this statement:
#
# 		INSTALL PLUGIN auth_socket SONAME 'auth_socket.so';
#
# INSTALL_PLUGIN loads the plugin immediately, and also registers it n the mysql.plugins system table to cause the
# server to load it for each subsequent normal startup.
#
# TO verify the plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# For example:
#
# SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
# FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
# WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%socket%';
# +--------------------------------------+
# | PLUGIN_NAME 		| PLUGIN_STATUS 	  |

# | auth_socket 		| ACTIVE 			  |
# +--------------------------------------+
#
# If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostics.
#
# UNINSTALLING SOCKET PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# The method used to uninstall the socket authentication plugin depends on how you installed it:
#
# 		) If you installed the plugin at server startup using a --plugin-load-add option ,restart the serer without the option.
#
# 		) If you isntalled the plugin at runtime using INSTALL_PLUGIN, it remains installed across server restarts.
#
# 			To uninstall it, use UNINSTALL_PLUGIN:
#
# 			UNINSTALL PLUGIN auth_socket;
#
# USING SOCKET PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# THe socket plugin checks whether the socket user name (the OS user name) matches the MySQL user name specified
# by the client program to the server.
#
# If the names do not match, the plugin checks whether the socket user name matches the name specified in the 
# authentication_string column of the mysql.user system table row.
#
# IF a match is found, the plugin permits teh connection.
#
# The authentication_string value can be specified using an IDENTIFIED ... AS clause with CREATE_USER through the 
# socket file:
#
# CREATE USER 'valerie'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket;
#
# IF a user on the local host with a login name of stefanie invokes MySQL with the option --user=valerie to connect through
# the socket file, the server uses auth_socket to authenticate the client.
#
# The plugin determines that hte --user option (valerie) differs form the client user's name (Stephanie) and refuses the connection.
#
# If a user named valerie tries the same thing,  the plugin finds taht the user name and the MySQL user name are bot hthe same and permits it.
#
# HOwever, the plugin refuses the connection even for valerie if the connection is made using a different protocol,
# such as TCP/IP.
#
# To permit both the valerie and stephanie system users to access MySQL through socket file connections that use the account,
# this cna be done in two ways:
#
# ) Name both users at account-creation time, one following CREATE_USER and the otehr in the authentication string:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'valerie'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket AS 'stephanie';
#
# ) If you have already used CREATE_USER To create the account for a single user, use ALTER_USER to add the second user:
#
# 			CREATE USER 'valerie'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket;
# 			ALTER USER 'valerie'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket AS 'stephanie';
#
# To access the account, both valerie and stephanie specify --user=valerie at connect time.
#
# TEST PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION
#
# MySQL includes a test plugin that checks account credentials and logs success or failure to the server error log.
#
# This is a loadable plugin (not built in) and must be installed prior to use.
#
# The test plugin source code is separate from the server source, unlike the built-in native plugin, so it can be examined
# as a relativily simple example demonstrating how to write a loadable authentication plugin.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		This plugin is intended for testing and development purposes, and is not for use in production environments or on servers that
# 		are exposed to public networks.

# For SASL LDAP authentication, the base distinguished name (DN).
# This variable can be used to limit the scope of searches by anchoring them at a certain location

#
# Suppose that members of one set of LDAP user entries each have this form:

#
# And that members of another set of LDAP user entries each have this form:
#
# 		uid=user_name,pwd=user_password,ou=Admin,dc=example,dc=com
#
# Then searches work like this for different base DN values:
#
# 		) If the base DN is ou=People,dc=example,dc=com: Searches find user entries only in the first set.
#
# 		) If the base DN is ou=Admin,dc=example,dc=com: Searches find user entries only in the second set.

#
# 					nameserver 10.172.166.100
#
# 				2. Configure the appropriate zone file for the name server with SRV records for the LDAP servers:
#
# 					_ldap._tcp.mem.local. 86400 IN SRV 0 100 389 ldap1.mem.local.
# 					_ldap._tcp.mem.local. 86400 IN SRV 0 100 389 ldap2.mem.local.
# 					_ldap._tcp.mem.local. 86400 IN SRV 0 100 389 ldap3.mem.local.
#
# 				3. It may also be necessary to specify the IP address for the LDAP servers in /etc/hosts if the server host cannot be resolved.
#
# 					For example, add lines like this to the file:
#
# 						10.172.166.101 ldap1.mem.local
# 						10.172.166.102 ldap2.mem.local
# 						10.172.166.103 ldap3.mem.local
#
# 					With the DNS configured as just described, the server-side LDAP plugin can discover the LDAP servers and will try to
# 					authenticate in all domains until authentication succeeeds or there are no more servers.
#
# 					Windows need no such settings as just described. Given the LDAP server host in the authentication_ldap_simple_server_host value,
# 					the Windows LDAP library searches all domains and attempts to authenticate.

#
# THE CONNECTION CONTROL PLUGINS
#
# MySQL Server includes a plugin library that enables administrators to introduce an increasing delay in server responses
# to clients after a certain number of consecutive failed connection attempts.
#
# This capability provides a deterrent that slows down brute force attacks that attempt to access MysQL user accs.
# the plugin library contains two plugins:
#
# 		) CONNECTION_CONTROL checks incoming connections and adds a delay to server responses as necessary.
#
# 			This plugin also exposes system variables that enables its operation to be configured and a status
# 			variable that provides rudimentary monitoring information.
#
# 			The CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin uses the audit plugin interface.
#
# 			To collect information, it subscribes to the MYSQL_AUDIT_CONNECTION_CLASSMASK event class,
# 			and processes MYSQL_AUDIT_CONNECTION_CONNECT and MYSQL_AUDIT_CONNECTION_CHANGE_USER subevents to
# 			check whether the server should introduce a delay befor responding to client connection attempts.
#
# 		) CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS implements an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table that exposes more detailed monitoring
# 			information for failed connection attempts.
#
# The following section provides information about connection-control plugin installation and configuration.
#
# More info about the CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS later.
#
# CONNECTION-CONTROL PLUGIN INSTALLATION
#
# This section describes how ot install the connection-control plugins, CONNECTION_CONTROL and CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS.
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by the plugin_dir
# system variable).
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# The plugin library file base name is connection_control. The file name suffix differs per platform (for example, .so for Unix and Unix-like systems,
# .dll for Windows)
#
# To load the plugins at server startup, use the --plugin-load-add option to name the library file that contains them.
# With this plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the server starts.
#
# For example, put these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix for your platform as necessary):
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		plugin-load-add=connection_control.so
#
# After modifying my.cnf, restart the server to cause the new settings to take efect.
#
# Alternatively, to register the plugins at runtime, use these statements (adjust the .so suffix as called for):
#
# 		INSTALL PLUGIN CONNECTION_CONTROL
# 			SONAME 'connection_control.so';
# 		INSTALL PLUGIN CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
# 			SONAME 'connection_control.so';
#
# INSTALL_PLUGIN loads the plugin immediately, and also registers it in the mysql.plugins system table to cause the server to load it for each
# subsequent normal startup.
#
# To verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
# 		FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
# 		WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'connection%';
#
#
# +------------------------------------------------------------+
# | PLUGIN_NAME 											| PLUGIN_STATUS|
# +------------------------------------------------------------+
# | CONNECTION_CONTROL 									| ACTIVE 		|
# | CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS  	| ACTIVE 		|
# +------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# If the plugins have been previously registered with INSTALL_PLUGIN or are loaded with --plugin-load-add, you can use the
# --connection-control and --connection-control-failed-login-attempts options at server startup to control plugin activation.
#
# For example, to load the plugins at startup and prevent them from being removed
# at runtime, use these options:
#
# [mysqld]
# plugin-load-add=connection_control.so
# connection-control=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
# connection-control-failed-login-attempts=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
#
# If it is desired to prevent the server from running without a given connection-control plugin, use an option value
# of FORCE or FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT to force server startup to fail if the plugin does not initialize successfully.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		It is possible to install one plugin without the other, but both must be installed for full connection-control capability.
#
# 		In particular, installing only the CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS plugin is of little use because without
# 		the CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin to provide the data that populates the CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS table,
# 		retrievals from the table will always be empty.
#
# CONNECTION DELAY CONFIGURATION
#
# To enable you to configure its operation, the CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin exposes several system variables:
#
# 		) connection_control_failed_connections_threshold: 
# 				
# 			The number of consecutive failed connection attempts permitted to clients before the server
# 			adds a delay for subsequent connection attempts.
#
# 		) connection_control_min_connection_delay: The amount of delay to add for each consecutive connection failure above the TH.
#
# 		) connection_control_max_connection_delay: The maximum delay to add.
#
# To entirely disable checking for failed connection attempts, set connection_control_failed_connections_threshold to zero.
#
# If connection_control_failed_connections_threshold is > 0, the amount of delay is zero up through that many consecutive
# failed connection attempts.
#
# Thereafter, the amount of delay is the number of failed attempts above the TH, multiplied by connection_control_min_connection_delay MS.
#
# For example, with the default connection_control_failed_connections_threshold and connection_control_min_connection_delay values of 3
# and 1000, respectively - there is no delay for the first consecutive failed connection attempts by a client, and a additive of 1000 MS
# per fail there after.
#
# Up until the max delay permitted by connection_control_max_connection_delay.
#
# You can set the CONNECTION_CONTROL system variables at server startup or runtime.
#
# Suppose that you want to permit four consecutive failed conn attempts before the server starts delaying its reponses - and to
# increase the delay to 1500 MS for each additional failure after that.
#
# To set the relevant variables at server startup, put these lines in the server my.cnf file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		plugin-load-add=connection_control.so
# 		connection_control_failed_connections_threshold=4
# 		connection_control_min_connection_delay=1500
#
# To set and persist the variables at runtime, use these statements:
#
# 		SET PERSIST connection_control_failed_connections_threshold = 4;
# 		SET PERSIST connection_control_min_connection_delay = 1500;
#
# SET_PERSIST sets the value for the running MySQL instance.
#
# It also saves the value to be used for subsequent server restarts.
# to change a value for the running MySQL instance without saving it for subsequent restarts, use the GLOBAL keyword rather than PERSIST.
#
# The connection_control_min_connection_delay and connection_control_max_connection_delay System Variables have fixed
# min and max values of 1000 and 2.147.483.647, respectively.
#
# In addition, the permitted range of values of each variable also depends on the current value of hte other:
#
# 		) connection_control_min_connection_delay cannot be set greater than the current value of connection_control_max_connection_delay
#
# 		) connection_control_max_connection_delay cannot be set less than the current value of connection_control_min_connection_delay
#
# Thus - to make the changes required for some configurations, you might need to set the variables in a specific order.
#
# Suppose that the current minimum and maximum delays are 1000 and 2000, and that you want to set them to 3000 and 5000.
#
# You cannot first set connection_control_min_connection_delay to 3000, because that is greater than the current
# connection_control_max_connection_delay value of 2k.
#
# Instead, set connection_control_max_connection_delay to 5000, then connection_control_min_connection_delay to 3000.
#
# CONNECTION FAILURE ASSESSMENT
#
# When the CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin is installed, it checks connection attempts and tracks whether they fail or succeed.
#
# For this purpose, a failed connection attempt is one for which the client user and host match a known MySQL account
# but the provided credentials are incorrect, or do not match any known account.
#
# Failed-connection counting is based on the user/host combination for each connection attempt.
#
# Determination of the applicable user name and host name takes proxying into account and occurs as follows:
#
# 		) If the client user proxies another user, the proxying user's information is used.
#
# 			For example, if external_user@example.com proxies proxy_user@example.com, connection counting
# 			uses the proxying user, external_user@example.com, rather than the proxied user - proxy_user@example.com
#
# 			Both external_user@example.com and proxy_user@example.com must have valid entries in the mysql.user system table
# 			and a proxy relationship betweem them must be defined in the mysql.proxies_priv system table.
#
# 		) If the client user does not proxy another user, but does match a mysql.user entry, counting uses the CURRENT_USER()
# 		value corresponding to that entry.
#
# 		For example, if a user user1 connecting from a host host1.example.com matches a user1.host1.example.com entry, counting
# 		uses user1@host1.example.com
#
# 		If the user matches a user1@%.example.com, user1@%.com or user1@% entry instead, counting uses user1@%.example.com, user1@%.com or user1@%, respectively.
#
# For the cases just described, the connection attempt matches some mysql.user entry and whether the request succeeds or fails depends 
# on whether the client provides the correct authentication credentials.
#
# For example, if the client presents an incorrect password, the connection attempt fails.
#
# If the connection attempt matches no mysql.user entry, the attempt fails. 
#
# In this case, no CURRENT_USER() value is avaialable and connection-failure counting uses the user name
#  provided by the client and the client host as determined by the server.
#
# For example, if a client attempts to connect as user user2 from host host2.example.com, the user name part is available
# in the client request and the server determines the host information.
#
# The user/host combination used for counting is user2@host2.example.com
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The server maintains information about which client hosts can possibly connect to the server (essentially the union of host values for mysql.user entries).
# 		If a client attempts to connect from any other host, the server rejects the attempt at an early stage of connection setup:
#
# 			ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host 'host_name' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
#
# 		Because this type of rejection occurs so early, CONNECTION_CONTROL does not see it, and does not count it.
#
# CONNECTION FAILURE MONITORING
#
# To monitor failed connections, use these information sources:
#
# 		) The Connection_control_delay_generated status variable indicates the number of times the server added a delay to its response
# 			to a failed connection attempt.
#
# 			This does not count attempts that occur before reaching the threshold defined by the connection_control_failed_connections_threshold system variable.
#
# 		) The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS table provides information about the current number of consecutive failed connection
# 			attemtps per client user/host combination.
#
# 			This counts all failed attempts, regardless of whether they were delayed.
#
# Assigning a value to connection_control_failed_connections_threshold at runtime resets all accumulated failed-connection counters to 0,
# which has these visible effects:
#
# 		) The Connection_control_delay_generated status variable is reset to 0.
#
# 		) The CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS table becomes empty.
#
# CONNECTION-CONTROL SYSTEM AND STATUS VARIABLES
#
# This section describes the system and status variables that the CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin provides to enable its
# operation to be configured and monitored.
#
# CONNECTION-CONTROL SYSTEM VARIABLES
#
# If the CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin is installed, it exposes these system variables:
#
# connection_control_failed_connections_threshold
#
# Property 												Value
# Command-line Format 								--connection-control-failed-connections-threshold=#
# Introduced: 											8.0.1
# System variable: 									connection_control_failed_connections_threshold
# Scope: 												Global
# Dynamic: 												Yes
# SET_VAR Hint applies: 							No
# Type: 													Integer
# Default value: 										3
# Min: 													0
# Max: 													2147483647
#
# The number of consecutive failed connection attempts permitted to clients before the server adds a delay for 
# subsequent connection attempts:
#
# 		) If the variable has a nonzero value N, the server adds a delay beginning with consecutive failed attempt N+1.
#
# 			If a client has reached the point where connection responses are delayed, the delay also occurs for 
# 			the next subsequent successful connection.
#
# 		) Setting this variable to 0 disables failed-connection counting. In this case, the server never adds delays.
#
# For information about how connection_control_failed_connections_threshold interacts with other connection-control
# system and status variables, see earlier.
#
# connection_control_max_connection_delay
#
# Property 												Value
# Command-line Format 								--connection-control-max-connection-delay=#
# Introduced: 											8.0.1
# System Variable: 									connection_control_max_connection_delay
# Scope: 												Global
# Dynamic: 												Yes
# SET_VAR Hint applies: 							No
# Type: 													Integer
# Default: 												2.147.483.647
# Min: 													1000
# Max: 												   2.147.483.647
# 													
#
# The maximum delay in milliseconds for server response to failed connection attempts, if connection_control_failed_connections_threshold
# is greater than 0.
#
# For information about how connection_control_max_connection_delay interacts with other connection-control system and status variables,
# see earlier.
#
# connection_control_min_connection_delay
#
# Property 												Value
# Command-Line Format 								--connection-control-min-connection-delay=#
# Introduced: 											8.0.1
# System Variable: 									connection_control_min_connection_delay
# Scope: 												Global
# Dynamic: 												Yes
# SET_VAR Hint Applies: 							No
# Type: 													Integer
# Default value: 										1000
# Min value: 											1000
# Max value: 											2.147.483.647
#
# The minimum delay in MS for sever responses to failed connection attempts, if connection_control_failed_connections_threshold is greater
# than 0.
#
# This is also the amount by which the server increases the delay for additional successive failures once it begins delaying.
#
# For more information about how connection_control_min_connection_delay interacts with other connection-control system and status variables
# , see previous details.
#
# CONNECTION-CONTROL STATUS VARIABLES
#
# If the CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin is installed, it exposes this status variable:
#
# 		) Connection_control_delay_generated
#
# 				The number of times the server added a delay to its response to a failed connection attempt.
# 				This does not count attempts that occur before reaching the threshold defined by the connection_control_failed_connections_threshold system variable.
#
# 				This variable provides a simple counter. For more detailed connection-control monitoring information, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA
# 				CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS table. More on that later.
#
# 				Assigning a value to connection_control_failed_connections_threshold at runtime resets Connection_control_delay_generated to zero.
#
# THE PASSWORD VALIDATION COMPONENT
#
# The validate_password components serves to test passwords and improve security.
# This component exposes system variables that enable you to define password policy, and status variables for component monitoring.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		In MySQL 8.0.4, the validate_password plugin was reimplemented as the validate_password component.
# 		The following instructions describe how to use the component, not the plugin.
#
# 		For instructions on using it, see external resources.
#
# 		The plugin form of validate_password is available but is deprecated and will be removed.
# 		MySQL installations that use it - should transition to using the component instead. More on that later.
#
# The validate_password component implements these capabilities:
#
# 		) In SQL statements that assign a password supplied as a cleartext value, the component checks the password against
# 			the current password policy and rejects the password if it is weak (the statement returns an ER_NOT_VALID_PASSWORD error)
#
# 			This applies to the ALTER_USER, CREATE_USER, GRANT and SET_PASSWORD statements.
#
# 		) The VALIDATE_PASSWORD_STRENGTH() SQL function asssesses the strength of potentional PWs. 
#
# 			The function takes a PW argument and returns an integer from 0 (weak) to 100 (strong)
#
# For example, validate_password checks the cleartext password in the following statement.
#
# Under the default password policy, which requires passwords to be at least 8 characters long -
# the PW is weak and the statement produces an error.
#
# 		ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'abc';
# 		ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy requirements
#
# Passwords specified as hashed values are not checked because the original password values is not available
# for checking:
#
# ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
# IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
# AS '<hash>';
# Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
#
# To configure PW checking, modify the system variable having names of the form validate_password.xxx, these are the
# parameters that control password policy. See later.
#
# If validate_password is not installed, the validate_password.xxx system variables are not available, passwords
# in statements are not checked and the VALIDATE_PASSWORD_STRENGTH() function always returns 0.
#
# For example, without the plugin installed, accounts can be assigned PWs shorter than 8 chars.
#
# Assuming that validate_password is installed, it implements three levels of PW checking:
#
# LOW, MEDIUM and STRONG.
#
# The default is MEDIUM; to change this, modify the value of validate_password.policy
#
# The policies implement increasingly strict password tests. 
# The following descriptions refer to default param values, which can be modified by changing the appropriate system variables.
#
# 	) LOW policy test password length only. Passwords must be at least 8 chars long. To change this length, modify the validate_password.length
#
# 	) MEDIUM policy adds the conditions that passwords must contain at least 1 numeric character, 1 lowercase character, 1 uppercase character,
# 		and 1 special (nonalphanumeric) character.
#
# 		TO change these values, modify validate_password.number_count, validate_password.mixed_case_count and
# 		validate_password.special_char_count.
#
# 	) STRONG policy adds the condition that password substrings of length 4 or longer must not match words in the dictioanry file,
# 		if one has been specified.
#
# 		To specify the dictionary file, modify validate_password.dictionary_file
#
# In addition, validate_password supports the capability of rejecting passwords that match the user name part of the effective
# user account for the current session, either forward or in reverse.
#
# To provide control over this capabiblity, validate_password exposes a validate_password.check_user_name system variable,
# which is enabled by default.
#
# PASSWORD VALIDATION COMPONENT INSTALLATION AND UNINSTALLATION
#
# This section describes how to install and uninstall the validate_password password-validation component.
# For general info, see earlier.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		If you install MySQL 8.0 using the MySQL Yum repository, MySQL SLES Repository or RPM packages provided by Oracle,
# 		the validate_password component is enabled by default after you start your MySQL Server for the first time.
#
# 		Upgrades to MySQL 8.0 from 5.7 using Yum or RPM packages leave the validate_password plugin in place.
# 		To make the transition from the validate_password plugin to the validate_password component, see later.
#
# To be usable by the server, the component library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory
# (the directory named by the plugin_dir system variable)
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# To install validate_password, use this statement:
#
# INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
#
# Component installation is a one-time operation that need not be done per server startup.
#
# INSTALL_COMPONENT loads the component, and also registers it in the mysql.component system table
# to cause it to be loaded during subsequent server startups.
#
# To uninstall validate_password, use this statement:
#
# UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
#
# UNINSTALL_COMPONENT unloads the component, and deregisters it from the mysql.component system table
# to cause it not to be loaded during subsequent server startups.
#
# PASSWORD VALIDATION OPTIONS AND VARIABLES
#
# This section describes the system and status variables that validate_password provides to enable
# its operation to be configured and monitored.
#
# PASSWORD VALIDATION COMPONENT SYSTEM VARIABLES
#
# If the validate_password component is enabled, it exposes several system variables that enable configuration
# of password checking:
#
# SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password.%';
# +----------------------------------------------+
# | Variable_name 						   | Value   |
# +----------------------------------------------+
# | validate_password.check_user_name   | ON 	 |
# | validate_password.dictionary_file 	 | 		 |
# | validate_password.length 			    | 8 	    |
# | validate_password.mixed_case_count  | 1 	    |
# | validate_password.number_count 	    | 1 	    |
# | validate_password.policy 			    | MEDIUM |
# | validate_password.special_char_count| 1 		 |
# +----------------------------------------------+
#
# To change how PWs are checked, you can set these system variables at server startup or at runtime.
# The following list describes the meaning of each variable.
#
# validate_password.check_user_name
#
# 	Property 								Value
# Command-line Format 					--validate-password.check-user-name
# Introduced 								8.0.4
# System Variable 						validate_password.check_user_name
# Scope 										Global
# Dynamic 									Yes
# SET_VAR Hint Applies 					No
# Type 										Boolean
# Default value 							ON
#
# Whether validate_password compares passwords to the user name part of the effective user account
# for the current session and rejects them if they match.
#
# This variable is unavailable unless validate_password is installed.
#
# By default, validate_password.check_user_name is enabled. This variable controls user name matching independent of the value
# of validate_password.policy
#
# When validate_password.check_user_name is enabled, it has these effects:
#
# 		) Checking occurs in all contexts for which validate_password is invoked, which includes use of statements such as ALTER_USER
# 			or SET_PASSWORD to change the current user's password, and invocation of functions such as VALIDATE_PASSWORD_STRENGTH()
#
# 		) The user names used for comparison are taken from the values of the USER() and CURRENT_USER() functions for the current session.
#
# 			An implication is that a user who has sufficient privileges to set another user's password can set the password to that user's name,
# 			and cannot se that user's password to the name of the user executing the statement.
#
# 			For example, 'root'@'localhost' can set the password for 'jeffrey'@'localhost' to 'jeffrey', but cannot set the password
# 			to 'root'
#
# 		) Only the user name part of the USER() and CURRENT_USER() function values is used, not the host name part.
#
# 			If a user name is empty, no comparison occurs.
#
# 		) If a password is the same as the user name or its reverse, a match occurs and the PW is rejected.
#
# 		) User-name matching is case sensitive. The password and user name values are compared as binary strings on a byte-by-byte basis.
#
# 		) If a password matches the user name, VALIDATE_PASSWORD_STRENGTH() returns 0 regardless of how other validate_password system variables are set.
#
# validate_password.dictionary_file
#
# Property 									Values
# Introduced 								8.0.4
# System Variable 						validate_password.dictionary_file
# Scope 										Global
# Dynamic 									Yes
# SET_VAR Hint applies 					No
# Type 										File name
#
# The path name of the dictionary file that validate_password uses for checking passwords.
# This variable is unavailable unless validate_password is installed.
#
# By default, this variable has an empty value and dictionary checks are not performed.
# For dictionary checks to occur, the variable value must be nonempty.
#
# If the file is named as a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the server data directory.
# File contents should be lowercase, one word per line.
#
# Contents are treated as having a character set of utf8.
# The maximum permitted file size if 1mb.
#
# For the dictionary file to be used during password checking, the password policy must be set 
# to 2 (Strong); see the description of the validate_password.policy system variable.
#
# Assuming that is true, each substring of the password of length 4 p to 100 is compared to the
# words in the dictionary file.
#
# Any match causes the password to be rejected. Comparisons are not case sensitive.

#
# PASSWORD VALIDATION PLUGIN OPTIONS
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		In MysQL 8.04, the validate_password plugin was reimplemented as the validate_password component.
# 		The validate_password plugin is deprecated and will be removed.
#
# 		Transition to the component instead. More about this later.
#
# To control the activation of the validate_password plugin, use this option:
#
# --validate-password[=value]
#
# Property 									Value
# Command-line Format 					--validate-password[=value]
# Type 										Enumeration
# Default: 									ON
# Valid: 									ON, OFF, FORCE, FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
#
# This option controls how the server loads the deprecated validate_password plugin at startup.
#
# The value should be one of those available for plugin-loading options.
#
# For example, --validate-password=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT tells the server to load the plugin
# at startup and prevents it from being removed while the server is running.
#
# This option is available only if the validate_password plugin has been previously registered with
# INSTALL_PLUGIN or is loaded with --plugin-load-add.
#
# PASSWORD VALIDATION PLUGIN SYSTEM VARIABLES
#
# Note:
#
# 		In MySQL 8.0.4, the validate_password plugin was reimplemented as the validate_password component.
# 		The validate_password plugin is deprecated.
#
# 		Thus, it's system variables are also deprecated, use the component system variables instead.
#
# validate_password_check_user_name
#
# Property 								Value
# Command-line Format 				--validate-password-check-user-name
# System variable 					validate_password_check_user_name
# Scope 									Global
# Dynamic 								Yes
# SET_VAR Hint Applies 				No
# Type 									Boolean
# Default Value 						ON
#
# This validate_password plugin system variable is deprecated.
# Use corresponding validate_password.check_user_name system variable of the validate_password component instead.
#
# // The system variables of which are for the plugin are deprecated and mirror the updated Componeont system variables.
#
# TRANSITIONING TO THE PASSWORD VALIDATION COMPONENT
#
# Note:
#
# 		In MySQL 8.0.4, the validate_password plugin was reimplemented as the validate_password component.
# 		The validate_password plugin is deprecated.
#
# MySQL installations that currently use the validate_password plugin should make the transition
# to using the validate_password component instead.
#
# To do so, use the following procedure.
#
# The procedure installs the component before uninstalling the plugin, to avoid having a time window during which no PW validation
# occurs.
#
# (The component and plugin can be installed simultaneously. In this case, the server attempts ot use the component,
# falling back to the plugin if the component is unavailable).
#
# 1. Install the validate_password component:
#
# 		INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
#
# 2. Test the validate_password component to ensure that it works as expected.
#
# If you need to set any validate_password.xxx SYSTEM VARIABLES, you can do so at
# runtime using SET GLOBAL (Any option file changes that must be made are performed in the next step)
#
# 3. Adjust any references to the plugin system and status variables to refer to the corresponding component system and
# 		status variables.
#
# 		Suppose that you configure the plugin at startup using an option file like this:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		validate-password=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
# 		validate_password_dictionary_file=/usr/share/dict/words
# 		validate_password_length=10
# 		validate_password_number_count=2
#
# To adjust hte option file, omit the --validate-password option (it applies only to the plugin, not the component),
# and modify the system variable references:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		validate_password.dictionary_file=/usr/share/dict/words
# 		validate_password.length=10
# 		validate_password.number_count=2
#
# Similar adjustments are needed for applications that refer at runtime to validate_password plugin system and status variables.
#
# 4. Uninstall the validate_password plugin:
#
# 		UNINSTALL PLUGIN validate_password;
#
# If the validate_password plugin is loaded at server startup using a --plugin-load or --plugin-load-add option
# omit that option from the server startup procedure.
#
# For example, if the option is listed in a server option file, remove it from the file.
#
# 5. Restart the Server.
#
# THE MYSQL KEYRING
#
# MySQL Server supports a keyring service that enables internal server components and plugins to securly store sensitve information
# for later retrieval. The implementation is plugin-based:
#
# 	) The keyring_file plugin stores keyring data in a file local to the server host. This plugin is available in all MySQL distribs.
# 		Both community and Enterprise included.
#
# 	) The keyring_encrypted_file plugin stores keyring data in an encrypted file local to the server host.
# 		This plugin is available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distribs.
#
# 	) keyring_okv is a KMIP 1.1 plugin for use with KMIP-compatible back end keyring storage products such as Oracle Key Vault and 
# 		Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Applicance.
#
# 		Available in the Enterprise edition distribs.
#
# ) The keyring_aws plugin communicates with the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service for key generation and uses a local file
# 		for key storage.
#
# 		This plugin is available in MySQL Enterprise Distribs.
#
# ) A MySQL server operational mode enables migration of keys between underlying keyring keystores.
# 		This enables DBAs to switch a MySQL installation from one keyring plugin to another.
#
# ) An SQL interface for keyring key management is implemented as a set of user-defined functions (UDFs)
#
# WARNING:
#
# 		The keyring_file and keyring_encrypted_file plugins for encryption key management are not intended as regulatory compliance solution.
# 		Security standards such as PCI, FIPS and others require use of key management systems to secure, manage and protect encryption keys
# 		in key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs)
#
# Uses for the keyring within MySQL include:
#
# ) The innoDB sotrage engine uses the keyring to store its key for tablespace encryption.
# 		InnoDB can use any supported keyring plugin.
#
# ) MYSQL Enterprise Audit uses the keyring to store the audit log file encryption password.
# 		The audit login plugin can use any supported keyring plugin.
#
# Keyring plugins and UDFs access a keyring service that provides the interface for server components to the keyring.
# More of this and other things, later.
#
# KEYRING PLUGIN INSTALLATION
#
# Keyring service consumers require a keyring plugin to be installed. MySQL provides these plugin choices:
#
# 		) keyring_file: A plugin that stores keyring data in a file local to the server host. Available in all MySQL distribs.
#
# 		) keyring_encrypted_file: A plugin that stores keyring data in an encrypted file local to the server host. Available in MySQL EE Distribs.
#
# 		) keyring_okv: A plugin that uses KMIP-compatible back end keyring storage products such as Oracle Key Vault and Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure applicance.
# 							Available in MySQL EE distribs.
#
# 		) keyring_aws: A plugin that communicates with the Amazon Web Services Key Management Services as a back end for key generation and uses a local file
# 							for key storage. available in MySQL EE distribs.
#
# This section describes how to install the keyring plugin of your choosing. 
#
# If you intend to use keyring user-defined functions (UDFs) in conjunction with the keyring plugin, install the UDFs following
# keyring installation using the instructions described later.
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory (the dir named by the plugin_dir
# system variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# Installation for each keyring plugin is similar. The following instructions use keyring_file. Users of a different keyring plugin
# can substitute its name for keyring_file.
#
# The keyring_file plugin library file base name is keyring_file.
#
# The file name suffix differs per platform (for example .so for Unix based systems, .dll for Windows)
#
# NOTE:
# 		Only one keyring plugin should be enabled at a time. Enabling multiple keyring plugins is unsupported and results may not be as anticipated.
#
# The keyring plugin must be loaded early during the server startup sequence so that server components can access it as necessary
# during their own initialization.
#
# For example, the InnoDB storage engine uses the keyring for tablespace encryption, so the keyring plugin must be loaded
# and available prior to InnoDB initialization.
#
# To load the plugin, use the --early-plugin-load option to name the plugin library file that contains it.
#
# For example, on platforms where the plugin library file suffix is .so, use these lines in the server my.cnf
# file (adjust the .so suffix for your platform as necessar):
#
# [mysqld]
# early-plugin-load=keyring_file.so
#
# Before starting the server, check the notes for your chosen keyring plugin to see whether it permits or requires additional configuration.
#
# After performing any plugin-specific configuration, verify plugin installation.
#
# With the MySQL server running, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the
# SHOW_PLUGINS statement.
#
# For example:
#
# SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'keyring%';
# +--------------------------------++
# | PLUGIN_NAME 		| PLUGIN_STATUS|
# +------------------+--------------+
# | keyring_file 		| ACTIVE 		|
# +------------------+--------------+
#
# If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# If no keyring plugin is available when a server component tries to access the keyring service,
# the service cannot be used by that component.
#
# As a result, the component may fail to initialize or may initialize with limited functionality.
#
# For example, if InnoDB finds that there are encrypted tablespaces when it initializes, it attempts
# to access the keyring.
#
# If the keyring is unavailable, InnoDB can access only unencrypted tablespaces.
#
# To ensure that InnoDB can access encrypted tablespaces as well, use --early-plugin-load to
# load the keyring plugin. 
#
# Plugins can be loaded by other methods, such as the --plugin-load or --plugin-load-add option or the
# INSTALL_PLUGIN statement.
#
# However, keyring plugins loaded using those methods may be available too late in the server
# startup sequence for certain server components, such as InnoDB:
#
# 		) Plugin loading using --plugin-load or --plugin-load-add occurs after InnoDB initialization
#
# 		) PLugins installed using INSTALL_PLUGIN are registered in the mysql.plugin system table and
# 			loaded automatically for subsequent server restarts.
#
# 			However, because mysql.plugin is an InnoDB table, any plugins named in it can be loaded
# 			during startup only after InnoDB initialization.
#
# USING THE KEYRING_FILE FILE-BASED PLUGIN
#
# The keyring_file is a keyring plugin that stores keyring data in a file local to the server host.
#
# Warning:
#
# 		The keyring_file plugin for encryption key management is not intended as a regulatory compliance solution.
# 		Security standards such as PCI, FIPS, and others require use of key management systems to secure,
# 		manage and protect encryption keys in key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs)
#
# To install the keyring_file plugin, use the general keyring installation found earlier, together
# with the configuration information specific to keyring_file found here.
#
# TO be usable during the server startup process, keyring_file must be loaded using the --early-plugin-load
# option.
#
# The keyring_file_data system variable optionally configures the location of the file used by the keyring_file
# plugin for data storage.
#
# The default value is platform specific. To configure the file location explicitly, set the variable value at
# startup.
#
# For example, use these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix and file location for your platform as necessary):
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		early-plugin-load=keyring_file.so
# 		keyring_file_data=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring
#
# Keyring operations are transactional: The keyring_file plugin uses a backup file during write operations
# to ensure that it can roll back to the original file if an operation fails.
#
# The backup file has the same name as the value of the keyring_file_data system variable with a suffix of .backup
#
# For additional info about keyring_file_data, see later.
#
# To ensure that keys are flushed only when the correct keyring storage file exists, keyring_file stores a 
# SHA-256 checksum of the keyring in the file.
#
# Before updating the file, the plugin verifies that it contains the expected checksum.
#
# The keyring_file plugin supports the functions that comprise the standard keyring service interface.
#
# Keyring operations performed by those functions are accessible at two levels:
#
# 		) SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the user-defined functions (UDFs)
#
# 		) C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service functions described later.
#
# Example (using UDFs):
#
# 		SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
# 		SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
#
# THe key types permitted by keyring_file are described later.
#
# USING THE KEYRING_ENCRYPTED FILE KEYRING PLUGIN
#
# Note:
#
# 		The keyring_encrypted_file plugin is an extension included in MySQL EE.
#
# The keyring_encrypted_file plugin is a keyring plugin that stores keyring data in a encrypted
# file local to the server host.
#
# Warning:
#
# 		The keyring_encrypted_file plugin for encryption key management is not intended as a regulatory compliance solution.
# 		Security standards such as PCI, FIPS and others require use of key management systems to secure, manage and protect
# 		keys in key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs)
#
# To install the keyring_encrypted_file plugin, use the general keyring installation instructions found earlier, together
# with the configuration information specific to keyring_encrypted_file found here.
#
# TO be usable during the server startup process, keyring_encrypted_file must be loaded using the --early-plugin-load
# option.
#
# TO specify the password for encrypting the keyring data file, set the keyring_encrypted_file_password system variable.
# (The password is mandatory; if not specified at server startup, keyring_encrypted_file initialization fails).
#
# THe keyring_encrypted_file_data system variable optionally configures the location of the file used by the 
# keyring_encrypted_file plugin for data storage.
#
# The default value is platform specific.
#
# To configure the file location explicitly, set the variable value at startup.
# For example, use these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix and file location for your platform as necesary and subsittue your chosen PW):
#
# 	[mysqld]
# 	early-plugin-load=keyring_encrypted_file.so
# 	keyring_encrypted_file_data=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring-encrypted
# 	keyring_encrypted_file_password=password
#
# Because the my.cnf file stores a PW when written as shown, it should have a restrictive mode and and be accesible 
# only to the account used to run the MySQL server.
#
# Keyring operations are transactional: The keyring_encrypted_file plugin uses a backup file during write operations to ensure
## that it can roll back to the original file if an operation fails.
#
# The backup file has the same name as the value of the keyring_encrypted_file_data system variable with a suffix of .backup
#
# For additional information about the system variables used to configure the keyring_encrypted_file plugin, see later.
#
# To ensure that keys are flushed only when the correct keyring storage file exists, keyring_encrypted file stores a
# SHA-256 checksum of the keyring in the file.
#
# Before updating the file, the plugin verifies that it contains the expected checksum.
#
# In addition, keyring_encrypted_file encrypts file contents using AES before writing the file,
# and decrypts the file contents after reading the file.
#
# The keyring_encrypted_file plugin supports the functions that comprise the standard keyring service interface.
#
# Keyring operations performed by those functions are accessible at two levels:
#
# ) SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the user-defined functions (UDFs)
#
# ) C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service functions
#
# Example (using UDFs):
#
# 		SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
# 		SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
#
# THe key types permitted by keyring_encrypted_file are described later.
#
# USING THE KEYRING_OKV KMIP PLUGIN
#
# Note:
#
# 		The keyring_okv plugin is an extension included in MySQL EE.
#
# The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) enables communication of cryptographic keys between
# a key management service and its clients.
#
# The keyring_okv keyring plugin uses the KMIP 1.1 protocol to communicate securely as a client of a KMIP backend.
#
# Keyring material is generated exclusively by the backend, not by keyring_okv.
#
# THe plugin works with these KMIP-compatible products:
#
# 		) Oracle Key Vault
#
# 		) Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Appliance
#
# The keyring_okv plugin supports the functions that comprise the standard keyring service interface.
# Keyring operations performed by those functions are accessible at two levels:
#
# ) SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the user-defined functions (UDFs)
#
# ) C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service function, described later
#
# Example (using UDFs):
#
# 		SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
# 		SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
#
# The key types permitted by keyring_okv are described later.
#
# TO install the keyring_okv plugin, use the general keyring installation instructions described earlier,
# together with the configuration information specific to keyring_okv found here:
#
# GENERAL KEYRING_OKV CONFIGURATION
#
# Regardless of which KMIP backend the keyring_okv plugin uses for keyring storage,
# the keyring_okv_conf_dir system variable configures the location of the directory used 
# by keyring_okv for its support files.
#
# The default value is empty, so you must set the variable to name a properly configured directory
# before the plugin can communicate with the KMIP backend.
#
# Unless you do so, keyring_okv writes a message to the error log during server startup that it cannot
# communicate:
#
# [Warning] Plugin keyring_okv reported: 'For keyring_okv to be initialized, please point the keyring_okv_conf_dir
# variable to a directory containing Oracle Key Vault configuration file and ssl materials'
#
# The keyring_okv_conf_dir variable must name a directory that contains the following items:
#
# ) okvclient.ora - A file that contains details of the KMIP backend with which keyring_okv will communicate.
#
# ) ssl - A directory that contains the certificate and key files required to establish a secure connection with the KMIP backend:
# 			CA.pem, cert.pem and key.pem.
#
# 			If the key file is password-protected, the ssl directory can contain a single-line text file named password.txt
# 			containing the password needed to decrypt the key file
#
# Both the okvclient.ora file and ssl directory with the certificate and key files are required for keyring_okv to work
# properly.
#
# The procedure used to populate the configuration directory with these files depends on the KMIP backend used with
# keyring_okv, as described elsewhere.
#
# The configuration directory used by keyring_okv as the location for its support files should have a restrictive
# mode and be accessible only to the account used to run the MySQL server.
#
# For example, on Unix and Unix based systems, to use the /usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring-okv directory, the following
# commands (executed as root) create the directory and set its mode and ownership:
#
# 		cd /usr/local/mysql
# 		mkdir mysql-keyring-okv
# 		chmod 750 mysql-keyring-okv
# 		chown mysql mysql-keyring-okv
# 		chgrp mysql mysql-keyring-okv
#
# To be usable during the server startup process, keyring_okv must be loaded using the --early-plugin-load option.
# Also, set the keyring_okv_conf_dir system variable to tell the keyring_okv where to find its configurations dir.
#
# For example, use these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so suffix need be):
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		early-plugin-load=keyring_okv.so
# 		keyring_okv_conf_dir=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring-okv
#
# For additional info regarding keyring_okv_conf_dir - see later.
#
# CONFIGURING KEYRING_OKV FOR ORACLE KEY VAULT
#
# The discussion here assumes that you are familiar with Oracle Key Vault.
# Some pertinent info can be found externally.
#
# In Oracle Key Vault terminology, clients that use Oracle Key to store and retrieve security objects 
# are called endpoints.
#
# To communicate with Oracle Key Vault, it is necessary to register as an endpoint and enroll by downloading
# and installing endpoint support files.
#
# The following procedure briefly summarizes the process of setting up keyring_okv for use with Oracle Key Vault:
#
# 		1. Create the configuration directory for the keyring_okv plugin to use.
#
# 		2. Register an endpoint with Oracle Key Vault to obtain an enrollment token.
#
# 		3. Use the enrollment token to obtain the okvclient.jar client software download
#
# 		4. Install the client software to populate the keyring_okv configuration directory that contains the
# 			Oracle Key Vault support files.
#
# Use the following procedure to configure keyring_okv and Oracle Key Vault to work together.
# This description only summarizes how to interact with Oracle Key Vault.
#
# For details, visit the Oracle Key Vault site nad consult the Oracle Key Vault Administrator's Guide
#
# 1. Create the configuration directory that will contain the Oracle Key Vault support files, and make sure
# 		that the keyring_okv_conf_dir system variable is set to name that directory.
#
# 2. Log in to the Oracle Key Vault management console as a user who has the System Admin role.
#
# 3. Select the endpoints tab to arrive at the Endpoints page. On the endpoints page, click add..
#
# 4. Provide the required endpoint information to register.
# 		The endpoint type should be other.
#
# 		Successfully registering results in an enrollment token.
#
# 5. Log out from the Oracle Key Vault server.
#
# 6. Connect again to the Oracle Key Vault server, this time without logging in.
# 		Use the endpoint enrollment token to enroll and request the okvclient.jar software
# 		download.
#
# 		Save this file to your system.
#
# 7. install the okvclient.jar file using the following command (required JDK >= 1.4):
#
# 		java -jar okvclient.jar -d dir_name [-v]
#
# 		The directory name following the -d option is the location in which to install the extracted files.
#
# 		The -v option, if given, causes log information to be produced that may be useful if the command
# 		fails. 
#
# 		When the command asks for an Oracle Key Vault endpoint password, do not provide one.
# 		Instead, just press enter.
#
# 		(The result is that no PW will bw required when the endpoint connects to Oracle Key Vault)
#
# 8. The preceding command produces an okvclient.ora file, which should be in this location under the
# 		directory named by the -d option in the preceding java -jar command:
#
# 		install_dir/conf/okvclient.ora
#
# 		The file contents include lines that look something like this:
#
# 		SERVER=host_ip:port_num
# 		STANDBY_SERVER=host_ip:port_num
#
# 		The keyring_okv plugin attempts to communicate with the server running on the host named
# 		by the SERVER variable and falls back to STANDBY_SERVER if that fails:
#
# 			) For the SERVER variable, a setting in the okvclient.ora file is mandatory
#
# 			) For the STANDBY_SERVER variable, a setting in the okvclient.ora file is optional
#
# 9. Go to the Oracle Key Vault installer directory and test the setup by running this command:
#
# 		okvutil/bin/okvutil list
#
# 		The output should look something like this:

#
# 		For a fresh Oracle Key Vault server (a server without any key in it), the output looks like this instead,
# 		to indicate that there are no keys in the vault:
#
# 			no objects found
#
# 10. Use this command to extract the ssl directory containing SSL materials from the okvclient.jar file:
#
# 		jar xf okvclient jar ssl
#
# 11. Copy the Oracle Key Vault support files (the okvclient.ora file and the ssl directory) into the configuration directory.
#
# 12. (Optional) If you wish to password-protect the key file, use the instructions given later.
#
# After completing the procedure, restart the MySQL server. It loads the keyring_okv plugin and keyring_okv uses the file
# in its configuration directory to communicate with Oracle Key Vault.
#
# Configuring keyring_okv for Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Appliance
#
# Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Appliance uses the KMIP protocol (version 1.1 or 1.2).
# The keyring_okv keyring plugin (which supports KMIP 1.1) can use KeySecure as its KMIP backend for keyring storage.
#
# Use the following procedure to configure keyring_okv and KeySecure to work together.
# THe description only summarizes how to interact with KeySecure.
#
# For details, consult the section named Add a KMIP server in the KeySecure User Guide.
#
# 1. Create the configuration directory that will contain the KeySecure support files, and make sure
# 		that the keyring_okv_conf_dir system variable is set to name that directory.
#
# 		(For details, see the General keyring_okv Configuration)
#
# 2. In the configuration directory, create a subdirectory named ssl to use for storing the required
# 		SSL certificate and key files.
#
# 3. In the configuration directory, create a file named okvclient.ora. It should have the following format:
#
# 		SERVER=host_ip:port_num
# 		STANDBY_SERVER=host_ip:port_num
#
# 		For example, if KeySecure is running on host 198.51.100.20 and listening on port 9002, the okvclient.ora file looks like this:
#
# 		SERVER=198.51.100.20:9002
# 		STANDBY_SERVER=198.51.100.20:9002
#
# 4. Connect to the KeySecure Management Console as an administrator with credentials for Certificate Authorities access.
#
# 5. Navigate to Security >> Local CAs and create a local certificate authority (CA)
#
# 6. Go to Trusted CA lists. Select Default and click on Properties.
#
# 		Then select Edit for Trusted Certificate Authority List and add the CA just created.
#
# 7. Download the CA and save it in the SSL directory as a file named CA.pem
#
# 8. Navigate to Security >> Certificate Requests and create a certificate.
# 		Then you will be able to download a compressed tar file containing certificate PEM files.
#
# 9. Extract the PEM files from in the downloaded file.
# 		For example, if the file name is csr_w_pk_pkcs8.gz, decompress and unpack it using this command:
#
# 		tar zxvf csr_w_pk_pkcs8.gz
#
# 		Two files result from the extraction operation: certificate_request.pem and private_key_pkcs8.pem
#
# 10. Use this openssl command to decrypt the private key and create a file named key.pem:
#
# 		openssl pkcs8 -in private_key_pkcs8.pem -out key.pem
#
# 11. Copy the key.pem file into the ssl directory
#
# 12. Copy the certificate request in certificate_request.pem into the clipboard.
#
# 13. Navigate to Security >> Local CAs.
#
# 		Select the same CA that you created earlier (the one you downloaded to create the CA.pem file),
# 		and click Sign Request.
#
# 		Paste the Certificate Request from the clipboard, choose a certificate purpose of Client (the keyring is a client
# 		of KeySecure), and click Sign Reqeuest.
#
# 		The result is a certificate signed with the selected CA in a new page.
#
# 14. Copy the signed certificate to the clipboard, then save the clipboard contents as a file named cert.pem in the ssl directory.
#
# 15. (Optional) If you wish to password-protect the key file, use the instructions in Password-Protecting the keyring_okv Key File.
#
# After completing the preceding procedure, restart the MySQL server.
#
# It loads the keyring_okv plugin and keyring_okv uses the files in its configuration directory to
# communicate with KeySecure.
#
# Password-Protecting the keyring_okv Key File
#
# You can optionally protect the key file with a password and supply a file containing the password to enable the key
# file to be decrypted.
#
# To do so, change location to the ssl directory and perform these steps:
#
# 		1. Encrypt the key.pem key file. For example, use a command like this, and enter the encryption password at the prompts:
#
# 			openssl rsa -des3 -in key.pem -out key.pem.new
# 			Enter PEM pass phrase:
# 			Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
#
# 		2. Save the encryption password in a single-line text file named password.txt in the ssl directory.
#
# 		3. Verify that the encrypted key file can be decrypted using the following command.
#
# 			The decrypted file should display on the console:
#
# 			openssl rsa -in key.pem.new -passin file.password.txt
#
# 		4. Remove the original key.pem file and rename key.pem.new to key.pem
#
# 		5. Change the ownership and access mode of new key.pem file and password.txt file as
# 			necessary to ensure that they have the same restrictions as other files in the SSL Dir.
#
# USING THE KEYRING_AWS AMAZON WEB SERVICES KEYRING PLUGIN
#
# Note:
# 		The keyring_aws plugin is an extension included in MySQL EE.
#
# The keyring_aws plugin is a keyring plugin that communicates with the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service 
# (AWS KMS) as a backend for key generation and uses a local file for key storage.
#
# All keyring material is generated exclusively by the AWS server, not by keyring_aws.
#
# keyring_aws is available on these platforms:
#
# 		) Debian 8
#
# 		) EL7
#
# 		) macOS 10.12
#
# 		) OS X 10.10 and 10.11
#
# 		) SLES 12
#
# 		) Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04
#
# 		) Windows
#
# The discussion here assumes that you are familiar with AWS in general and KMS in particular.
# SOme pertinent info sources:
#
# 	<AWS site>
#
# 	<KMS docs>
#
# The following section provide configuration and usage information for the keyring_aws keyring plugin.
#
# KEYRING_AWS CONFIGURATION
#
# To install the keyring_aws plugin, use the general installation instructions found in the installation part,
# together with the plugin-specific configuration information found here.
#
# THe plugin library contains the keyring_aws plugin and two user-defined functions (UDFs),
# keyring_aws_rotate_cmk() and keyring_aws_rotate_keys().
#
# To configure keyring_aws, you must obtain a secret access key that provides credentials for
# communicating with AWS KMS and write it to a configuration file:
#
# 1. Create an AWS KMS account
#
# 2. Use AWS KMS to create a secret access key ID and secret access key.
# 		The access key serves to verify your identity and that of your applications.
#
# 3. Use the AWS KMS account to create a customer master key (CMK) ID.
# 		At MySQL startup,, set the keyring_aws_cmk_id system variable to the CMK ID value.
#
# 		This variable is mandatory and there is no default. (Its value can be changed at runtime if desired using SET_GLOBAL)
#
# 4. If necessary, create the directory in which the configuration file will be located.
#
# 		The directory should have a restrictive mode and be accessible only to the account
# 		used to run the MySQL server.
#
# 		For example, on UNIX based systems, to use /usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_conf as the
# 		file name, the following commands (executed as root) create its parent directory and set the directory
# 		mode and ownership:
#
# 			cd /usr/local/mysql
# 			mkdir mysql-keyring
# 			chmod 750 mysql-keyring
# 			chown mysql mysql-keyring
# 			chgrp mysql mysql-keyring
#
# 		At MySQL startup, set the keyring_aws_conf_file system variable to /usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_conf to indicate
# 		the configuration file location to the server.
#
# 5. Prepare the keyring_aws configuration file, which should contain two lines:
#
# 		) Line 1: The secret access key ID
#
# 		) Line 2: The secret access key
#
# 		For example, if the key ID is 10xEXAMPLE and the key is 10y/10z/10x, the config file looks like this:
#
# 			10xEXAMPLE
# 			10y/10z/10x
#
# To be usable during the server startup process, keyring_aws must be loaded using the --early-plugin-load option.
#
# The keyring_aws_cmk_id system variable is mandatory and configures the customer master key (CMK) Id obtained from
# the AWS KMS server.
#
# The keyring_aws_conf_file and keyring_aws_data_file system variables optionally configure the locations of the
# files used by the keyring_aws plugin for configuration information and data storage.
#
# The file location variable default values are platform specific.
#
# To configure the locations explicitly, set the variable values at startup.
#
# For example, use these lines in the server my.cnf file (adjust the .so if needed):
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 	 	early-plugin-load=keyring_aws.so
# 		keyring_aws_cmk_id='arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111111111222222223333333:key/abcd1234etc.'
# 		keyring_aws_conf_file=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_conf
# 		keyring_aws_data_file=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_data
#
# For the keyring_aws plugin to start successfully, the configuration file must exist and contain
# valid secret access key information, intiailized as described previously.
#
# The storage file need not exist. If it does not, keyring_aws attempts to create it
# (as well as its parent directory, if necessary)
#
# For additional information about the system variables used to configure the keyring_aws plugin,
# see later.
#
# Start the MySQL server and install the UDFs associated with the keyring_aws plugin.
#
# This is a one-time operation, performed by executing the following statements
# (Adjust the .so need be):
#
# 		CREATE FUNCTION keyring_aws_rotate_cmk RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'keyring_aws.so';
# 		CREATE FUNCTION keyring_aws_rotate_keys RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'keyring_aws.so';
#
# KEYRING_AWS OPERATION
#
# At plugin startup, the keyring_aws plugin reads the AWS secret access key ID and key from its configuration file.
# It also reads any encrypted keys contained in its storage file into its in-memory cache.
#
# During operation, keyring_aws maintains encrypted keys in the in-memory cache and uses the storage file as
# local persistent storage.
#
# Each keyring operation is transactional: keyring_aws either successfully changes both the in-memory key cache
# and the keyring storage file; or the operation fails and the keyring state remains unchanged.
#
# To ensure that keys are flushed only when the correct keyring storage file exists, keyring_aws stores a
# SHA-256 checksum of the keyring in the file.
#
# Before updating the file, the plugin verifies that it contains the expected checksum.
#
# The keyring_aws plugin supports the functions that comprise the standard keyring service interface.
# Keyring operations performed by these functions are accessible at two levels:
#
# ) C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring-service functions described later
#
# ) SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the user-defined functions (UDFs) described later
#
# Example (using UDFs):
#
# 		SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
# 		SELECT Keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
#
# In addition, the keyring_aws_rotate_cmk() and keyring_aws_rotate_keys() UDFs "extend" the keyring plugin
# interface to provide AWS-related capabilities not covered by the standard keyring service interface.
#
# These capabilities are accessible only by calling the UDFs.
#
# There are no corresponding C-language key service functions.
#
# The key types permitted by keyring_aws are described later.
#
# KEYRING_AWS CREDENTIAL CHANGES
#
# Assuming that the keyring_aws plugin has initialized properly at server startup, it is possible to change the credentials
# used for communicating with AWS KMS:
#
# 	1. Use AWS KMS to create a new secret access key ID and secret access key.
#
# 	2. Store the new credentials in the configuration file (the file named by the keyring_aws_conf_file system variable).
#
# 		The file format is as described previously.
#
# 	3. Reinitialize the keyring_aws plugin so that it rereads the configuration file.
# 
# 		Assuming that the new credentials are valid, the plugin should initialize successfully.
#
# 		There are two ways to reinitialize the plugin:
#
# 			) Restart the server. This is simpler and has no side effects, but is not suitable for installations that require
# 				minimal server downtime with as few restarts as possible.
#
# 			) Reinitialize the plugin without restarting the server by executing the following statements (adjust the .so suffix as called for):
#
# 				UNINSTALL PLUGIN keyring_aws;
# 				INSTALL PLUGIN keyring_aws SONAME 'keyring_aws.so';
#
# 		Note:
#
# 			In addition to loading a plugin at runtime, INSTALL_PLUGIN has the side effect of registering the plugin in the mysql.plugin system table.
#
# 			Because of this, if you decide to stop using keyring_aws, it is not sufficient to remove the --early-plugin-load
# 			option from the set of options used to start the server.
#
# 			That stops the plugin from loading early, but the server still attempts to load it when
# 			it gets to the point in the startup sequence where it loads the plugins registered in mysql.plugin
#
# 			Consequently, if you execute the UNINSTALL_PLUGIN plus INSTALL_PLUGIN sequence just described to change
# 			the AWS KMS credentials, then to stop using keyring_aws, it is necessary to execute UNINSTALL_PLUGIN again to
# 			unregister the plugin in addition to removing the --early-plugin-load option.
#
# MIGRATING KEYS BETWEEN KEYRING KEYSTORES
#
# The MySQL server supports an operational mode that enables migration of keys between underlying
# keyring keystores.
#
# This enables DBAs to switch a MySQL installation from one keyring plugin to another.
#
# A migration server (that is, a server started in key migration mode) does not accept client connections.
# 
# Instead, it runs only long enough to migrate keys, then exits.
#
# A migration server reports errors to the console (the standard error output)
#
# It is possible to perform offline or online key migration:
#
# 		) If you are sure that no running server on the local host is using the source or destination keystore,
# 			an offline migration is possible.
#
# 			In this case, the migration server can modify the keystores without possibility of a running server
# 			modifying keystore content during the migration.
#
# 		) If a running server on the local host is using the source or destination keystore, an online migration
# 			must be performed.
#
# 			In this case, the migration server connects to the running server and instructs it to pause keyring operations
# 			while key migration is in progress.
#
# The result of a key migration operation is that the destination keystore contains the keys it had prior to the migration,
# plus the keys from the source keystore.
#
# THe source keystore is the same before and after the migration because keys are copied, not moved.
#
# If a key to be copied already exists in the destination keystore, an error occurs and the destination keystore
# is restored to its premigration state.
#
# The user who invokes the server in key-migration mode must not be the root system user, and must have
# permission to read and write the keyring files.
#
# To perform a key migration operation, determine which key migration options are needed.
#
# Migration options indicate which keyring plugins are involved,, and whether to perform an
# offline or online migration.
#
# ) TO indicate the source and destination keyring plugins, specify these options:
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-source: The source keyring plugin that manages the keys to be migrated.
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-destination: The destination keyring plugin to which the migrated keys are to be copied.
#
# 		These options tell the server to run in key migration mode. Both options are mandatory for all key migration
# 		operations.
#
# 		The source and destination plugins must differ, and the migration server must support both plugins.
#
# ) For an offline migration, no additional key migration options are needed.
#
# 	WARNING:
#
# 		Do not perform an offline migration involving a keystore that is in used by a running server.
#
# ) For an online migration, some running server currently is using the source or destination keystore.
#
# 		Specify the key migration options that indicate how to connect to the running server.
#
# 		This is necessary so that hte migration server can connect to the running server and tell it to
# 		pause keyring use during the migration operation.
#
# 		uSe of any of the following options signifies an online migration:
#
# 			) --keyring-migration-host: The host where the running server is located. This is always the local host.
#
# 			) --keyring-migration-user, --keyring-migration-password: The user name and PW for the account to use to connect to the running server.
#
# 			) --keyring-migration-port: For TCP/IP Connections, the port number to connect on the running server.
#
# 			) --keyring-migration-socket: For UNIX socket file or Windows named pipe connections, the socket file or named pipe to connect to
# 													on the running server.
#
# For additional details about the key migration options, see later.
#
# Start the migration server with the key migration options determined as just described, possibly with other options.
#
# Keep the following considerations in mind:
#
# 		) Other server options might be required, such as other configuration parameters for the two keyring plugins.
#
# 		For example, if keyring_file is one of the plugins, you must set the keyring_file_data system variable if the keyring
# 		data file location is not the default location.
#
# 		Other non-keyring options may be required as well.
#
# 		One way to specify these options is by using --defaults-file to name an option file that contains the required options.
#
# 		) If you invoke the migration server from a system account different from that normally used to run MySQL, it might create
# 			keyring directories or files that are inaccessible to the server during normal operations.
#
# 			Suppose that mysqld normally runs as the mysql system user, but you invoke the migration server while logged in
# 			as isabel.
#
# 			Any new directories or files created by the migration server will be owned by isabel.
#
# 			Subsequent startup will fail when a server run as the mysql system user attempts to access file system
# 			objects owned by isabel.
#
# 			To avoid this problem, start the migration server as the root system user and provide a --user=user_name option,
# 			where user_name is the system account normally used to run MySQL.
#
# 		) The migration server expects path name options values to be full paths.
#
# 			Relative path names may not be resolved as you expect.
#
# Example command line for offline key migration:
#
# 		mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf
# 			--keyring-migration-source=keyring_file.so
# 			--keyring-migration-destination=keyring_encrypted_file.so
# 			--keyring_encrypted_file_password=password
#
# Example command line for online key migration:
#
# 		mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf
# 			--keyring-migration-source=keyring_file.so
# 			--keyring-migration-destination=keyring_encrypted_file.so
# 			--keyring_encrypted_file-password=password
# 			--keyring-migration-host=localhost
# 			--keyring-migration-user=root
# 			--keyring-migration-password=root_password
#
# The key migration server performs the migration operation as follows:
#
# 	1. (Online migration only) Connect to the running server using the connection options.
#
# 		The account used to connect must have the privileges required to modify the
# 		global keyring_operations system variable (ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN in addition to either SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN or SUPER)
#
# 	2. (Online migration only) Disable keyring_operations on the running server. ( The running server must support keyring_operations)
#
# 	3. Load the source and destination keyring plugins.
#
# 	4. Copy keys from the source keyring to the destination keyring.
#
# 	5. Unload the keyring plugins.
#
#  6. (Online migration only) Enable keyring_operations on the running server.
#
#  7. (Online migration only) Disconnect from the running server
#
# 	8. Exit
#
# If an error occurs during key migration, any keys that were copied to the destination plugin are removed,
# leaving the destination keystore unchanged.
#
# Important:
#
# 		For an online migration operation, the migration server takes care of enabling and disabling keyring_operations on the running server.
#
# 		However, if the migration server exits abnormally (for example, if someone forcibly terminates it), it is possible
# 		that keyring_operations will not have been re-enabled on the running server, leaving it unable to perform keyring operations.
#
# 		In this case, it may be necessary to connect to the running server and enable keyring_operations manually.
#
# After a successful online key migration operation, the running server might need to be restarted:
#
# 		) If the running server was using the source keystore, it need not be restarted after the migration.
#
# 		) If the running server was using the source keystore before the migration but should use the destination keystore after the migration,
# 			it must be reconfigured to use the destination keyring plugin and restarted.
#
# 		) If the running server was using the destination keystore and will continue to use it, it should be restarted after the migration
# 			to load all keys migrated into the destination keystore.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		MySQL server key migration mode supports pausing a single running server.
#
# 		To perform a key migration if multiple key servers are using the keystores involved,
# 		use this procedure:
#
# 			1. Connect each running server manually and set keyring_operations=OFF
#
# 			2. Use the migration server to perform an offline key migration.
#
# 			3. Connect to each running server manually and set keyring_operations=ON
#
# ALl running servers must support the keyring_operations=ON system variable.
#
# SUPPORTED KEYRING KEY TYPES
#
# MySQL keyring supports generating keys of different types (encryption algorithms) and lengths.
#
# The available key types depend on which keyring plugin is installed.
# A given plugin may also impose constraints on key lengths per key type.
#
# The following table summarizes the permitted key types per keyring plugin.
# Lengths are in bytes.
#
# For a key generated using one of the keyring user-defined functions (UDFs) described later,
# the length can be no longer than 2,048 bytes, due to limitations of the UDF interface.
#
# KEYRING PLUGIN KEY TYPES
#
# Plugin Name 						Permitted Key Type 						Permitted Key lengths for Key Type
#
# keyring_encrypted_file 		AES DSA RSA 								No special restrictions
#
# keyring_file 					AES DSA RSA 								NO special restrictions
#
# keyring_okv 						AES 											16, 24, 32
#
# keyring_aws 						AES 											16, 24, 32
#
# GENERAL PURPOSE KEYRING KEY MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
#
# MySQL Server supports a keyring service that enables internal server components and plugins to securly store sensetive information for later retrieval.
#
# MySQL Server also includes an SQL interface for keyring key management, implemented as a set of general-purpose user-defined functions
# (UDFs) that access the functions provided by the internal keyring service.
#
# The keyring UDFs are contained in a plugin library file, which also contains a keyring_udf plugin that must be
# enabled prior to UDF invocation.
#
# For these UDFs to be used, a keyring plugin such as keyring_file or keyring_okv must be enabled.
#
# The UDFs described here are general purpose and intended for use with any keyring plugin.
#
# A given keyring plugin might have UDFs of its own that are intended for use only with that plugin.
#
# THe following section provides installation instructions for the keyring UDFs and demonstrates how to use them.
# For information about the keyring service functions invoked by teh UDFs, see later.
#
# INSTALLING OR UNINSTALLING GENERAL-PURPOSE KEYRING FUNCTIONS
#
# This section describes how to install or uninstall the keyring user-defined functions (UDFs), which are implemented
# in a plugin library file that also contains a keyring_udf plugin.
#
# For general information about installing or uninstalling plugins and UDFs, see later.
#
# The keyring UDFs enable keyring management operations, but the keyring_udf plugin must also be installed
# because the UDFs will not work correctly without it.
#
# Attempts to use the UDFs without hte keyring_udf plugin result in an error.
#
# TO be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named
# by the plugin_dir system variable).
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# The plugin library file base name is keyring_udf. The file name suffix differs per platform (for example,
# .so is UNIX based, .dll for Windows)
#
# To install the keyring_udf plugin and the UDFs, use the INSTALL_PLUGIN and CREATE_FUNCTION statements
# (Adjust the .so suffix if need be):
#
# INSTALL PLUGIN keyring_udf SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_generate RETURNS INTEGER
# 		SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_fetch RETURNS STRING
# 		SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_length_fetch RETURNS INTEGER
# 		SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_type_fetch RETURNS STRING
# 		SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_store RETURNS INTEGER
# 		SOANME 'keyring_udf.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_remove RETURNS INTEGER
# 		SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
#
# If the plugin and UDFs are used on a master replication server, install them on all slave servers as well, to avoid replication
# problems.
#
# Once installed as just described, the plugin and UDFs remain installed until uninstalled.
#
# To remove them, use the UNINSTALL_PLUGIN and DROP_FUNCTION statements:
#
# 		UNINSTALL PLUGIN keyring_udf;
# 		DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_generate;
# 		DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_fetch;
# 		DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_length_ fetch;
#
# 		DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_type_fetch;
# 		DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_store;
# 		DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_remove;
#
# USING GENERAL-PURPOSE KEYRING FUNCTIONS
#
# Before using the keyring user-defined functions (UDFs), install them according to the instructions provided later.
#
# The keyring UDFs are subject to these constraints:
#
# 		) To use any keyring UDF, the keyring_udf plugin must be enabled.
# 			Otherwise, an error occurs:
#
# 			ERROR 1123 (HY000): Can't initialize function 'keyring_key_generate';
# 			This function requires keyring_udf plugin which is not installed.
# 			Please install
#
# 			To install the keyring_udf plugin, see later.
#
# 		) The keyring UDFs invoke keyring service (see later)
#
# 			These service functions in turn use whatever keyring plugin is installed
# 			(for example, keyring_file or keyring_okv).
#
# 			Therefore, to use any keyring UDF, some underlying keyring plugin must be installed.
#
# 			Otherwise, an error occurs:
#
# 				ERROR 3188 (HY000): Function 'keyring_key_generate' failed because underlying keyring
# 				service returned an error.
#
# 				Please check if a keyring plugin is installed and that provided arguments are valid for the
# 				keyring you are using.
#
# 			To install a keyring plugin, see earlier.
#
# 		) To use any keyring UDF, a user must possess the global EXECUTE privilege.
# 			Otherwise, an error occurs:
#
# 				ERROR 1123 (HY000): Can't initialize function 'keyring_key_generate';
# 				The user is not privileged to execute this function.
# 				Use needs EXECUTE privilege.
#
# 			To grant the global EXECUTE privilege, use this statement:
#
# 				GRANT EXECUTE ON *.* TO user;
#
# 			Alternatively, should you prefer to avoid granting the global EXECUTE privilege while still permitting
# 			users to access specific key-management operations, "wrapper" stored programs can be defined
# 			(a technique described later in this section)
#
# 		) A key stored in the keyring by a given user can be manipulated later only by the same user.
#
# 			That is, the value of the CURRENT_USER() function at the time of key manipulation, must have the
# 			same value as when the key was stored in the keyring.
#
# 			(This constraint rules out the use of the keyring UDFs for manipulation of instance-wide keys, such as
# 			those created by InnoDB support tablespace encryption)
#
# 			To enable multiple users to perform operations on the same key, "wrapper" stored programs can be defined
# 			(a technique described later in these sections)
#
# 		) Keyring UDFs support the key types and lengths supported by the underlying keyring plugin, with the additional
# 			constraint that keys cannot be longer than 2,048 bytes (16,384 bits), due to limitations on the UDF interface.
#
# TO create a new random key and store it in the keyring, call keyring_key_generate(), passing to it an ID for the key,
# along with the key type (encryption method) and its length in bytes.
#
# The following call creates a 2,048-bit DSA-encrypted key named MyKey
#
# SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'DSA', 256);
# +------------------------------------------------+
# | keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'DSA', 256) 		|
# +------------------------------------------------+
# | 														1 		|
# +------------------------------------------------+
#
# a return value of 1 indicates success.
#
# IF the key cannot be created, the return value is NULL and an error occurs.
# One reason this might occur, is that hte underlying keyring plugin does not support the specified
# combination of key type and key length. See earlier.
#
# To be able to check the return type regardless of whether an error occurs, use SELECT ... INTO @var_name and
# test the variable value:
#
# SELECT keyring_key_generate('','',-1) INTO @x;
# ERROR 3188 (HY000): Function 'keyring_key_generate' failed because underlying keyring service
# returned an error.
#
# Please check if a keyring plugin is installed and that provided arguments are valid for the keyring
# you are using.
#
# SELECT @x;
# +--------+
# | @x 	  |

# SELECT @x;
# +--------+
# | @x 	  |
# +--------+
# | 		1 |
# +--------+
#
# This technique also applies to other keyring UDFs that for failure return a value and an error.
#
# The ID passed to keyring_key_generate() provides a means by which to refer ot the key in subsequent UDF calls.
# For example, use the key ID to retrieve its type as a string or its length in bytes as an integer.
#
# SELECT keyring_key_type_fetch('MyKey');
# +--------------------------------------+

# | keyring_key_length_fetch('MyKey') 		|
# +---------------------------------------+
# | 					256 							|
# +---------------------------------------+
#
# To retrieve a key value, pass the key ID to keyring_key_fetch().
#
# The following example uses HEX() to display the key value because it may contain nonprintable
# chars.
#
# The example also uses a short key for brevity, but be aware that longer keys provide better security:
#
# SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyShortKey', 'DSA' 8);
# +---------------------------------------------------+
# | keyring_key_generate('MyShortKey', 'DSA', 8) 		|
# +---------------------------------------------------+
# | 																1 	|
# +---------------------------------------------------+

# SELECT HEX(keyring_key_fetch('MyShortKey'));
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | HEX(keyring_key_fetch('MyShortKey')) 				 |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | <value> 													 |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
#
# Keyring UDFs treat key IDs, types and values as binary strings, so comparisons are case-sensitive.
# For example, IDs of MyKey and mykey refer to different keys.
#
# To remove a key, pass the key ID to keyring_key_remove():
#
# 	SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
# +-----------------------------------+
# | keyring_key_remove('MyKey') 		  |
# +-----------------------------------+
# | 1 										  |
# +-----------------------------------+
#
# To obfuscate and store a key that you provide, pass the key ID, type and value to keyring_key_store():
#
# 	SELECT keyring_key_store('AES_key', 'AES', 'Secret string');
# +------------------------------------------------------------+
# | keyring_key_store('AES_key', 'AES', 'Secret string') 		|
# +------------------------------------------------------------+

# +------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# As indicated previously, a user must have the global EXECUTE privilege to call keyring UDFs, and the user who
# stores a key in the keyring initially must be the same user who performs subsequent operations on the key later, as determined
# from the CURRENT_USER() value in effect for each UDF call.
#
# To permit key operations to users who do not have the global EXECUTE privilege, or who may not be the
# key "owner", use this technique:
#
# 1. Define "wrapper" stored programs that encapsulate the required key operations and have a DEFINER value equal to the key owner.
#
# 2. Grant the EXECUTE privilege for specific stored programs to the individual users who should be able to invoke them.
#
# 3. If the operations implemented by the wrapper stored programs do not include key creation, create any necessary keys in advance,
# 		using the account named as the DEFINER in the stored program definitions.
#
# This technique enables keys to be shared among users and provides to DBAs more fine-grained control over who can do what
# with keys, without having to grant global privs.
#
# The following eample shows how to set up a shared key named SharedKey that is owned by the DBA, and a get_shared_key()
# stored function that provides access to the current key value.
#
# THe value can be retrieved by any user with the EXECUTE privilege for that function, which is created in the key_schema schema.
#
# From a MySQL administrative account ('root'@'localhost' in this example), create the administrative schema and the stored
# function to access the key:
#
# CREATE SCHEMA key_schema;
#
# CREATE DEFINER = 'root'@'localhost'
# FUNCTION key_schema.get_shared_key()
# RETURNS BLOB READS SQL DATA 
# RETURN keyring_key_fetch('SharedKey');
#
# From the administrative account, ensure that the shared key exists:
#
# SELECT keyring_key_generate('SharedKey', 'DSA', 8);
# +----------------------------------------------+
# | keyring_key_generate('SharedKey', 'DSA', 8)  |
# +----------------------------------------------+
# | 														1 	 |
# +----------------------------------------------+
#
# From the administrative account, create an ordinary user account to which key access is to be granted:
#
# CREATE USER 'key_user'@'localhost'
# IDENTIFIED BY 'key_user_pwd';
#
# From the key_user account, verify that without the proper EXECUTE privilege, the new account cannot
# access the shared key:
#
# SELECT HEX(key_schema.get_shared_key());
# ERROR 1370 (42000): execute command denied ot user 'key_user'@'localhost'
# for routine 'key_schema.get_shared_key'
#
# For the administrative account, grant EXECUTE to key_user for the stored function:
#
# GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION key_schema.get_shared_key TO 'key_user'@'localhost';
#
# From the key_user account, verify that the key is now accessible:
#
# SELECT HEX(key_schema.get_shared_key());
# +--------------------------------------+
# | HEX(key_schema.get_shared_key()) 	  |

# PLUGIN-SPECIFIC KEYRING KEY-MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
#
# For each keyring plugin-specific user-defined function (UDF), this section describes its purpose, calling sequence, and return value.
#
# For information about general-purpose keyring UDFs, see earlier.
#
# ) keyring_aws_rotate_cmk()
#
# 		This UDF is associated with the keyring_aws plugin. Its use requires the SUPER Privilege.
#
# 		keyring_aws_rotate_cmk() rotates the customer master key (CMK).
# 		Rotation changes only the key that AWS KMS uses for subsequent data key-encryption operations.
#
# 		AWS KMS maintains previous CMK versions, so keys generated using previous CMKs remain decryptable
# 		after rotation.
#
# 		Rotation changes the CMK values used inside AWS KMS but does not change the ID used to refer to it,
# 		so there is no need to change the keyring_aws_cmk_id system variable after calling keyring_aws_rotate_cmk().
#
# 		Arguments: NONE
#
# 		Return value: Returns 1 for success, or NULL and an error for failure.
#
# ) keyring_aws_rotate_keys()
#
# 		This UDF is associated with the keyring_aws plugin. Its use requires the SUPER privilege.
#
# 		keyring_aws_rotate_keys() rotates keys stored in the keyring_aws storage file named by the keyring_aws_data_file
# 		system variable.
#
# 		Rotation sends each key stored in the to AWS KMS for re-encryption using the value of the keyring_aws_cmk_id system
# 		variable as the CMK value, and stores the new encrypted keys in the file.
#
# 		keyring_aws_rotate_keys() is useful for key re-encryption under these circumnstances:
#
# 			) After rotating the CMK; that is, after invoking the keyring_aws_rotate_cmk() UDF
#
# 			) After changing the keyring_aws_cmk_id system variable to a different key value
#
# 		Arguments: None
#
# 		Return value:. 1 for success, NULL and an error for failure.
#
# KEYRING COMMAND OPTIONS
#
# MySQL supports the following keyring-related command-line options:
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-destination=plugin
#
# 			Property 			Value
# 			Cmd line: 			--keyring-migration-destination=plugin_name
# 			Introduced: 		8.0.4
# 			Type: 				String
#
# 			The destination keyring plugin for key migration.
# 			See later.
#
# 			The format and interpretation of the option value is the same as described
# 			for the --keyring-migration-source option.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				--keyring-migration-source and --keyring-migration-destination are mandatory for all keyring
# 				migration operations.
#
# 				The source and destination plugins must differ, and the migration server must support both plugins.
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-host=host_name
#
# 			Property 			Value
# 			Cmd line: 			--keyring-migration-host=host_name
# 			Introduced: 		8.0.4
# 			Type: 				String
# 			Default: 			localhost
#
# 			The host location of the running server that is currently using one of the key migration keystores.
# 			See later.
#
# 			Migration always occurs on the local host, so the option always specifies a value for connecting to a local server,
# 			such as localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1 or the local host IP address or host name.
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-password[=password]
#
# 			Property 			Value
# 			Cmd line: 			--keyring-migration-password[=password]
# 			Introduced: 		8.0.4
# 			Type: 				String
#
# 			The password for connecting to the running server that is currently using one of the key migration
# 			keystores.
#
# 			See later.
#
# 			If you omit the password value following the option name on the command line, the server prompts for one.
#
# 			Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure.
# 			See earlier.
#
# 			You can use an option file to avoid giving the password on the command line.
# 			In this case, the file should have a restrictive mode and be accessible only to the account
# 			used to run the migration server.
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-port=port_num
#
# 			Property 			Value
# 			Cmd line: 			--keyring-migration-port=port_num
# 			Introdued: 			8.0.4
# 			Type 					Numeric
# 			Default: 			3306
#
# 			For TCP/IP connections, the port number for connecting to the running server that is currently
# 			using one of the key migration keystores.
#
# 			See later.
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-socket=path
#
# 			Property 			Value
# 			Cmd line: 			--keyring-migration-socket={file_name|pipe_name}
# 			Introduced: 		8.0.4
# 			Type: 				String
#
# 			For Unix socket file or Windows named pipe connections, the socket file
# 			or named pipe for connecting to the running server that is currently using one of the
# 			key migration keystores.
#
# 			See previous.
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-source=plugin
#
# 			Property 			Value
# 			Cmd line: 			--keyring-migration-source=plugin_name
# 			Introduced: 		8.0.4
# 			Type: 				String
#
# 			The source keyring plugin for key migration. See earlier.
#
# 			The option value is similar to that for --plugin-load, except that only one plugin library can be specified.
# 			The value is given as name=plugin_library or plugin_library.
#
# 			The name is the name of a plugin to load, and plugin_library is the name of the library
# 			file that contains the plugin code.
#
# 			If the plugin library is named without any preceding plugin name, the server loads all plugins in the library.
# 			The server looks for plugin library files in the directory named by the plugin_dir system variable.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				--keyring-migration-source and --keyring-migration-destination are mandatory for all keyring
# 				migration operations.
#
# 				The source and destination plugins must differ, and the migration server must support both plugins.
#
# 		) --keyring-migration-user=user_name
#
# 			Property 			Value
# 			Cmd line: 			--keyring-migration-user=user_name
# 			Introduced: 		8.0.4
# 			Type: 				String
#
# 			The user name for connecting to the running server that is currently using one of the key migration keystores.
# 			See previous.

# KEYRING SYSTEM VARIABLES
#
# MySQL Keyring plugins support the following system variables.
# Use them to configure keyring plugin operation.
#
# These variables are unavailable unless the appropriate keyring plugin is installed.
#
# ) keyring_aws_cmk_id
#
# 	Property 				Value
# 	Cmd line: 				--keyring-aws-cmk-id
# 	Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 	System var: 			keyring_aws_cmk_id
# 	Scope: 					Global
# 	Dynamic: 				Yes
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 	Type: 					String
#
# 	The customer master key (CMK) ID obtained from the AWS KMS server and used by the keyring_aws plugin.
#
# 	This variable is unavailable unless that plugin is installed, but if it is installed, a value
# 	for this variable is mandatory.
#
# ) keyring_aws_conf_file
#
# 	Property 				Value
# 	Cmd line: 				--keyring-aws-conf-file
# 	Introduced:: 			8.0.11
# 	System var: 			keyring_aws_conf_file
# 	Scope: 					Global
# 	Dynamic: 				No
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 	Type: 					File name
# 	Default: 				platform specific
#
# 	The location of the configuration file for the keyring_aws keyring plugin.
# 	This variable is unavailable unless that plugin is installed.
#
# 	At plugin startup, keyring_aws reads the AWS secret access key ID and key from the configuration file.
#
# 	For the keyring_aws plugin to start successfully, the configuration file must exist and contain
# 	valid secret access key information, initialized as previously described.
#
# 	The default file name is keyring_aws_conf, located in the default keyring file directory.
# 	The location of this default directory is the same as for the keyring_file_data system variable.
#
# 	See the description of that variable for details, as well as for considerations to take into account if you
# 	create the directory manually.
#
# ) keyring_aws_data_file
#
# 	Property 				Value
# 	Cmd line: 				--keyring-aws-data-file
# 	Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 	System variable: 		keyring_aws_data_file
# 	Scope: 					Global
# 	Dynamic: 				No
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 	Type: 					File name
# 	Default: 				platform specific
#
# 	The location of the storage file for the keyring_aws keyring plugin.
# 	This variable is unavailable unless that plugin is installed.
#
# 	At plugin startup, if the value assigned to keyring_aws_data_file specifies a file
# 	that does not exist, the keyring_aws plugin attempts to create it (as well as its parent
# 	directory, if necessary).
#
# 	If the file does exist, keyring_aws reads any encrypted keys contained in the file into
# 	its in-memory cache.
#
# 	keyring_aws does not cache unencrypted keys in memory.
#
# 	The default file name is keyring_aws_data, located in the default keyring file directory.
#
# 	The location of this default directory is the same as for the keyring_file_data
# 	system variable.
#
# 	See the description of that variable for details, as well as for considerations to take into
# 	account if you create the directory manually.
#
# ) keyring_aws_region
#
# 	Property 				Value
# 	Cmd line: 				--keyring-aws-region
# 	Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 	Sys var: 				keyring_aws_region

#
# ) keyring_encrypted_file_data
#
# 	Property 				Value
# 	Cmd line: 				--keyring-encrypted-file-data=file_name
# 	Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 	System variable: 		keyring_encrypted_file_data
# 	Scope: 					Global
# 	Dynamic: 				Yes
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 	Type: 					File name
# 	Default: 				platform specific
#
# 	The path name of the data file used for secure data storage by the keyring_encrypted_file plugin.
# 	This variable is unavailable unless that plugin is installed.
#
# 	The file location should be in a directory considered for use only by the keyring plugins.
# 	For example, do not locate the file under the data directory.
#
# 	Keyring operations are transactional: The keyring_encrypted_file plugin uses a backup file during write
# 	operations to ensure that it can roll back to the original file if an operation fails.
#
# 	The backup file has the same name as the value of the keyring_encrypted_file_data system variable with a suffix of .backup
#
# 	Do not use the same keyring_encrypted_file data file for multiple MySQL instances.
# 	Each instance should have its own unique data file.
#
# 	The default file name is keyring_encrypted, located in a directory that is platform specific and depends on the
# 	value of the INSTALL_LAYOUT CMake option, as shown in the following table.
#
# 	To specify the default directory for the file explicitly if you are building from source,
# 	use the INSTALL_MYSQLKEYRINGDIR CMake option.
#
# 	INSTALL_LAYOUT value 				Default keyring_encrypted_file_data Value
#
# 	DEB, RPM, SLES, SVR4 				/var/lib/mysql-keyring/keyring_encrypted 
#
# 	Otherwise 								keyring/keyring_encrypted under the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value
#
# 	At plugin startup, if the value assigned to keyring_encrypted_file_data specifies a file that does not exist,
# 	the keyring_encrypted_file plugin attempts to create it (as well as its parent directory, if necessary)
#
# 	If you create the directory manually, it should have a restrictive mode and be accessible only to the
# 	account used to run the MySQL server.
#
# 	For example, on UNIX based systems, to use the /usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring directory, the following commands
# 	(executed as root) create the directory and set its mode and ownership:
#
# 	cd /usr/local/mysql
# 	mkdir mysql-keyring
# 	chmod 750 mysql-keyring
# 	chown mysql mysql-keyring
# 	chgrp mysql mysql-keyring
#
# 	If the keyring_encrypted_file plugin cannot create or access its data file, it writes an error message
# 	to the error log.
#
# 	If an attempted rutime assignment to keyring_encrypted_file_data results in an error, the variable value remains unchanged.
#
# 	Important:
#
# 		Once the keyring_encrypted_file plugin has created its data file and started to use it, it is important
# 		not to remove the file.
#
# 		Loss of the file will cause data encrypted using its keys to become inaccessible.

# 	Cmd line: 							--keyring-encrypted-file-password=password
# 	Introduced: 						8.0.11
# 	System variable: 					keyring_encrypted_file_password
#	Scope: 								Global
# 	Dynamic: 							Yes
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 						No
# 	Type: 								String
#
# 	The password used by the keyring_encrypted_file plugin.
# 	This variable is unavailable unless that plugin is installed.
#
# 	The password is mandatory for plugin operation; if not specified at server startup,
# 	keyring_encrypted_file initialization fails.
#
# 	If this variable is specified in an option file, the file should have a restrictive mode
# 	and be accessible only to the account used to run the MySQL server.
#
# 	Important:
#		Once the keyring_encrypted_file_password value has been set, changing it does not rotate the
# 		keyring password and could make the server inaccessible.
#
# 		If an incorrect password is provided, the keyring_encrypted_file plugin cannot load keys
# 		from the encrypted keyring file.
#
# 	The password value cannot be displayed at runtime with SHOW_VARIABLES or the Performance Schema
# 	global_variables table because the display value is obfuscated.

# Property 								Value
# Cmd line: 							--keyring-file-data=file_name
# System variable: 					keyring_file_data
# Scope: 								Global
# Dynamic: 								Yes
# SET_VAR Hint: 						No
# Type: 									File name
# Default value: 						platform specific
#
# THe path name of the data file used for secure data storage by the keyring_file plugin.
# This  variable is unavailable unless that plugin is installed.
#
# The file location should be in a directory considered for use only by the keyring plugins.
# For example, do not locate the file under the data directory.
#
# Keyring operations are transactional: The keyring_file plugin uses a backup file during 
# write operations to ensure that it can roll back to the original file if an operation fails.
#
# The backup file has the same name as the value of the keyring_file_data system variable with a suffix of .backup
#
# Do not use the same keyring_file data file for multiple MySQL instances.
# Each instance should have its own unique data file.
#
# The default file name is keyring, located in a directory that is platform specific and depends on
# the value of the INSTALL_LAYOUT CMake option, as shown as follows.
#
# To specify the default directory for the file explicitly if you are building from source,
# use the INSTALL_MYSQLKEYRINGDIR CMake option.
#
# INSTALL_LAYOUT Value 					Default keyring_file_data Value
#
# DEB, RPM, SLES, SVR4 					/var/lib/mysql-keyring/keyring  
#
# Otherwise 								keyring/keyring under the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value
#
# At plugin startup, if the value assigned to keyring_file_data specifies a file that does not exist,
# the keyring_file plugin attempts to create it (as well as its parent directory, if called for)
#
# If you create the directory manually, it should have a restrictive mode and be accessible only to the
# account used to run the MySQL server.
#
# For example, on Unix and UNIX based systems, to use the /usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring directory, the following
# commands (executed as root) create the directory and set its mode and ownership:
#
# 		cd /usr/local/mysql
# 		mkdir mysql-keyring
# 		chmod 750 mysql-keyring
# 		chown mysql mysql-keyring
# 		chgrp mysql mysql-keyring
#
# If the keyring_file plugin cannot create or access its data file, it writes an error message to the error log.
#
# If an attempted runtime assignment to keyring_file_data results in an error, the variable value remains unchanged.
#
# Important:
#
# 		Once the keyring_file plugin has created its data file and started to use it, it is important not to remove the file.
#
# 		For example, InnoDB uses the file to store the master key used to decrypt the data in tables that use
# 		InnoDB tablespace encryption, see more later.
#
# 		Loss of the file will cause data in such tables to become inaccessible.
#
# 		(It is permissible to rename or move the file, as long as you change the value of keyring_file_data to match)
#
# 		It is recommended that you create a separate backup of the keyring data file immediately after you
# 		create the first encrypted table and before and after master key rotation.
#
# ) keyring_okv_conf_dir
#
# 	Property 						Value
# 	Cmd line:						--keyring-okv-conf-dir=dir_name
# 	Introduced: 					8.0.11
# 	System variable: 				keyring_okv_conf_dir
# 	Scope: 							Global
# 	Dynamic: 						Yes
# 	SET_VAR Hint: 					No
# 	Type: 							Directory name
# 	Default: 						empty string
#
# The path name of the directory that stores configuration information used by the keyring_okv plugin.
# This variable is unavailable unless that plugin is installed.
#
# The location should be a directory considered for use only by the keyring_okv plugin.
#
# For example, do not locate the directory under the data directory.
#
# The default keyring_okv_conf_dir value is empty.
#
# For the keyring_okv plugin to be able to access Oracle Key Vault, the value must be set
# to a directory that contains Oracle Key Vault configuration and SSL materials.
#
# For instructions on setting up this directory, see earlier.
#
# The directory should have a restrictive mode and be accessible only to the account used
# to run the MySQL server.
#
# For example, on UNIX based systems, to use the /usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring-okv directory,
# the following commands (executed as root) create the directory and set its mode and ownership:
#
# 	cd /usr/local/mysql
# 	mkdir mysql-keyring-okv
# 	chmod 750 mysql-keyring-okv
# 	chown mysql mysql-keyring-okv
# 	chgrp mysql mysql-keyring-okv
#
# If the value assigned to keyring_okv_conf_dir specifies a directory that does not exist, or that does
# not contain configuration information that enables a connection to Oracle Key Vault to be established, keyring_okv
# writes an error message to the error log.
#
# If an attempted runtime assignment to keyring_okv_conf_dir results in an error, the variable and keyring operation remain
# unchanged.

#
# MYSQL ENTERPRISE AUDIT
#
# Note:
# 		MySQL Enterprise Audit is an extension included in MySQL EE.
#
# MySQL EE includes MysQL Enterprise Audit, implemented using a server plugin named audit_log.
#
# MySQL Enterprise Audit uses the open MySQL Audit API to enable standard, policy-based monitoring, logging and
# blocking of connection and query activity executed on specific MySQL servers.
#
# Designed to meet Oracle audit specification, MysQL Enterprise Audit provides a out of the box, easy to use Auditing
# and compliance solution for applications that are governed by both internal and external regulatory guidelines.
#
# When installed, the audit plugin enables MySQL Server to produce a log file containing an audit record of server activity.
#
# The log contents include when clients connect and disconnect, and what actions they perform while connected,
# such as which databases and tables they access.
#
# After you install the audit plugin, it writes an audit log file.
#
# By default, the file is named audit.log in the server data directory.
#
# To change the name of the file, set the audit_log_file system variable at server startup.
#
# By default, audit log file contents are written in new-style XML format, without compression or encryption.
# To select the file format, set the audit_log_format system variable at server startup.
#
# For details on file formats and contents, see later.
#
# For more information about controlling how logging occurs, including audit log file naming and format selection,
# see later.
#
# To perform filtering of audited events, see later.
#
# For descriptions of the parameters used to configure the audit log plugin, se later.
#
# If the audit log plugin is enabled, the Performance Schema has instrumentation for it.
# To identify such relevant instruments, use this query:
#
# 		SELECT NAME FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments WHERE NAME LIKE '%/alog/%';
#
# AUDIT LOG COMPONENTS
#
# MySQL Enterprise Audit is based on the audit log plugin and related components:
#
# 		) A server-side plugin named audit_log examines auditable events and determines whether to write them to the audit log.
#
# 		) User-defined functions enable manipulation of filtering definitions that control logging behavior, the encryption PW and log file reading.
#
# 		) Tables in the mysql system database provide persistent storage of filter and user account data.
#
# 		) System variables enable audit log configuration and status variables provide runtime operational information.
#
# 		) An AUDIT_ADMIN privilege enable users to administer the audit log.
#
# INSTALLING OR UNINSTALLING MySQL ENTERPRISE AUDIT
#
# This section describes how to install or uninstall MySQL Enterprise Audit, which is implemented using
# the audit log plugin and related components described later.
#
# For general information about installation plugins, see earlier.
#
# Note:
# 		If installed, the audit_log plugin involves some minimal overhead even when disabled.
# 		To avoid this overhead, do not install MySQL Enterprise Audit unless you plan to use it.
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory
# (the directory named by the plugin_dir system variable).
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# To install MySQL Enterprise Audit, look in the share directory of your MySQL installation and choose the
# script that is appropriate for your platform.
#
# The available scripts differ in the suffix used to refer to the plugin library file:
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_win_install.sql: Choose this script for Windows systems that use .dll as the file name suffix.
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_linux_install.sql: Choose this script for Linux and similar systems that use the .so file name suffix.
#
# Run the script as follows. The examples here use the Linux installation script.
# Make the appropriate substitution for your system.
#
# mysql -u root -p < audit_log_filter_linux_install.sql
# Enter password: (enter root password here)
#
# Note:
#
# 		Some MySQL versions have introduced changes to the structure of the MySQL Enterprise Audit tables.
# 		To ensure that your tables are up to date for upgrades from earlier than 8.0, run mysql_update --force (which will also perform any other needed updates).
#
# 		If you prefer to run the update statements only for the MySQL Enterprise Audit tables, see the 
# 		following discussion.
#
# 		As of MySQL 8.0.12, for new MySQL installations, the USER and HOST columns in the audit_log_user table
# 		used by MySQL Enterprise Audit have definitions that better correspond ot the definitions of the User
# 		and Host columns in the mysql.user system table.
#
# 		FOr upgrades to an installation for which MySQL Enterprise Audit is already installed, it is recommended
# 		that you alter the table defs as follows:
#
# 			ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
# 				DROP FOREIGN KEY audit_log_user_ibfk_1;
#
# 			ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_filter
# 				CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_ci;
#
# 			ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
# 				CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_ci;
#
# 			ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
# 				MODIFY COLUMN USER VARCHAR(32);
#
# 			ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
# 				ADD FOREIGN KEY (FILTERNAME) REFERENCES mysql.audit_log_filter(NAME);
#
# To verify plugin installation, examine the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS table or use the SHOW_PLUGINS
# statement.
#
# For example:
#
# SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'audit%';
# +------------------------------+
# | PLUGIN_NAME 	| PLUGIN_STATUS|
# +------------------------------+
# | audit_log 		| ACTIVE 		|
# +------------------------------+
#
# If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for diagnostic messages.
#
# After MySQL Enterprise Audit is installed, you can use the --audit-log option for subsequent server startups
# to control audit_log plugin activation.
#
# For example, to prevent the plugin from being removed at runtime, use this option:
#
# 	[mysqld]
# 	audit-log=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
#
# If it is desired to prevent the server from running without the audit plugin, use --audit-log with
# a value of FORCE or FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT to force server startup to fail if the plugin does not initialize successfully.
#
# Important:
#
# 		By default, rule-based audit log filtering logs no auditable events for any users.
#
# 		This differs from legacy audit log behavior, which logs all auditable events for all users.
#
# 		SHould you wish to produce log-everything behavior with rule-based filtering, create
# 		a simple filter to enable logging and assign it to the default account:
#
# 			SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_all', '{ "filter": { "log": true } }');
# 			SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('%', 'log_all');
#
# 		The filter assigned to % is used for connections from any account that has no explicitly assigned filter (which initially
# 		is true for all accounts)
#
# Once installed as just described, MySQL Enterprise Audit remains installed until uninstalled.
# TO remove it, execute the following statements:
#
# DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mysql.audit_log_filter;
# DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mysql.audit_log_user;
# UNINSTALL PLUGIN audit_log;
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_set_filter;
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_remove_filter;
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_set_user;
#
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_remove_user;
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_flush;
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_encryption_password_get;
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_encryption_password_set;
#
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_read;
# DROP FUNCTION audit_log_read_bookmark;
#
# MySQL ENTERPRISE AUDIT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
#
# By default, contents of audit log files produced by the audit log plugin are not encrypted and may
# contain sensetive information, such as the text of SQL statements.
#
# For security reasons, audit log files should be written to a directory accessibly only to the MySQL
# server and to users with a legitimate reason to view the log.
#
# The default file name is audit.log in the data directory.
#
# This can be changed by setting the audit_log_file system variable at server startup.
#
# Other audit log files may exist due to log rotation.
#
# For additional security, enable audit log file encryption.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE FORMATS
#
# The MySQL server calls the audit log plugin to write an audit record to its log file whenever
# an auditable event occurs.
#
# Typically, ,the first audit record written after plugin startup contains the server description and
# startup options.
#
# Elements following that one represents events such as client connect and disconnect events,
# executed SQL statements and so forth.
#
# Only top-level statements are logged, not statements within stored programs such as triggers
# or stored procedures.
#
# Contents of files referenced by statements such as LOAD_DATA_INFILE are not logged.
#
# To select the logging format that the audit log plugin uses to write its log file,
# set the audit_log_format system variable at server startup.
#
# These formats are available:
#
# 		) Old-style XML format (audit_log_format=OLD): The original audit logging format used by default in older MySQL series.
#
# 		) New-style XML format (audit_log_format=NEW): An XML format that has better compatibility with Oracle Audit Vault than old-style
# 			XML format.
#
# 			MySQL 8.0 uses new-style XML format by default.
#
# 		) JSON format (audit_log_format=JSON)
#
# By default, audit log file contents are written in new-style XML format, without compression or encryption.
#
# NOTE:
# 		FOr information about issues to consider when changing log format, see Audit Log File Format.
#
# OLD-STYLE XML AUDIT LOG FILE FORMAT
#
# Here is a sample log file in old-style XML format (audit_log_format=OLD), reformatted slightly for readability:
#
# 	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

# 		SERVER_ID="1"/>
# 	</AUDIT>
#
#
# The audit log file is written as XML, using UTF-8 (up to 4 bytes per character).
#
# The root element is <AUDIT>. The root element contains <AUDIT_RECORD> elements, each of which provides
# information about an audited event. 
#
# When the audit log plugin begins writing a new log file, it writes the XML declaration and opening
# <AUDIT> root element tag.
#
# When the plugin closes a log file, it writes the closing </AUDIT> root element tag.
# The closing tag is not present while the file is open.
#
# Attributes of <AUDIT_RECORD> elements have these characteristics:
#
# 		) Some attributes appear in every <AUDIT_RECORD> element. 
#  		Others are optional and may appear depending on the audit record type.
#
# 		) Order of attributes within an <AUDIT_RECORD> element is not guaranteed.
#
# 		) Attribute values are not fixed length.
# 			Long values may be truncated as indicated in teh attribute desc. given later.
#
# 		) The <,>, " and &  chars are encoded as &lt;, &gt;, &quot; and &amp; respectively.
#  			NUL bytes (U+00) are encoded as the ? char.
#
# 		) Characters not valid as XML characters are encoded using numeric character references.
# 			Valid XML characters are:
#
# 				#x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]
#
# The following attributes are mandatory in every <AUDIT_RECORD> element:
#
# ) NAME:
# 
#  	A string representing the type of instruction that generated the audit event, such as a command that hte server received from a client.
#
# 		Example: NAME="Query"
#
# 		Some common NAME values:
#
# 			Audit 	When auditing starts, which may be server startup time
#
# 			Connect 	When a client connects, also known as logging in			 
#
# 			Query 	An SQL statement (executed directly)
#
# 			Prepare 	Preparation of an SQL statement; usually followed by Execute
#
# 			Execute 	Execution of an SQL statement; usually follows Prepare
#
# 			Shutdown Server shutdown
#
# 			Quit 		When a client disconnects
#
# 			NoAudit 	Auditing has been turned off
#
# 		The possible values are: Audit, Binlog, Dump, Change user, Close stmt, Connect out, Connect, Create DB, Daemon, Debug, Delayed
# 											insert, Drop DB, Execute, Fetch, Field List, Init, DB, Kill, Long, Data, NoAudit, Ping, Prepare
#
# 											Processlist, Query, Quit, Refresh, Register Slave, Reset stmt, Set option, Shutdown, Sleep,
# 											Statistics, Table Dump, Time
#
# 		With the exception of "Audit" and "NoAudit", these values correspond to the COM_XXX command values listed in the my_command.h header file.
# 		For example, "Create DB" and "Change user" correspond to COM_CREATE_DB and COM_CHANGE_USER, respectively.
#
# ) RECORD_ID:
#
# 		A unique identifier for the audit record.
#
# 		The value is composed from a sequence number and timestamp, in the format SEQ_TIMESTAMP. 
#
# 		When the audit log plugin opens the audit log file, it initializes the sequence number to the size of the audit log file,
# 		then increments the sequence by 1 for each record logged.
#
# 		The timestamp is a UTC value in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss format indicating the date and time when the
# 		audit log plugin opened the file.
#
# 		Example: RECORD_ID="12_2017-10-16T14:25:00"
#
# ) TIMESTAMP:
#
# 		A string representing a UTC value in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss UTC format indicating the date and time when the audit event
# 		was generated.
#
# 		For example, the event corresponding to execution of an SQL statement received from a client has a TIMESTAMP value
# 		occuring after the statement finishes, not when it was received.
#
# 		Example: TIMESTAMP="2017-10-16T14:25:32 UTC"
#
# The following attributes are optional in <AUDIT_RECORD> elements.
#
# Many of them occur only for elements with specific values of the NAME attribute:
#
# ) COMMAND_CLAS
#
# 		A string that indicates the type of action performed.
#
# 		Example: COMMAND_CLASS="drop_table"
#
# 		The values correspond to the statement /sql/xxx command counters; for example, xxx
# 		is drop_table and select for DROP_TABLE and SELECT statements, respectively.
#
# 		The following statement displays the possible names:
#
# 			SELECT REPLACE(EVENT_NAME, 'statement/sql/', '') AS name
# 			FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name
# 			WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'statement/sql/%'
# 			ORDER BY name;
#
# ) CONNECTION_ID
#
# 		A unsigned integer representing the client connection identifier.
#
# 		This is the same as the value returned by the CONNECTION_ID() function within the session.
#
# 		Example: CONNECTION_ID="127"
#
# ) CONNECTION_TYPE
#
# 		The security state of the connection to the server.
# 		Permitted values are TCP/IP (TCP/IP connections established without encryption),
# 		SSL/TLS (TCP/IP connection established with encryption),
# 		Socket (Unix socket file connection),
# 		Named Pipe (Windows named pipe connection),
# 		and Shared Memory (Windows shared memory connection)
#
# 		Example: CONNECTION_TYPE="SSL/TLS"
#
# ) DB
#
# 		A string representing the default database name.
#
# 		Example: DB="test"
#
# ) HOST
#
# 		A string representing the client host name
#
# 		Example: HOST="localhost"
#
# ) IP
#
# 		A string representing the client IP address.
#
# 		Example: IP="127.0.0.1"
#
# ) MYSQL_VERSION
#
# 		A string representing the MySQL server version.
#
# 		This is the same as the value of the VERSION() function or version system variable.
#
# 		Example: MYSQL_VERSION="5.7.21-log"
#
# ) OS_LOGIN
#
# 		A string representing the external user name used during the authentication process, as set by
# 		the plugin used to authenticate the client.
#
# 		With native (built-in) MySQL authentication, or if the plugin does not set the value, this attribute is empty.
#
# 		The value is the same as that of the external_user system variable.
#
# 		Example: OS_LOGIN="jeffrey"
#
# ) OS_VERSION
#
# 		A string representing the operating system on which the server was built or is running.
#
# 		Example: OS_VERSION="x86_64-Linux"
#
# ) PRIV_USER
#
# 		A string representing the user that the server authenticated the client as.
#
# 		This is the user name that hte server uses for privilege checking, and it may differ
# 		from the USER value.
#
# 		Example: PRIV_USER="jeffrey"
#
# ) PROXY_USER
#
# 		A string representing the proxy user.
# 		The value is empty if user proxying is not in effect.
#
# 		Example: PROXY_USER="developer"
#
# ) SERVER_ID
#
# 		a unsigned integer representing the server ID.
#
# 		This is the same as the value of the server_id system variable.
#
# 		Example: SERVER_ID="1"
#
# ) SQLTEXT
#
# 		A string representing the text of an SQL statement.
# 		The value can be empty. Long values may be truncated.
#
# 		The string, like the audit log file itself, is written using UTF-8 (up to 4 bytes per character),
# 		so the value may be the result of conversion.
#
# 		For example, the original statement might have been received from the client as an SJIS string.
#
# 		Example: SQLTEXT="DELETE FROM t1"
#
# ) STARTUP_OPTIONS
#
# 		A string representing the options that were given on the command line or in option files when the MySQL server was started.
#
# 		Example: STARTUP_OPTIONS="--port=3306 --log_output=FILE"
#
# ) STATUS
#
# 		An unsigned integer representing the command status: 0 for success, nonzero if an error occurred.
#
# 		This is the same as the value of the mysql_errno() C API function.
#
# 		See the description for STATUS_CODE for information about how it differs from STATUS.
#
# 		The audit log does not contain the SQLSTATE value or error message. To see theh associations between error codes,
# 		SQLSTATE values, and messages - see later.
#
# 		Warnings are not logged.
#
# 		Example: STATUS="1051"
#
# ) STATUS_CODE
#
# 		An unsigned integer representing the command status: 0 for success, 1 if an error occurred.
#
# 		The STATUS_CODE value differs from the STATUS value: STATUS_CODE is 0 for success and 1 for error, which is compatible
# 		with the EZ_collector consumer for Audit Vault.
#
# 		STATUS is the value of the mysql_errno() C API function.
#
# 		This is 0 for success and nonzero for error, and thus is not necessarily 1 for error.
#
# 		Example: STATUS_CODE="0"
#
# ) USER
#
# 		A string representing the user name sent by the client. This may differ from the PRIV_USER value.
#
# ) VERSION
#
# 		An unsigned integer representing the version of the audit log file format.
#
# 		Example: VERSION="1"
#
# NEW-STYLE XML AUDIT LOG FILE FORMAT

# 	</AUDIT>
#
# The audit log file is written as XML, using UTF-8 (up to 4 bytes per char).
# The root element is <AUDIT>. It contains the <AUDIT_RECORD> elements, each of which provides
# information about an audited event.
#
# When the audit log plugin begins writing a new log file, it writes the XML Declaration and opening <AUDIT>
# root element tag.
#
# When the plugin closes a log file, it writes the closing </AUDIT> root element tag.
#
# The closing tag is not present while the file is open.
#
# Elements within <AUDIT_RECORD> elements have these characteristics:
#
# 		) Some elements appear in every <AUDIT_RECORD> element. Others are optional and may appear depending on the audit record type.
#
# 		) Order of elements within an <AUDIT_RECORD> element is not guaranteed.
#
# 		) Element values are not fixed length. Long values may be truncated as indicated in the element descriptions given later.
# 		
# 		) The <,>,", and & characters are encoded as &lt;, &gt;, &quot; and &amp; respetively. NUL bytes (U+00) are encoded as the ? character.
#
# 		) Characters not valid as XML characters are encoded using numeric character references.
#
# 			Valid XML characters are:
#
# 			#x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]
#
# The following elements are mandatory in every <AUDIT_RECORD> element:
#
# 		) <NAME>
#
# 		a string representing the type of instruction that generated the audit event.
# 		Such as a command that the server received from a client.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			<NAME>Query</NAME>
#
# 		Some common <NAME> values:
#
# 			Audit: When auditing starts, which may be server startup time
# 			Connect: When a client connects, also known as logging in
# 			Query: An SQL statement (executed-directly)
#
# 			Prepare: Preparation of an SQL statement; usually followed by Execute
# 			Execute: Execution of an SQL statement; usually follows Prepare
# 			Shutdown: Server shutdown
# 	
# 			Quit: When a client disconnects
# 			NoAudit: Auditing has been turned off
#
# The possible values are:
#
# Audit, Binlog Dump, Change user, Close stmt, Connect Out, Connect, Create DB, Daemon, Debug, Delayed insert,
# Drop DB, Execute, Fetch, Field List, Init DB, Kill, Long Data, NoAudit, Ping, Prepare, Processlist, Query,
# Quit, Refresh, Register Slave, Reset stmt, Set option,, Shutdown, Sleep, Statistics, Table Dump, Time
#
# With the exception of Audit and NoAudit, these values correspond to the COM_xxx command values listed in
# the my_command.h header file.
#
# For example, Create DB and Change user correspond to COM_CREATE_DB and COM_CHANGE_USER, respectively.
#
# 
# ) <RECORD_ID>
#
# 		A unique identifier for the audit record. The value is composed from a sequence number and timestamp, in the format SEQ_TIMESTAMP.
#
# 		When the audit log plugin opens the audit log file, it initializes the sequence number to the size of the audit log file,
# 		then increments the sequence by 1 for each record logged.
#
# 		The timestamp is a UTC value in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss format indicating the date and time when the audit log plugin opened the file.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			<RECORD_ID>12_2017-10-16T14:06:33</RECORD_ID>
#
# ) <TIMESTAMP>
#
# 		A string representing a UTC value in YYYY-MM-DDYhh:mm:ss UTC format indicating the date and time when the audit event
# 		was generated.
#
# 		For example, the event corresponding to execution of an SQL statement received from a client has a <TIMESTAMP> value occurring
# 		after the statement finishes, not when it was received.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			<TIMESTAMP>2017-10-16T14:09:45 UTC</TIMESTAMP>
#
# The following elements are optional in <AUDIT_RECORD> elements. Many of them occur only with specific <NAME> element values.
#
# 		) <COMMAND_CLASS>
#
# 			A string that indicates the type of action performed.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<COMMAND_CLASS>drop_table</COMMAND_CLASS>
#
# 			The values correspond to the statement/sql/xxx commands counters, for example, xxx is drop_table and select
# 			for DROP_TABLE and SELECT statements, respectively.
#
# 			The following statement displays the possible names:
#
# 				SELECT REPLACE(EVENT_NAME, 'statement/sql/', '') AS name
# 				FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name
# 				WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'statement/sql/%' ORDER BY name;
#
# 		) <CONNECTION_ID>
#
# 			An unsigned integer representing the client connection identifier.
#
# 			This is the same as the value returned by the CONNECTION_ID() function within the session.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<CONNECTION_ID>127</CONNECTION_ID>
#
# 		) <CONNECTION_TYPE>
#
# 			The security state of the connection to the server.
#
# 			Permitted values are TCP/IP (TCP/IP connection established without encryption),
# 			SSL/TLS (TCP/IP connection established with encryption), Socket (Unix socket file connection),
# 			Named Pipe (Windows named pipe connection), and Shared Memory (Windows shared memory connection)
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<CONNECTION_TYPE>SSL/TLS</CONNECTION_TYPE>
#
# 		) <DB>
#
# 			A string representing the default database name.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<DB>test</DB>
#
# 		) <HOST>
#
# 			a string representing the client host name.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<HOST>localhost</HOST>
#
# 		) <IP>
#
# 			a string representing the client IP address.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<IP>127.0.0.1</IP>
#
# 		) <MYSQL_VERSION>
#
# 			A string representing the MySQL server version. This is the same as the value of the VERSION() function or
# 			version system variable.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<MYSQL_VERSION>5.7.21-log</MYSQL_VERSION>
#
# 		) <OS_LOGIN>
#
# 			A string representing the external user name used during the authentication process, as
# 			set by the plugin used to authenticate the client.
#
# 			With native (built-in) MySQL authentication, or if the plugin does not set the value, this element is empty.
#
# 			The value is the same as that of the external_user system variable.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<OS_LOGIN>jeffrey</OS_LOGIN>
#
# 		) <OS_VERSION>
#
# 			A string representing the operating system on which the server was built or is running.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<OS_VERSION>x86_64-Linux</OS_VERSION>
#
# 		) <PRIV_USER>
#
# 			A string representing the user that the server authenticated the client as.
#
# 			This is the user name that the server uses for privilege checking, and may differ from
# 			the <USER> value.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<PRIV_USER>jeffrey</PRIV_USER>
#
# 		) <PROXY_USER>
#
# 			A string representing the proxy user. This value is empty if user proxying is not in effect.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<PROXY_USER>developer</PROXY_USER>
#
# 		) <SERVER_ID>
#
# 			An unsigned integer representing the server ID.
# 			This is the same as the value of the server_id system variable.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<SERVER_ID>1</SERVER_ID>
#
# 		) <SQLTEXT>
#
# 			A string representing the text of an SQL statement.
#
# 			The value can be empty. Long values may be truncated.
#
# 			The string, like the audit log file itself, is written using UTF-8 (up to 4 bytes per character),
# 			so the value may be the result of conversion.
#
# 			For example, the original statement might have been received from the client as an SJIS string.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<SQLTEXT>DELETE FROM t1</SQLTEXT>
#
# 		) <STARTUP_OPTIONS>
#
# 			A string representing the options that were given on the command line or in option files when the MySQL
# 			server was started.
#
# 			The first option is the path to the server executable.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<STARTUP_OPTIONS>/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld
# 					--port=3306 --log_output=FILE</STARTUP_OPTIONS>
#
# 		) <STATUS>
#
# 			An unsigned integer representing the command status: 0 for success, nonzero if an error occurred.
#
# 			This is the same as the value of the mysql_errno() C API function.
#
# 			See the description for <STATUS_CODE> for information about how it differs from <STATUS>
#
# 			The audit log does not contain the SQLSTATE value or error message..
# 			To see the associations between error codes, SQLSTATE values and messages - see later.
#
# 			Warnings are not logged.
#
# 			Example: <STATUS>1051</STATUS>
#
# 		) <STATUS_CODE>
#
# 			An unsigned integer representing the command status: 0 for success, 1 if an error occurred.
#
# 			The STATUS_CODE value differs from the STATUS value: STATUS_CODE is 0 for success and 1 for error,
# 			which is compatible with the EZ_collector consumer for Audit Vault.
#
# 			STATUS is the value of the mysql_errno() C API function. This is 0 for success and nonzero for error,
# 			and thus is not necesarily 1 for error.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<STATUS_CODE>0</STATUS_CODE>
#
# 		) <USER>
#
# 			A string representing the user name sent by the client. This may differ from the <PRIV_USER> value.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<USER>root[root] @ localhost [127.0.0.1]</USER>
#
# 		) <VERSION>
#
# 			An unsigned integer representing the version of the audit log file format.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				<VERSION>1</VERSION>
#
# JSON Audit Log File Format
#
# For JSON-format audit logging (audit_log_format=JSON), the log file contents form a JSON array with each array
# element representing an audited event as a JSON hash of key/value pairs.
#
# Examples of complete event records appear later in this section.
#
# The following is an excerpt of partial events:
#
# [
# 		{
# 			"timestamp": "2018-01-15 13:50:01",
# 			"id": 0,
# 			"class": "audit",
# 			"event": "startup",
# 			---
# 		},
# 		{
# 			"timestamp": "2018-01-15 15:02:32",
# 			"id": 0,
# 			"class": "connection",
# 			"event": "connect",

# 			"id": 0,
# 			"class": "table_access",
# 			"event": "insert",
# 			---
# 		}
# 		---
# ]
#
# The audit log file is written using UTF-8 (up to 4 bytes per char).
# When the audit log plugin begins writing a new log file, it writes the opening [ array marker.
#
# When the plugin closes a log file, it writes the closing ] array marker. The closing marker is not
# present while the file is open.
#
# Items within audit records have these characteristics:
#
# 		) Some items appear in every audit record. Others are optional and may appear depending on the audit record type.
#
# 		) Order of items within an audit record is not guaranteed.
#
# 		) Item values are not fixed length. Long values may be truncated as indicated in the item descriptions given later.
#
# 		) The " and \ characters are encoded as \" and \\, respectively.
#
# The following example shows the JSON object formats for different event types (as indicated by the class and event items),
# reformatted slightly for readability.

# 										 "query": "INSERT INTO t1 (i) VALUES(1),(2),(3)",
# 										 "sql_command": "insert" } }
#
# The items in the following list appear at the top level of JSON-format audit records:
# Each item value is either a scalar or a JSON hash.
#
# For items that have a hash value, the description lists only the item names within that hash.
# For more complete descriptions of second-level hash items, see later in this section.
#
# ) account
#
# 		The MySQL account associated with the event.
#
# 		The value is a hash containing these items equivalent to the value of the CURRENT_USER() function

#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"account": { "user": "root", "host": "localhost" }
#
# ) class
#
# 		A string representing the event class.
# 		The class defines the type of event, when taken together with the event item that specifies the event subclass.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"class": "connection"
#
# 		The following table shows the permitted combinations of class and event values.
#
# 		TABLE 6.26 AUDIT LOG CLASS AND EVENT COMBINATIONS
#
# 		Class Value 				Permitted Event Values
# 		audit 						startup, shutdown
#
# 		connection 					connect, change_user, disconnect

# 		general 						status
#
# 		table_access_data 		read, delete, insert, update
#
# ) connection_data
#
# Information about a client connection.
#
# The value is a hash containing these items: connection_type, status,db.
# This item occurs only for audit records with a class value of connection.
#
# Example:
#
# 		"connection_data": { "connection_type": "ssl",
# 									"status": 0,
# 									"db": "test" }
#
# ) connection_id
#
# An unsigned integer representing the client connection identifier.
# This is the same as the value returned by the CONNECTION_ID() function within the session.
#
# Example:
#
# 		"connection_id": 5
#
# ) event:
#
# A string representing the subclass of the event class.
#
# The subclass defines the type of event, when taken together with the class item that specifies the event class.
# For more information, see the class item desc.
#
# Example:
#
# 		"event": "connect"
#
# ) general_data
#
# 	Information about an executed statement or command. The value is a hash containing these items:
# 	command, sql_command, query, status.
#
# This item occurs only for audit records with a class value of general.
#
# Example:
#
# 		"general_data": { "command": "Query",
# 								"sql_command": "show_variables",
# 								"query": "SHOW VARIABLES",
# 								"status": 0 }
#
# ) id
#
# 	An unsigned integer representing an event ID.
#
# Example:
#
# 		"id": 2
#
# For audit records that have the same timestamp value, their id values distinguish them and form a sequence.
# Within the audit log, timestamp/id pairs are unique.
#
# These pairs are bookmarks that identify event locations within the log.
#
# ) login
#
# Information indicating how a client connected to the server.
# The value is a hash containing these items: users, os, ip, proxy.
#
# Example:

#
# 		"shutdown_data": { "server_id": 1 }
#
# ) startup_data
#
# Information pertaining to audit log plugin initialization.
# The value is a hash containing these items: server_id, os_version, mysql_version, args.
#
# THis item occurs only for audit records with class and event values of audit and startup,
# respectively.
#
# Example:

# 								  "sql_command": "insert" }
#
# ) timestamp
#
# A string representing a UTC value in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format indicating the date and time when the audit
# event was generated.
#
# For example, the event corresponding to execution of an SQL statement received from a client has a timestamp

#
# Example:
#
# 		"timestamp": "2018-01-15 13:50:01"
#
# For audit records that have the same timestamp value, their id values distinguished them and form a sequence.
# Within the audit log, timestamp/id pairs are unique.
#
# These pairs are bookmarks that identify event locations within the log.
#
# These items appear within hash values associated with top-level items of JSON-format audit records:
#
# 	) args
#
# 		An array of options that were given on the command line or in option files when the MySQL server was started.
# 		The first option is the path to the server executable.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"args": ["/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld",
# 						"--loose-audit-log-format=JSON",
# 						"--log-error=log.err",
# 						"--pid-file=mysqld.pid",
# 						"--port=3306" ]
#
# 	) command
#
# 		A string representing the type of instruction that generated the audit event, such as a command that the server
# 		received from a client.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"command": "Query"
#
# 	) connection_type
#
# 		The security state of the connection to the server.
# 		Permitted values are tcp/ip (TCP/IP connection established without encryption),
# 		ssl(TCP/IP connection established with encryption),
# 		socket(Unix socket file connection),
# 		named_pipe(Windows named pipe connection),
# 		shared_memory(Windows shared memory connection)
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"connection_type": "tcp/tcp"
#
# ) db
#
# 		A string representing a database name.
# 		For connection_data, it is the default database.
#
# 		For table_access_data, it is the table database.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"db": "test"
#
# ) host
#
# 		A string representing the client host name.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"host": "localhost"
#
# ) ip
#
# 		A string representing the client IP address.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"ip": "::1"
#
# ) mysql_version
#
# 		A string representing the MySQL server version.
# 		This is the same as the value of the VERSION() function or version system variable.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"mysql_version": "5.7.21-log"
#
# ) os
#
# 		A string representing the external user name used during the authentication process, as set by the plugin used to authenticate
# 		the client.
#
# 		With native (built-in) MySQL authentication, or if the plugin does not set the value, this attribute is empty.
#
# 		The value is the same as that of the external_user system variable.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"os": "jeffrey"
#
# ) os_version
#
# 		A string representing the operating system on which the server was built or is running.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"os_version": "i686-Linux"
#
# ) proxy
#
# 		A string representing the proxy user. The value is empty if user proxying is not in effect.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"proxy": "developer"
#
# ) query
#
# 		A string representing the text of an SQL statement.
# 		The value can be empty.
#
# 		Long values may be truncated. The string, like the audit log file itself, is written using UTF-8
# 		(up to 4 bytes per character), so the value may be the result of conversion.
#
# 		For example, the original statement might have been received from the client as an SJIS string.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"query": "DELETE FROM t1"
#
# ) server_id
#
# 		An unsigned integer representing the server ID.
# 		THis is the same as the value of the server_id system variable.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"server_id": 1
#
# ) sql_command
#
# 		A string that indicates the SQL statement type.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"sql_command": "insert"
#
# 		The values correspond to the statement/sql/xxx command counters.
# 		For example, xxx is drop_table and select for DROP_TABLE and SELECT statements, respectively.
#
# 		The following statement displays the possible names:
#
# 			SELECT REPLACE(EVENT_NAME, 'statement/sql/', '') AS name
# 			FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name
# 			WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'statement/sql/%'
# 			ORDER BY name;
#
# ) status
#
# 		An unsigned integer representing the command status: 0 for success, nonzero if an error occurred.
# 		This is the same as the value of the mysql_errno() C API function.
#
# 		The audit log does not contain the SQLSTATE value or error message.
#
# 		To see the associations between error codes, SQLSTATE values and messages, see later.
#
# 		Warnings are not logged.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"status": 1051
#
# ) table
#
# 		A string representing a table name.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"table": "t1"
#
# ) user
#
# 		A string representing a user name. The meaning differs depending on the item within which user occurs:
#
# 			) Within account items, user is a string representing the user that the server authenticated the client as.
#
# 				This is the user name that the server uses for privilege checking.
#
# 			) Within login items, user is a string representing the user name sent by the client.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			"user": "root"
#
# AUDIT LOG LOGGING CONTROL
#
# This section describes how to control general characteristics of audit logging, such as the file to which
# the audit log plugin writes events, the format of written events and whether compression and encryption
# are enabled.
#
# For more info about user-defined functions and system variables that affect audit logging, see earlier.
#
# The audit log plugin can also control which audited events are written to the audit log file, based on
# teh account from which events originate or even content.
#
# More on this, later.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE NAME
#
# To control the audit log file name, set the audit_log_file system variable at server startup.
# By default, the name is audit.log in the server data directory.
#
# For security reasons, the audit log file should be written to a directory accessible only 
# to the MySQL server and to users with a legitimate reason to view the log.
#
# The plugin interprets the audit_log_file value as composed of a base name and an optional suffix.
#
# If compression or encryption are enabled, the effective file name (the name actually used to create the log file)
# differs from the configured file name because it has additional suffixes:
#
# 		) If compression is enabled, the plugin adds a suffix of .gz
#
# 		) If encryption is enabled, the plugin adds a suffix of .enc
#
# The effective audit log file name is the resulting name after adding possible compression
# and encryption suffixes to the configured file name. 	
#
# For example, if the configured audit_log_file is audit.log, the effective file name is one of these values:
#
# 		audit.log 			Not  compressed or encrypted
# 		audit.log.gz 		Compressed
#		audit.log.enc 		Encrypted
# 		audit.log.gz.enc 	Compressed and encrypted
#
# The audit log plugin performs certains actions at initialization and termination time based on the audit log file name:
#
# 		) During initialization, the plugin checks whether a file with the audit log file name already exists and renames it if so.
# 			(In this case, the plugin assumes that the previous server invocation exited unexpectedly with the audit log plugin running).
#
# 			The plugin then writes to a new empty audit log file.
#
# 		) At termination, the plugin renames the audit log file.
#
# 		) When renaming occurs (whether at plugin initialization or termination), the renamed file has a timestamp
# 			inserted after its base name and before its suffix.
#
# 			For example, if the file name is audit.log, the plugin renames it to a value such as audit.20180115T140633.log
# 			The timestamp is a UTC value in YYYYMMDDThhmmss format.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE FORMAT
#
# To control the audit log file format, set the audit_log_format system variable at server startup.
# By default, the form is NEW (new-style XML format).
#
# For details about each format, see earlier.
#
# If you change áudit_log_format, it is recommended that you also change audit_log_file.
# Otherwise, there will be two sets of log files with the same base name but different formats.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE COMPRESSION
#
# Audit log file compression can be enabled for any logging format.
#
# To control whether audit log file compression is enabled, set the audit_log_compression system variable at server startup.
# Permitted values are NONE (no compression; the default) and GZIP (GNU Zip compression).
#
# If both compression and encryption are enabled, compression occurs before encryption.
# To recover the original file manually, first decrypt it - then uncompress it.
#
# See more later.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE ENCRYPTION
#
# Audit log file encryption can be enabled for any logging format.
# Encryption is based on a user-defined password.
#
# To use this feature, the MySQL keyring must be enabled because audit logging uses it
# for password storage.
#
# Any keyring plugin can be used; see earlier.
#
# To control whether audit log file encryption is enabled, set the audit_log_encryption system variable
# at server startup.
#
# Permitted values are NONE (no encryption; the default) and AES (AES-256-CBC cipher encryption)
#
# To set or get the encryption password, use these user-defined functions (UDFs):
#
# 		) To set the encryption password, invoke audit_log_encryption_password_set(), which stores the password in the keyring,
# 			renames the current log file and begins a new log file encrypted with the new password.
#
# 			The renamed file has a timestamp inserted after its base name and before its suffix.
#
# 			For example, if the file name is audit.log.enc, the plugin renames it to a value such as audit.20180115T140633.log.enc
#
# 			The timestamp is a UTC value in YYYYMMDDThhmmss format.
#
# 			Previously written audit log files are not re-encrypted with the new password.
# 			Remember the previous password should you need to decrypt those files.
#
# 		) To get the current encryption password, invoke audit_log_encryption_password_get(), which retrieves the password from the keyring.
#
# For the first server startup after audit log encryption is enabled, the audit log plugin automatically generates
# the initial encryption password and stores it in the keyring.
#
# To discover this password, invoke audit_log_encryption_password_get()
#
# For additional information about audit log encryption functions, see earlier.
#
# If both compression and encryption are enabled, compression occurs before encryption.
# To recover the original file manually, first decrypt it, then uncompress it.
#
# See later for more info.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE MANUAL UNCOMPRESSION AND DECRYPTION
#
# Audit log files can be uncompressed and decrypted using standard tools.
#
# This should be done only for log files that have been closed and are no longer in use,
# not for the log file that the audit log plugin is currently writing.
#
# You can recognize closed log files because they will have been renamed by the audit log plugin
# to include a timestamp in the file name.
#
# For this discussion, assume that audit_log_file is set to audit.log
#
# IN that case, a closed audit log file has one of these names:
#
# 		audit.timestamp.log 			Not compressed or encrypted
# 		audit.timestamp.log.gz 		Compressed
# 		audit.timestamp.log.enc 	Encrypted
# 		audit.timestamp.log.gz.enc Compressed and encrypted
#
# To uncompress a compressed log file manually, use gunzip, gzip -d or equivalent commands.
#
# For example:
#
# 		gunzip -c audit.timestamp.log.gz > audit.timestamp.log
#
# To decrypt an encrypted log file manually, use the openssl command.
# For example:
#
# 	openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:password -md sha256 -in audit.timestamp.log.enc -out audit.timestamp.log
#
# If both compression and encryption are enabled for audit logging, compression occurs before encryption.
# In this case, the file name has .gz and .enc suffixes added, corresponding to the order in which those operations occur.
#
# To recover the original file manually, perform the operations in reverse.
# That is, first decrypt the file, then uncompress it:
#
# 		openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:password -md sha256 -in audit.timestamp.log.gz.enc -out audit.timestamp.log.gz 
# 		gunzip -c audit.timestamp.log.gz > audit.timestamp.log
#
# AUDIT LOGGING WRITE STRATEGY
#
# The audit log plugin can cause any of several strategies for log writes.
# Regardless of strategy, logging occurs on a best-effort basis, with no guarantee of consistency.
#
# To specify a write strategy, set the audit_log_strategy system variable at server startup.
#
# By default, the strategy value is ASYNCHRONOUS and the plugin logs asynchronously to a buffer,
# waiting if the buffer is full.		 		
#
# It is possible to tell the plugin not to wait (PERFORMANCE) or to log synchronously, either using
# file system caching (SEMISYNCHRONOUSLY) or forcing output with a sync() call after each write request (SYNCHRONOUS)
#
# For asynch write strategy, the audit_log_buffer_size system variable is teh buffer size in bytes.
# Set this variable at server startup to change the buffer size.
#
# The plugin uses a single buffer, which it allocates when it initializes and removes when it terminates.
# The plugin does not allocate this buffer for nonasynch write strategies.
#
# Asynch logging strategy has these characteristics:
#
# 		) Minimal impact on server performance and scalability
#
# 		) Blocking of threads that generate audit events for the shortest possible time; that is, time to allocate the buffer plus
# 			time to copy the event to the buffer.
#
# 		) Output goes to the buffer. A separate thread handles writes from the buffer to the log file.
#
# With asynch logging, the integrity of the log file may be compromised if a problem occurs during a write
# to the file or if the plugin does not shutdown cleanly (for example, in the event that the server host exits unexpectedly).
#
# To reduce this risk, set audit_log_strategy to use synch logging.
#
# A disadvantage of PERFORMANCE strategy is that it drops events when the buffer is full.
# For a heavily loaded server, the audit log may have events missing.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE SPACE MANAGEMENT AND NAME ROTATION
#
# The audit log file has the potentional to grow  very large and consume a lot of disk space.
#
# To enable management of the space used by its log files, the audit log plugin provides
# the audit_log_rotate_on_size and audit_log_flush system variables, which control audit log file
# rotation and flushing.
#
# Rotation can be done manually or automatically based on file size.
#
# MANUAL AUDIT LOG FILE ROTATION.
#
# By default, audit_log_rotate_on_size=0 and there is no log rotation except that which you perform manually.
#
# IN this case, the audit log plugin closes and reopens the log file when the audit_log_flush value changes from disabled
# to enabled.
#
# Log file renaming must be done externally to the server. 
#
# Suppose that the log file name is audit.log and you want to maintain the three most recent log files,
# cycling through the names audit.log.1.xml through audit.log.3.xml.
#
# On Unix, perform rotation manually like this:
#
# 1. From the cmd line, rename the current log files:
#
# 			mv audit.log.2.xml audit.log.3.xml
# 			mx audit.log.1.xml audit.log.2.xml
# 			mv audit.log audit.log.1.xml
#
# At this point, the plugin is still writing to the current log file, which has been renamed to audit.log.1.xml
#
# 2. Connect to the server and flush the log file so the plugin closes it and reopens a new audit.log file:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL audit_log_flush = ON;
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		FOr JSON-format logging, renaming audit log files manually makes them unavailable to the log-reading functions
# 		because the audit log plugin no longer can determine that they are part of the log file sequence.
#
# 		Consider setting audit_log_rotate_on_size greater than 0 to use size-based rotation instead.
#
# AUTOMATIC SIZE-BASED AUDIT LOG FILE ROTATION.
#
# If audit_log_rotate_on_size is greater than 0, setting audit_log_flush has no effect.
#
# Instead, whenever a write to the log file causes its size to exceed the audit_log_rotate_on_size value,
# the audit log plugin closes the file, renames it and opens a new log file.
#
# When the plugin renames the original file, the renamed file has a timestamp inserted after its base name
# and before its suffix.
#
# For example, if the file name is audit.log, the plugin renames it to a value such as audit.20180115T140633.log
#
# The timestamp is a UTC value in YYYYMMDDThhmmss format.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		With size-based log file rotation, renamed log files do not rotate off the end of the name sequence.
#
# 		Instead, they have unique names and accumulate indefinitly.
# 		To avoid excessive space use, remove old files periodically, backing them up first as necessary.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILE READING
#
# The audit log plugin enables bookmarking and reading of JSON-format audit log files.
# (These capabilities do not apply to files written in other log formats).
#
# When the audit log plugin initializes and is configured for JSON logging, it uses the directory
# containing the audit log file (determined from the audit_log_file value), as the location to search
# for readable audit log files.
#
# To do this, it uses the value of audit_log_file to determine the file base name and suffix values,
# then looks for files with names that match the following pattern, where [...] indicates optional file name parts:
#
# 		basename[.timestamp].suffix[.gz][.enc]
#
# The plugin opens each matching file, checks that it really contains JSON audit records, and sorts them using
# the timestamps from the first record of each file to construct a list of log files that are subject to use with the log-reading functions.
#
# The plugin cannot include in the sequence files that were renamed manually and do not match the preceding pattern,
# or that were encrypted with a password different from the current password.
#
# To read events from the audit log, use these user-defined functions (UDFs):
#
# 		) audit_log_read_bookmark() returns a JSON string representing a bookmark for the most recently written audit log event.
#
# 			This bookmark is suitable for passing to audit_log_read() to indicate to that function where to begin reading.
#
# 			Example bookmark:
#
# 			{ "timestamp": "2018-01-15 21:03:44", "id": 0 }
#
# 		) audit_log_read() reads events from the audit log and returns a JSON string containing an array of audit events.
#
# Example audit_log_read() invocation using the current bookmark:
#
# 		SELECT audit_log_read(audit_log_read_bookmark());
# 		+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| audit_log_read(audit_log_read_bookmark()) 		 									 |
#   	+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| [ {"timestamp":"2018-01-15 22:41:24", "id":0, "class":"connection", ... 	 |
# 		+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# Each event in the audit_log_read() return value is a JSON hash, except that the last array element may be a JSON null value
# to indicate no following events are available to read.
#
# For example:
#
# [
# 		{ "timestamp": "2018-01-15 22:08:08", "id": 10,
# 		  "class": "general", "event": "status",
# 		  ---
# 		},
# 		{
# 		  "timestamp": "2018-01-15 22:08:08", "id": 11,
# 		  "class": "connection", "event": "disconnect",
# 			---
# 		},
# 		{
# 			"timestamp": "2018-01-15 13:39:33", "id": 0,
# 			"class": "connection", "event": "connect",
# 			---
# 		},
# 		{
# 			"timestamp": "2018-01-15 13:39:33", "id": 1,
# 			"class": "general", "event": "status",
# 			---
# 		},
# 		{
# 			"timestamp": "2018-01-15 13:39:33", "id": 2,
# 			"class", "connection", "event": "disconnect",
# 			---
# 		},
# 		null
# ]
#
# Use audit_log_read() like this:
#
# ) For the first call to audit_log_read() within a session, pass a bookmark indicating where to begin reading.
#
# ) If the final value of the returned array is not a JSON null value, there are more events following those just read
# 		and audit_log_read() can be called without or with a bookmark argument.
#
# 		Without an argument, reading continues with the next unread event.
# 		With a bookmark argument, reading continues from the bookmark.
#
# ) If the final value of the returned array is a JSON null value, there are no more events left to be read and the next call
# 		to audit_log_read() must include a bookmark argument.
#
# A bookmark is a JSON hash that indicates where and how much to read. The following items are significant in the bookmark value
# (other items are ignored):
#
# 	) timestamp, id: The location within the audit log of the first event to read.
# 							Both items must be present to completely specify a position.
#
# 	) max_array_length: The maximum number of events to read from the log.
# 	
# 								If omitted, the default is to read to teh end of the log or until the 
# 								read buffer is full, whichever comes first.
#
# The result returned from either log-reading function is a binary string.
#
# To use the string with functions that require a nonbinary string (such as the functions that manipulate JSON values),
# convert it to utf8mb4.
#
# Suppose that a bookmark has this value:
#
# SELECT @mark := audit_log_read_bookmark() AS mark;
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | mark 											 			 |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
# | { "timestamp": "2018-01-15 16:10.28", "id": 2 } |
# +-------------------------------------------------+
#
# Calling audit_log_read() with that bookmark can return multiple events.
#
# To set a limit on the number of events read by audit_log_read(), convert the bookmark
# to utf8mb4 then add to it a max_array_length item with a value of 1.
#
# For example, using the preceding bookmark, convert and modify it as follows:
#
# 		SET @mark = CONVERT(@mark USING utf8mb4);
# 		SET @mark := JSON_SET(@mark, '$.max_array_length', 1);
# 		SELECT @mark;
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| @mark 																						  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| {"id": 2, "timestamp", "2018-01-15 16:10:28", "max_array_length": 1 	  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# The modified bookmark, when passed to audit_log_read() - produces a result of a single audit record.
#
# To set a limit on the number of bytes that audit_log_read() reads, set the audit_log_read_buffer_size system variable.
# As of MySQL 8.0.12, this variable has a default of 32kb and can be set at runtime.
#
# Each client should set its session value of audit_log_read_buffer_size appropriately for its use of audit_log_read().
# Prior to MySQL 8.0.12, audit_log_read_buffer_size has a default of 1 MB, affects all clients, and can be changed
# only at server startup.
#
# Each call to audit.log_read() returns as many available items as fit within the buffer size,
# skipping items that do not fit within the buffer size.
#
# Given this behavior, consider these factors when assessing the proper buffer size for an application:
#
# ) There is a tradeoff between number of calls to audit_log_read() and items returned per call:
#
# 	With a smaller buffer size, calls return fewer times - so more calls are needed.
#
# With a large buffer - calls return more items, so fewer calls are needed.
#
# ) With a smaller buffer size, such as the default size of 32kb, there is a greater chance that
# items will exceed the buffer size and audit_log_read() will skip them.
#
# Skipped items generate warnings.
#
# For additional information about audit log-reading functions, see later.
#
# AUDIT LOG FILTERING
#
# Note:
#
# 		This section describes how audit log filtering works as of if the audit log plugin and the accompanying audit 
# 		tables and UDFs are installed.
#
# 		If the plugin is installed, but not the accompanying audit tables and UDFs, the plugin operates in legacy
# 		filtering mode.
#
# 		Legacy mode is filtering behavior as it was prior to MySQL 5.7.13. I.e, before rule-based filtering.
#
# In legacy filtering mode - the audit log plugin had the capability of controlling logging of audited events
# by filtering them based on the account from which events originate or event status.
#
# Current filtering capabilities are extended:
#
# 		) Audited events can be filtered using these characteristics:
#
# 			) USer account
#
# 			) Audit event class
#
# 			) Audit event subclass
#
# 			) Value of event fields such as those that indicate operation status or SQL statement executed
#
# 		) Audit filtering is rule based:
#
# 			) A filtering definition creates a set of auditing rules.
#
# 				Definitions can be configured to include or exclude events for logging based on
# 				the characeristics just described.
#
# 			) Filter rules have the capability of blocking (aborting) execution of qualifying events,
# 				in addition to existing capabilities for event logging.
#
# 			) Multiple filters can be defined, and any given filter can be assigned to any number of user accounts.
#
# 			) It is possible to define a default filter to use with any user account that has no explicitly assigned filter.
#
# 		) Audit filters can be defined, displayed and modified using an SQL interface based on user-defined functions (UDFs)
#
# 		) Audit filter definitions are stored in the tables in the mysql system database.
#
# 		) Within a given session, the value of the read-only audit_log_filter_id system variable indicates whether a filter
# 			has been assigned to the session.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				By default, rule-based audit log filtering logs no auditable events for any users.
#
# 				To log all auditable events for all users, use the following statements, 
# 				which create a simple filter to enable logging and assign it to the default account:
#
# 					SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_all', '{ "filter": { "log": true } }');
# 					SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('%', 'log_all');
#
# 				The filter assigned to % is used for connections from any account that has no explicitly assigned filter
# 				(which initially is true for all accounts)
#
# The following list briefly summarizes the UDFs that implement the SQL interface for audit filtering control:
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_set_filter(): Define a filter
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_remove_filter(): Remove a filter
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_set_user(): Start filtering a user account
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_remove_user(): Stop filtering a user account
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_flush(): Flush manual changes to the filter tables to affect ongoing filtering.
#
# For usage examples and complete details about the filtering functions, see later.
#
# Audit log filtering functions are subject to these constraints:
#
# 		) To use any filtering function, the audit_log plugin must be enabled.
#
# 			Otherwise, an error occurs:
#
# 			SELECT audit_log_filter_flush();
# 			+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| audit_log_filter_flush() 															    |

#
# USING AUDIT LOG FILTERING FUNCTIONS
#
# Before using the audit log user-defined functions (UDFs), install them according to earlier.
# The SUPER privilege is required to use any of these functions.
#
# The audit log filtering functions enable filtering control by providing an interface to create,
# modify and remove filter definitions and assign filters to user accounts.
#
# Filter definitions are JSON values. For information about using JSON data in MySQL, see later.
#
# This section shows some simple filter definitions. For more info about filter definitions, see earlier.
#
# When a connection arrives, the audit log plugin determines which filter to use for the new session by
# searching for the user account name in the current filter assignments:
#
# 		) If a filter is assigned to the user, the audit log uses that filter.
#
# 		) Otherwise, if no user-specific filter assignment exists, but there is a filter assigned to the 
# 			default account (%), the audit log uses the default filter.
#
# 		) Otherwise, the audit log selects no audit events from the session for processing.
#
# If a change-user operation occurs during a session (see later), filter assignment for the
# session is updated using the same rules but for the new user.
#
# By default, no accounts have a filter assigned, so no processing of auditable events occurs for any account.
#
# Suppose that instead you want the default ot be to log only connection-related activity
#
# (for example, to see connect, change-user and disconnect events - but not the SQL statements
# users execute while connected).
#
# TO achieve this, define a filter (shown here named log_conn_events) that enables logging only
# of events in the connection class, and assign that filter to the default account,
# represented by the % account name:
#
# 		SET @f = '{ "filter": { "class": { "name": "connection" } } }';
# 		SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_conn_events', @f);
# 		SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('%', 'log_conn_events');
#
# Now the audit log uses this default account filter for connections from any account that
# has no explicitly defined filter.
#
# To assign a filter explicitly to a particular user account or accounts, define the filter, then assign
# it to the relevant accounts:
#
# 		SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_all', '{ "filter": { "log": true } }');
# 		SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('user1@localhost', 'log_all');
# 		SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('user2@localhost', 'log_all');
#
# Now full logging is enabled for user1@localhost and user2localhost.
#
# COnnections from other accounts continue to be filtered using the default account filter.
#
# To disassociate a user account from its current filter, either unassign the filter or assign a different filter:
#
# 		) Unassign the filter from the user account:
#
# 			SELECT audit_log_filter_remove_user('user1@localhost');
#
# 			Filtering of current sessions for the account remains unaffected.
# 			Subsequent connections from the account are filtered using the default account filter
# 			if there is one, and are not logged otherwise.
#
# 		) Assign a different filter to the user account:
#
# 			SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_nothing', '{ "filter": { "log": false } }');
# 			SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('user1@localhost', 'log_nothing');
#
# 		Filtering of current sessions for the account remains unaffected.
#
# 		Subsequent connections from the account are filtered using the new filter.
# 		For the filter shown here, that means no logging for new connections from user1@localhost.
#
# For audit log filtering, user name and host name comparisons are case-sensitive.
#
# This differs from comparisons for privilege checking, for which host name comparisons
# are not case-sensitive.
#
# To remove a filter, do this:
#
# 		SELECT audit_log_filter_remove_filter('log_nothing');
#
# Removing a filter also unassigns it from any user to whom it has been assigned, including any current sessions for those users.
#
# The filtering UDFs just described affect filtering immediately and update the audit log tables
# in the mysql system database that store filters and user accounts.
#
# It is also possible to modify the audit log tables directly using statements such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.
# But such changes do not affect filtering immediately.
#
# To flush your changes and make them operational, call audit_log_filter_flush():
#
# 		SELECT audit_log_filter_flush();
#
# To determine whether a filter has been assigned to the current session, check the session value
# of the read-only audit_log_filter_id system variable.
#
# If the value is 0, no filter is assigned:
# A nonzero value indicates the internally maintained ID of the assigned filter:
#
# 		SELECT @@audit_log_filter_id;
# 		+-------------------------------------------+
# 		| @@audit_log_filter_id 						  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------+
# 		| 						2 								  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------+
#
# WRITING AUDIT LOG FILTER DEFINITIONS
#
# Filter definitions are JSON values.
# For information about using JSON data in MySQL, see later.
#
# Filter definitions have this form, where actions indicates how filtering takes place:
#
# 		{ "filter": actions }
#
# LOGGING ALL EVENTS
#
# To explicitly enable or disable logging of all events, use a log element in the filter:
#
# 		{
# 			"filter": 	{ "log": true }
# 		}
#
# The log value can be either true or false.
#
# The preceding filter enables logging of all events. It is equivalent to:
#
# 		{
# 			"filter": { }
# 		}
#
# Logging behavior depends on the log value and whether class or event items are specified:
#
# 		) With log specified, its given value is used.
#
# 		) Without log specified, logging is true if no class or event item is specified, and false otherwise
# 			(in which case, class or event can include their own log item)
#
# LOGGING SPECIFIC EVENT CLASSES
#
# To log events of a specific class, use a class element in the filter, with its name field denoting the name of the class to log:
#
# 		{
# 			"filter": {
# 				"class": { "name": "connection" }
# 			}
# 		}
#
# The name value can be connection, general or table_access to log connection, general or table-access events, respectively.
#
# The preceding filter enables logging of events in teh connection class.
# IT is equivalent to the following filter with log items made explicit:
#
# 		{
# 			"filter": {
# 				"log": false,
# 				"class":. { "log": true,
# 								"name": "connection" }
# 			}
# 		}
#
# To enable logging of multiple classes, define the class value as a JSON array element that names the classes:
#
# 		{
# 			"filter": {
# 				"class": [
# 					{ "name": "connection" },
# 					{ "name": "general" },
# 					{ "name": "table_access" }
# 				]
# 			}
# 		}
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		When multiple instances of a given item appear at the same level within a filter definition,
# 		the item values can be combined into a single instance of that item within an array value.
#
# 		The preceding definition can be written like this:
#
# 			{
# 				"filter": {
# 					"class": [
# 						{ "name": [ "connection", "general", "table_access" ] }
# 					]
# 				]
# 			}
# 			
#
#
# LOGGING SPECIFIC EVENT SUBCLASSES
#
# To select specific event subclasses, use an event item containing a name item that names the subclasses.
# The default action for events selected by an event item is to log them.
#
# For example, this filter enables logging for the named event subclasses:
#
# 		{
# 			"filter": {
# 				"class": [
# 					{
# 						"name": "connection",
# 						"event": [
# 							{ "name": "connect" },
# 							{ "name": "disconnect" }
# 						]
# 					},
# 					{ "name": "general" },
# 					{
# 						"name": "table_access",
# 						"event": [
# 							{ "name": "insert" },
# 							{ "name": "delete" },
# 							{ "name": "update" }
# 					]
# 				}
# 			]
# 		}
# }	
#
# The event item can also contain explicit log items to indicate whether to log qualifying events.
# This event item selects multiple events and explicitly indicates logging behavior for them:
#
# 		"event": [
# 			{ "name": "read", "log": false },
# 			{ "name": "insert", "log": true },
# 			{ "name": "delete", "log": true },
# 			{ "name": "update", "log": true }
# 		]
#
# The event item can also indicate whether to block qualifying events, if it contains an abort item.
# For details, see later.
#
# EVENT CLASS AND SUBCLASS COMBINATIONS
#
# Event Class 			Event Subclass 				Desc
# connection 			connect 							Connection initiation (successful or unsuccessful)
# connection 			change_user 					Uses re-authentication with different user/pw during session
# connection 			disconnect 						Connection termination
#
# general 				status 							general operation information
#
# table_access 		read 								Table read statements, such as SELECT or INSERT_INTO_..._SELECT
# table_access 		delete 							Table delete statements, such as DELETE or TRUNCATE_TABLE
# table_access 		insert 							Table insert statements, such as INSERT or REPLACE
# table_access 		update 							Table update statements, such as UPDATE
#
# LOG AND ABORT CHARACTERISTICS PER EVENT CLASS AND SUBCLASS COMBINATION
#
# Event Class 			Event Subclass 	Can be logged Can be Aborted
# connection 			connect 							Yes/No
# connection 			change_user 					Yes/No
# connection 			disconnect 						Yes/No
#
# general 				status 							Yes/No
# table_access 		read 								Yes/Yes
# table_access 		delete 							Yes/Yes
# table_access 		insert 							Yes/Yes
# table_access 		update 							Yes/Yes
#
# INCLUSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE LOGGING
#
# A filter can be defined in inclusive or exclusive mode:
#
# 		) Inclusive mode logs only explicitly specified items.
#
# 		) Exclusive mode logs everything but explicitly specified items.
#
# To perform inclusive logging, disable logging globally and enable logging for specific classes.
#
# This filter logs connect and disconnect events in the connection class,
# and events in the general class:
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"log": false,
# 			"class": [
# 				{
# 					"name": "connection"
# 					"event": [
# 						{ "name": "connect", "log": true },
# 						{ "name": "disconnect", "log": true }
# 					]
# 				},
# 				{ "name": "general", "log": true }
# 			]
# 		}
# 	}
#
# To perform exclusive logging, enable logging globally and disable logging for specific classes.
# This filter logs everything except events in the general class:
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"log": true,
# 			"class":
# 				{ "name": "general", "log": false }
# 		}
# }
#
# The filter logs change_user events in teh connection class, and table_access events:
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"log": true,
# 			"class": [
# 				{
# 					"name": "connection",
# 					"event": [
# 						{ "name": "connect", "log": false },
# 						{ "name": "disconnect", "log": false }
# 					]
# 				},
# 				{ "name": "general", "log": false }
# 			]
# 		}
# }
#
# TESTING EVENT FIELD VALUES
#
# To enable logging based on specific event field values, specify a field item within the log item taht indicates
# the field name and its expected value:
#
# {
# 		"filer": {
# 			"class": {
# 			"name": "general",
# 				"event": {
# 					"name": "status",
# 					"log": {
# 						"field": { "name": "general_command.str", "value": "Query" }
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
# Each event contains event class-specific fields that can be accessed from within a filter to perform custom filtering.
#
# A connection event indicates when a connection-related activity occurs during a session, such as a user connecting or disconnecting from
# the server.
#
# The following table indicates the permitted fields for connection events.

# 		) read event:
#
# 			) SELECT
#
# 			) INSERT_..._SELECT (for tables referenced in SELECT clause)
#
# 			) REPLACE_...._SELECT (for tables referenced in SELECT clause)
#
# 			) UPDATE_..._WHERE (for tables referenced in WHERE clause)
#
# 			) HANDLER_..._READ

#
# 			) LOAD XML INFILE
#
# 		) update event:
#
# 			) UPDATE
#
# 			) UPDATE_..._WHERE (for tables referenced in UPDATE clause)
#
# BLOCKING EXECUTION OF SPECIFIC EVENTS
#
# Event items can include an abort item that indicates whether to prevent qualifying events from executing.
# For example, abort enables rules to be written that block execution of specific SQL statements.
#
# The abort item must appear within an event item. For example:
#
# "event": {
# 		"name": qualifying event subclass names
# 		"abort": condition
# 	}
#
# For event subclasses selected by the name item, the abort function is true or false, depending on condition evaluation.
#
# If the condition evaluates to true, the event is blocked.
# Otherwise, the event continues executing.
#
# The condition specification can be as simple as true or false, or it can be more complex such that evaluation
# depends on event characteristics.
#
# This filter blocks INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements:
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"class": {
# 				"name": "table_access",
# 				"event": {
# 					"name": [ "insert", "update", "delete" ],
# 					"abort": true
#				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
# Á more complex filter, with a subsectioning of blocking the same things, but only for a specific table (finances.bank_account):
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"class": {
# 				"name": "table_access",
# 				"event": {
# 					"name": [ "insert", "update", "delete" ],
# 					"abort": {
# 						"and": [
# 							{ "field": { "name": "table_database.str", "value": "finances" } },
# 							{ "field": { "name": "table_name.str", "value": "bank_account } }
# 						]
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
# Statements matched and blocked by the filter return an error to the client:
#
# 	ERROR 1045 (28000): Statemnt was aborted by an audit log filter
#
# Not all events can be blocked.
# For an event that cannot, the audit log writes a warning to the error log rather than blocking it.
#
# For attempts to define a filter in which the abort item appears elsewhere than in an event item, an error occurs.
#
# LOGICAL OPERATORS
#
# Logical operators (and, or, not) can be used in log items. This permits construction of more advanced filtering configurations:
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"class": {
# 				"name": "general",
# 				"event": {
# 					"name": "status",
# 					"log": {
# 						"or": [
# 							{
# 								"and": [
# 									{ "field": { "name": "general_command.str", "value": "Query" }},
# 									{ "field": { "name": "general_command.length", "value": 5 }}
# 								]
# 							},
# 							{
# 								"and": [
# 									{ "field": { "name": "general_command.str", "value": "Execute" }},
#Q 								{ "field": { "name": "general_command.length", "value": 7 }}
# 								]
# 							}
# 						]
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
#
# REFERENCING PREDEFINED VARIABLES
#
# To refer to a predefined variable in a log condition, use a variable item, which tests equality against a given value:
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"class": {
# 				"name": "general",
# 				"event": {
# 					"name": "status",
# 					"log": {
# 						"variable": {
# 							"name": "audit_log_connection_policy_value", "value": "::none"
# 						}
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
# Each predefined variable correspond to a system variable.
#
# By writing a filter that tests a predefined variable, you can modify filter operation by setting the
# corresponding system variable, without having to redefine the filter.
#
# For examplke, by writing a flter that tests the value of the audit_log_connection_policy_value predefined
# variable, you can modify filter operation by changing the value of the audit_log_connection_policy system varible.
#
# The audit_log_xxx_policy system variable are used for legacy mode audit log.
#
# With rule-based audit log filtering, those variables remain visible (for example, using SHOW_VARIABLES), but changes
# to them have no effect unless you write filters containing constructs that refer to them.
#
# The following list describes the permitted predefined variables for variable items:
#
# 		) audit_log_connection_policy_value
#
# 			This variable corresponds to the value of the audit_log_connection_policy system variable.
# 			The value is an unsigned integer.
#
# 			The following showcases the permitted values and the corresponding audit_log_connection_policy values.
#
# 			Audit_log_connection_policy_value Values
#
# 			Value 				CORRESPONDING audit_log_connection_policy Value
#
# 			0 or "::none" 		NONE
#
# 			1 or "::errors"  	ERRORS
#
# 			2 or "::all" 		ALL
#
# 			The "::xxx" values are symbolic pseudo-constants that may be given instead of the literal numeric values.
# 			They must be quoted as string and are case-sensitive.
#
# 		) audit_log_policy_value
#
# 			This variable corresponds to the value of the audit_log_policy system variable.
#
# 			This value is an unsigned integer.
#
# 			The following table shows the permitted values and the corresponding audit_log_policy values.
#
# 			AUDIT_LOG_POLICY_VALUE VALUES
#
# 			Value 				Corresponding audit_log_policy Value
#
# 			0 or "::none" 		NONE
#
# 			1 or "::logins" 	LOGINS
#
#  		2 or "::all" 		ALL
#
# 			3 or "::queries" 	QUERIES
#
# 			The "::xxx" values are symbolic pseudo-constants that may be given instead of the literal numeric values.
# 			They must be quoted as strings and are case-sensitive.
#
# 		) audit_log_statement_policy_value
#
# 			This variable corresponds to the value of the audit_log_statement_policy system varialbe.
# 			The value is an unsigned integer.
#
# 			The following table shows the perrmited values and the corresponding audit_log_statement_policy values.
#
# 			AUDIT_LOG_STATEMENT_POLICY_VALUE values
#
# 			Value 				Corresponding audit_log_statement_policy Value
#
# 			0 or "::none" 		NONE
#
# 			1 or "::errors" 	ERRORS
#
# 			2 or "::all" 		ALL
#
# 			The "::xxx" values are symbolic pseudo-constants that may be given instead of the literal numeric values.
# 			They must be quoted as strings and are case-sensitive.
#
# REFERENCING PREDEFINED FUNCTIONS
#
# To refer to a predefined function in a log condition, use a function item, which takes
# names and args values to specify the function name and its arguments, respectively:
#
# 	{
# 	  "filter": {
# 			"class": {
# 				"name": "general",
# 				"event": {
# 					"name": "status",
# 					"log": {
# 						"function": {
# 							"name": "find_in_include_list",
# 							"args": [ { "string": [ { "field": "user.str" },
# 															{ "string": "@"},
# 															{ "field": "host.str" } ] } ]
# 						}
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
# The function as specified in the name item should be the function name only, without paranthesis
# or the argument list.
#
# Arguments in the args item, if there is one, must be given in the order listed in the function desc.
# Arguments can refer to predefined variables, event fields, or string or numeric constants.
#
# The preceding filter determines whether to log general class status events depending on whether the
# current user is found in the audit_log_include_accounts system variable.
#
# That user is constructed using fields in the event.
#
# The following list describes the permitted predefined functions for function items:
#
# 		) audit_log_exclude_accounts_is_null()
#
# 			Checks whether the audit_log_exclude_accounts system variable is NULL.
# 			This function can be helpful when defining filters that correspond to the legacy audit log implementation.
#
# 			arguments: None
#
# 		) audit_log_include_accounts_is_null()
#
# 			Checks whether the audit_log_include_accounts system variable is NULL.
# 			This function can be helpful when defining filters that correspond to the legacy audit log implementation.
#
# 			Argument: None
#
# 		) debug_sleep(millisec)
#
# 			Sleeps for a given number of milliseconds. This function is used during performance measurement.
# 			
# 			debug_sleep() is available for debug builds only.
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				) millisec: an unsigned integer that specifies the number of milliseconds to sleep.
#
# 		) find_in_exclude_list(account)
#
# 			Checks whether an account string exists in the audit log exclude list
# 			(the value of the audit_log_exclude_accounts system variable)
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				) account: A string that specifies the user account name.
#
# 		) find_in_include_list(account)
#
# 			Checks whether an account string exists in the audit log include list
# 			(the value of the audit_log_include_accounts system variable)
#
# 			Argument:
#
# 				) account: A string that specifies the user account name.
#
# 		) string_find(text, substr)
#
# 			Checks whether the substr value is contained in the text value.
# 			This search is case-sensitive.
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				) text: The text string to search.
#
# 				) substr: The substring to search for in text.
#
# REPLACING A USER FILTER
#
# In some cases, the filter definition can be changed dynamically.
# To do this, define a filter configuration within an existing filter.
#
# For example:
#
# {
# 		"filter": {
# 			"id": "main",
# 			"class": {
# 				"name": "table_access",
# 				"event": {
# 					"name": [ "update", "delete" ],
# 					"log": false,
# 					"filter": {
# 						"class": {
# 							"name": "general",
# 							"event": { "name": "status",
# 										  "filter": { "ref": "main" } }
# 					},
# 					"activate": {
# 						"or": [
# 							{ "field": { "name": "table_name.str", "value": "temp_1" } },
# 							{ "field": { "name": "table_name.str", "value": "temp_2" } }
# 						]
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
# }
#
# A new filter is activated when the activate element within a subfilter evalutes to true.
# Using activate in a top-level filter is not permitted.
#
# A new filter can be replaced with the original one by using a ref item inside the subfilter
# to refer to the original filter id.
#
# The filter shown operates like this:
#
# 		) The main filter waits for table_access events, either update or delete.
#
# 		) If the update or delete table_access event occurs on the temp_1 or temp_2 table, the filter
# 			is replaced with the internal one (without an id, since there is no need to refer to it explicitly)
#
# 		) If the end of command is signalled (general/status event), an entry is written to the audit log file and
# 			the filter is replaced with the main filter.
#
# The filter is useful to log statements that update or delete anything from the temp_1 or temp_2 tables, such
# 	as this one:
#
# 		UPDATE temp_1, temp_3 SET temp_1.a=21, temp_3.a=23;
#
# The statement generates multiple table_access events, but the audit log file will contain only
# general/status entries.
#
# Note:
#
# 		Any id values used in the definition are evaluted with respect only to that definition.
# 		They have nothing to do with the value of the audit_log_filter_id system variable.
#
# LEGACY MODE AUDIT LOG FILTERING
#
# Note:
# 		THis section describes legacy audit log filtering, which applies if the audit_log plugin is installed
# 		but not the accompanying audit tables and UDFs needed for rule-based filtering.
#
# The audit log plugin can filter audited events.
#
# This enables you to control whether audited events are written to the audit log file based on the account
# from which events originate or event status.
#
# Status filtering occurs separately for connection events and statement events.
#
# EVENT FILTERING BY ACCOUNT
#
# To filter audited events based on the originating account, set one of these system variables at server startup or runtime:
#
# 		) audit_log_include_accounts: The accounts to include in audit logging. If this variable is set, only these accounts are audited.
#
# 		) audit_log_exclude_accounts: The accounts to exclude from audit logging. If this variable is set, all but these accounts are audited.
#
# The value for either variable can be NULL or a string containing one or more comma-separated account names, each in user_name@host_name format.
#
# By default, both variables are NULL, in which case, no account filtering is done and auditing occurs for all accounts.
#
# Modifications to audit_log_include_accounts or audit_log_exclude_accounts affect only connections created subsequent
# to the modification, not existing connections.
#
# Example: To enable audit logging only for the user1 and user2 local host accounts, set the audit_log_include_accounts system
# variable like this:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = 'user1@localhost, user2@localhost';
#
# Only one of audit_log_include_accounts or audit_log_exclude_accounts can be non-NULL at a time:
#
# 		) If you set audit_log_include_accounts, the server sets audit_log_exclude_accounts to NULL.
#
# 		) If you attempt to set audit_log_exclude_accounts, an error occurs unless audit_log_include_accounts is NULL.
# 			In this case, you must first clear audit_log_include_accounts by setting it to NULL.
#
# 		-- This sets audit_log_exclude_accounts to NULL
# 		SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = value;
#
# 		-- This fails because audit_log_include_accounts is not NULL
# 		SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = value;
#
# 		-- To set audit_log_exclude_accounts, first set
# 		-- audit_log_include_accounts to NULL
# 		SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = NULL;
# 		SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = value;
#
# If you inspect the value of either variable, be aware that SHOW_VARIABLES display NULL as an empty string.
# To avoid this, use SELECT instead:
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'audit_log_include_accounts';
# 		+-----------------------------------------------+
# 		| Variable_name 					| Value 				|
# 		+-----------------------------------------------+
# 		| audit_log_include_accounts 	| 					   |
# 		+-----------------------------------------------+
#
# 		SELECT @@audit_log_include_accounts;
# 		+--------------------------------------------+
# 		| @@audit_log_include_accounts 					|
# 		+--------------------------------------------+
# 		| NULL 													|
# 		+--------------------------------------------+
#
# If a user name or host name requires quoting because it contains a comma, space or other special character, quote it using
# single quotes.
#
# If the variable value itself is quoted with single quotes, double each inner single quote or escape it with a backlash.
#
# The following statements each enable audit logging for the local root account and are equivalent,
# even though the quoting styles differ:
#
# SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = 'root@localhost';
# SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = ''root''@''localhost'';
# SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = '\'root\'@\'localhost\'';
# SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = "'root'@'localhost'";
#
# The last statement will nto work if the ANSI_QUOTES sql mode is enabled, because in that mode, double quotes signifiy
# identifier quoting, not string quoting.
#
# EVENT FILTERING BY STATUS
#
# To filter audited events based on status, set the following system variables at server startup or runtime.
# These variables apply only for legacy audit log filtering.
#
# For JSON audit log filteirng, differnet status variables apply.
#
# ) audit_log_connection_policy: Logging policy for connection events
#
# ) audit_log_statement_policy: Logging policy for statement events
#
# Each variable takes a value of ALL (log all associated events, this is the default), ERRORS (lgo only failed events), or NONE (do not log events).
# For example, to log all statement events but only failed connection events, use these settings:
#
# SET GLOBAL audit_log_statement_policy = ALL;
# SET GLOBAL audit_log_connection_policy = ERRORS;
#
# ANother policy system variable, audit_log_policy, is available but does not afford as much control as audit_log_connection_policy and
# audit_log_statement_policy.
#
# It can be set only at server startup. At runtime, it is a readonly variable, it takes a value of ALL (log all events; this is the default),
# LOGINS (log connection events), QUERIES (log statement events), or NONE (do not log events).
#
# For any of those values, the audit log plugin logs all selected events without distinction as to
# success or failure.
#
# Use of audit_log_policy at startup works as follows:
#
# 		) If you do not set audit_log_policy or set it to its default of ALL, any explicit settings for audit_log_connection_policy
# 			or audit_log_statement_policy apply as specified.
#
# 			If not specified, they default to ALL.
#
# 		) If you set audit_log_policy to a non-ALL value, that value takes precedence over and is used to set
# 			audit_log_connection_policy and audit_log_statement_policy, as indicated in the following table.
#
# 			If you also set either of those variables to a value other than their default of ALL, the server
# 			writes a message to the error log to indicate that their values are being overridden.
#
# STARTUP AUDIT_LOG_POLICY VALUE 			RESULTING AUDIT_LOG_CONNECTION_POLICY VALUE 		RESULTING AUDIT_LOG_STATEMENT_POLICY VALUE
#
# LOGINS 											ALL 															NONE
# 
# QUERIES 											NONE 															ALL
#
# NONE 												NON 															NONE
#
# AUDIT LOG REFERENCE
#
# to install the audit log tables and functions, use the instructions provided earlier.
# Unless those components are installed, the audit_log plugin operates in legacy mode.
#
# AUDIT LOG TABLES
#
# MYSQL Enterprise AUdit uses tables in the mysql system database for persistent storage of filter and user account data.
# The tables can be accessed only by users with privlege for that DB.
#
# The tables use the InnoDB storage engine.
#
# If htese tables are missing, the audit_log plugin operates in legacy mode.
#
# The audit_log_filter table stores filter definitions.
# The table has these columns:
#
# 		) NAME
# 
# 			The filter name
#
# 		) FILTER
#
# 			The filter definition associated with the filter name. Definitions are stored as JSON values.
#
# The audit_log_user table stores user account information. The table has these columns:
#
# 		) USER
#
# 			The user name part of an account. For an account user1@localhost, the USER part is user1.
#
# 		) HOST
#
# 			The host name part of an account. For an account user1@localhost, the HOST part is localhost.
#
# 		) FILTERNAME
#
# 			The name of the filter assigned to the account.
# 			The filter name associates the account with a filter defined in the audit_log_filter table.
#
# AUDIT LOG FUNCTIONS
#
# THis section describes, for each audit log user-defined functions (UDFs), its purpose, calling sequence,
# and return value.
#
# For information about the conditions under which these UDFs can be invoked, see earlier.
#
# Each audit log UDF returns a string that indicates whether the operation succeeded.
# OK indicates success. ERROR: message indicates failure.
#
# These audit log UDFs are available:
# 
# 		) audit_log_encryption_password_get()
#
# 			Retrieves the current audit log encryption password as a binary string.
# 			The password is fetched from the MySQL keyring, which must be enabled or an error occurs.
#
# 			Any keyring plugin can be used.
#
# 			For additional information about audit log encryption, see later.
#
# 			Arguments: None
#
# 			Return value: 	The PW string for success (up to 766 bytes), or NULL and an error for failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_encryption_password_get();
# 				+----------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_encryption_password_get() 	  |
# 				+----------------------------------------+
# 				| secret 										  |
# 				+----------------------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_encryption_password_set(password)
#
# 			Sets the audit log encryption password and stores it in the MySQL keyring, which must be 
# 			enabled or an error occurs.
#
# 			Any keyring plugin can be used, for more info, see keyrings.
#
# 			For additional information about audit log encryption, see later.
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				password: The passwrong string. The max length is 766 bytes.
#
# 			Return value:
#
# 				1 for success, 0 for failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_encryption_password_set(password);
# 				+-------------------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_encryption_password_set(password) 	  |
# 				+-------------------------------------------------+
# 				| 1 															  |
# 				+-------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_flush()
#
# 			Calling any of the other filtering UDFs affects operational audit log filtering immediately and updates
# 			the audit log tables.
#
# 			If instead you modify the contents of those tables directly using statements such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE,
# 			the changes do not affect filtering immediately.
#
# 			To flush your changes and make them operational, call audit_log_filter_flush()
#
# 			audit_log_filter_flush() affects all current sessions and detaches them from their previous filters.
# 			Current sessions are no longer logged unless they disconnect and reconnect, or execute a change-user operation.
#
# 			If this function fails, an error message is returned and the audit log is disabled until the next successful call to
# 			audit_log_filter_flush().
#
# 			Arguments: None
#
# 			Return: A string that indicates whether the operaiton succeeded. OK indicates success. ERROR: message indicates failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_filter_flush();
# 				+-------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_filter_flush()|
# 				+-------------------------+
# 				| OK 							  |
# 				+-------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_remove_filter(filter_name)
#
# 			Given a filter name, removes the filter from the current set of filters.
# 			It is not an error for the filter not to exist.
#
# 			If a removed filter is assigned to any user accounts, those users stop being filtered
# 			(they are removed from the audit_log_user table)
#
# 			Termination of filtering includes any current sessions for those users:
#
# 				They are detached from the filter and no longer logged. 
#
# 			Arguments: filter_name: A string that specifies the filter name.
#
# 			Returns: a string that indicates whether the operation succeeded. OK indicates success. ERROR: message indicates failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_filter_remove_filter('SomeFilter');
# 				+---------------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_filter_remove_filter('SomeFilter')|
# 				+---------------------------------------------+
# 				| OK 														 |
# 				+---------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_remove_user(user_name)
#
# 			Given a user account name, cause the user to be no longer assigned to a filter.
#
# 			It is not an error if the user has no filter assigned. 
# 			Filtering of current sessions for the user remains unaffected.
#
# 			New connections for the user are filtered using the default account filter
# 			if there is one, and are not logged otherwise.
#
# 			If the name is %, the function removes the default account filter that is used for
# 			any user account that has no explicitly assigned filter.
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				) user_name: The user account name as a string in user_name@host_name format, or % to represent
# 									the default account.
#
# 			Return value:
#
# 				A string that indicates whether the operation succeeded. OK indicates success. 
# 				ERROR: message indicates failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_filter_remove_user('user1@localhost');
# 				+------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_filter_remove_user('user1@localhost') 		 |
# 				+------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| OK 																	 |
# 				+------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_set_filter(filter name, definition)
#
# 			Given a filter name and definition, adds the filter to the current set of filters. If the filter already exists
# 			and is used by any current sesisons, those sessions are detached from the filter and are no longer logged.
#
# 			This occurs because the new filter definition has a new filter ID that differs from its previous ID.
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				) filter_name: A string that specifies the filter name.
#
# 				) definition: A JSON value that specifies the filter definition..
#
# 			Return value:
#
# 				A string that indicates whether the operation succeeded.
# 				OK indicates success. ERROR: message indicates failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SET @f = '{ "filter": { "log": false } }';
# 				SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('SomeFilter', @f);
# 				+----------------------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_filter_set_filter('SomeFilter', @f) 	  |
# 				+----------------------------------------------------+
# 				| OK 																  |
# 				+----------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_filter_set_user(user_name, filter_name)
#
# 			Given a user account name and a filter name, assigns the filter to the user.
#
# 			A user can be assigned only one filter, so if the user was already assigned a filter,
# 			the assignment is replaced.
#
# 			Filtering of current sessions for the user remains unaffected.
#
# 			New connections are filtered using the new filter.
#
# 			As a special case, the name % represents the default account.
#
# 			The filter is used for connections from any user account that has no explicitly assigned filter.
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				) User_name: The user account name as a string in user_name@host_name format, or % to represent the default account.
#
# 				) filter_name: A string that specifies the filter name.
#
# 			Return value:
#
# 				A string that indicates whether the operation succeeded. OK indicates success. ERROR: messages indicate failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('user1@localhost', 'SomeFilter');
# 				+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_filter_set_user('user1@localhost', 'SomeFilter') 		|
# 				+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| OK 																					|
# 				+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_read([arg])
#
# 			Reads events from the audit log and returns a binary JSON string containing an array of audit events.
#
# 			IF the audit log format is not JSON, an error occurs.
#
# 			Each event in the return value is a JSON hash, except that the last array element may be a JSON null value 
# 			to indicate no following events are available to read.
#
# 			For hte first call to audit_log_read() within a session, pass a bookmark indicating where to begin reading.
#
# 			If the final value of the returned array is not a JSON null value, there are more events following
# 			those just read and audit_log_read() can be called without or with a bookmark argument.
#
# 			Without an argument, reading continues with the next unread event. With a bookmark argument, reading continues from the bookmark.
#
# 			If the final value of hte returned array is a JSON null value, there are no more events left to be read
# 			and the next call to audit_log_read() must include a bookmark argument.
#
# 			To obtain a bookmark for the most recently written event, call audit_log_read_bookmark()
#
# 			For additional info about audit log-reading functions, see later.
#
# 			Arguments:
#
# 				arg: An optional bookmark, represented as a string containing a JSON hash that indicates where and how much to read.
# 						The following items are significant in the arg value (other items are ignored):
#
# 						) timestamp, id: The location within the audit log of the first event to read.
# 												Both items must be present to completely specify a position.
#
# 						) max_array_length: The maximum number of events ot read from the log.
#
# 													If omitted, the default is to read to the end of the log or until
# 													the read buffer is full, whichever comes first.
#
# 			Return value:
#
# 				A binary JSON string containing an array of audited events for success, or NULL and an error for failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_read(audit_log_read_bookmark());
# 				+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_read(audit_log_read_bookmark()) 			  							  |
# 				+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| [ {"timestamp":"2018-01-15 22:41:24", "id":0, "class":"connection", ... |
# 				+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) audit_log_read_bookmark()
#
# 			Returns a binary JSON string representing a bookmark for the most recently written audit log event.
#
# 			IF the audit log format is not JSON, an error occurs.
#
# 			The bookmark is a JSON hash with a timestamp and id items indicating the event position within
# 			the audit log.
#
# 			It is suitable for passing to audit_log_read() to indicate to that function where ot begin reading.
#
# 			For additional information about log-reading functions, see later.
#
# 			Arguments: None
#
# 			Returns: A binary JSON string containing a bookmark for success, or NULL and an error for failure.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT audit_log_read_bookmark();
# 				+-------------------------------------------------+
# 				| audit_log_read_bookmark() 							  |
# 				+-------------------------------------------------+

# AUDIT LOG OPTIONS AND VARIABLES
#
# This section describes the command options and system variables that control operation of MySQL Enterprise Audit.
#
# If values specified at startup time are incorrect, the audit_log plugin may fail to initialize
# properly and the server does not load it.
#
# In this case, teh server may also produce error messages for other audit log settings
# because it will not recognize them.
#
# To control the activation of the audit log plugin, use this option:
#
# 	) --audit-log[=value]
#
# 			Property 			Value
#  		Cmd-line 			--audit-log[=value]
# 			Introduced: 		8.0.11
# 			Type: 				Enumeration
# 			Default: 			ON
# 			Valid: 				ON, OFF, FORCE, FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
#
# This option controls how the server loads the audit_log plugin at startup.
#
# It is available only if the plugin has been previously registered with INSTALL_PLUGIN or is loaded with
# --plugin-load or --plugin-load-add
#
# The option value should be one of those available for plugin-loading options, as described
# in the installation parts.
#
# For example, --audit-log=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT tells the server to load the plugin and prevent it from
# being removed while the server is running.
#
# If the audit log plugin is enabled, it exposes several system variables that permit control over logging:
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'audit_log%';
# 		+-------------------------------------------+
# 		| Variable_name 					 | value      |
#		+-------------------------------------------+

# 		Max: (64-bit) 			a lot
# 		mAx (32-bit) 			Less
#
# 		When the audit log plugin writes events to the log asynchronously, it uses a buffer to store event
# 		contents prior to writing them.
#
# 		This variable controls the size of that buffer, in bytes.
#
# 		The server adjusts the value to a multiple of 4096.
#
# 		The plugin uses a single buffer, which it allocates when it initializes and removes
# 		when it terminates.

#
# 			NONE 		Do not log connection events
#
# 			NOTE:
# 				At server startup, any explicit value given for audit_log_connection_policy
# 				may be overridden if audit_log_policy is also specified.
#
# ) audit_log_current_session
#
# 		Property 				Value
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 		System var: 			audit_log_current_session
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				depends on filtering policy
#
# 		Whether audit logging is enabled for the current session. 
# 		The session value of this variable is read only.
#
# 		It is set when the session begins based on teh values of the audit_log_include_accounts
# 		and audit_log_exclude_accounts system variables.
#
# 		The audit log plugin uses the session value to determine whether 
# 		to audit events for the session.
#
# 		(There is a global value, but hte plugin does not use it)
#
# ) audit_log_encryption
#
# 		Property 				Value
# 		Cmd line: 				--audit-log-encryption=value
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 		System var: 			audit_log_encryption

# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				NULL
#
# 		NOTE: This applies only to legacy mode audit log filtering
#
# 		The accounts for which events should not be logged.
#
# 		The value should be NULL, or a string containing a list of one or more comma-separated
# 		account names.
#
# 		For more info, read earlier.
#
# 		MOdifications to audit_log_exclude_accounts affect only connections created subsequent
# 		to the modifcation, not existing connections.
#
# ) audit_log_file
#
# 		Property 				Value
# 		cmd line: 				--audit-log-file=file_name
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 		System variable: 		audit_log_file
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					File name
# 		Default: 				audit.log
#
# 		The base name and suffix of the file to which the audit log plugin writes events.
#
# 		The default value is audit.log, regardless of logging format.
#
# 		To have the name suffix correspond to the format, set hte name explicitly,
# 		choosing a different suffix (for example, audit.xml or XML format, audit.json for JSON format)
#
# 		If the value of audit_log_file is a relative path name, the plugin interprets it relative to the data directory.
# 		IF the value is a full path name, the plugin uses the value as is.

# 		A full path name may be useful if it is desirable to locate audit files on a separate file system or directory.
#
# 		For security reasons, the audit log file should be written to a directory accessible only to the MySQL
# 		server and users with a legitimate reason to  view the log. 
#
# 		For details about how the audit log plugin interprets the audit_log_file values and the rules for file renaming
# 		that occurs at plugin initializaiton and termination, see earlier.
#
# 		The audit log plugin uses the directory containing the audit log file (determined from the audit_log_file value)
# 		as the location to search for readable audit log files.
#
# 		From these log files and the current file, the plugin constructs a list of the ones that are subject
# 		to use with the audit log bookmarking and reading functions.
#
# ) audit_log_filter_id
#
# 		Property 				Value
# 		Introduced: 			8.0.11
# 		Sys var: 				audit_log_filter_id
# 		Scope: 					Global, Session
# 		Dynamic: 				No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 			No
# 		Type: 					integer
#
# 		The session value of this variable indicates the internally maintained ID of the audit files for the current session.
# 		A value of 0 means that the session has no filter assigned.
#
# ) audit_log_flush
#
# 		Property 				Value
# 		INtroduced 				8.0.11
# 		Sys var: 				audit_log_flush
# 		Scope: 					Global
# 		Dynamic: 				Yes
# 		SET_VAR HINT: 			No
# 		Type: 					Boolean
# 		Default: 				OFF
#
# 		When this variable is set to enabled (1 or ON), the audit log plugin closes and reopens its log file to flush it.
# 		(The value remains OFF so that you need not disable it explicitly before enabling it again to perform another flush).
#
# 		Enabling this variable has no effect unless audit_log_rotate_on_size is 0.
#
# 		For more info, see earlier.
#
# ) audit_log_format
#
# 		Property 				Value
# 		Cmd line: 				--audit-log-format=value

# 		SET_VAR HINT: 			No
# 		Type: 					String
# 		Default: 				NULL
#
# 		NOTE: This only applies to legacy mode audit log filtering.
#
# 		The accounts for which events should be logged. The value should be NULL or a string containing a list
# 		of one or more comma separated account names.
#
# 		Modifications to audit_log_include_accounts affect only connections created subsequently to the modifciation, not existing connections.
#
# ) audit_log_policy
#

# 		Type: 					Enumeration
# 		Default: 				ALL
# 		Valid: 					ALL, LOGINS, QUEIES, NONE
#
# 		NOTE: This only applies to legacy mode audit log filtering
#
# 		The policy controlling how the audit login plugin writes events to its log file.
# 		The following table shows the permitted values:
#
# 		Value 		Desc
# 		ALL 			Log all events
# 		LOGINS 		Log only login events
# 		QUERIES 		Log only query events
# 		NONE 			Log nothing (disable the audit stream)
#
# 		audit_log_policy can be set only at server startup.
# 		At runtime, it is a read-only variable.
#
# 		Two other system variables, audit_log_connection_policy and audit_log_statement_policy,
# 		provide finer control over logging policy and can be set either at startup or at runtime.
#
# 		If you use audit_log_policy at startup instead of the other two variables, the server uses
# 		its value to set those variables.
#
# ) audit_log_read_buffer_size
#
# 		PROPERTY 					Value
# 		Cmd line: 					--audit-log-read-buffer-size=#
# 		Introduced: 				8.0.11
# 		Sys var (>= 8.0.11) 		audit_log_read_buffer_size
#
# 		Scope (>= 8.0.12) 		global, Session
# 		scope (8.0.11) 			Global

#
# 		Min (>= 8.0.12) 			32768
# 		Min (8.0.11) 				1024
# 		Max: 							4194304
#
# 		The buffer size for reading from the audit log file, in bytes.
# 		The audit_log_read() function reads no more than this many bytes.
#
# 		Log file reading is supported only for JSON logging format.
#
# 		As of MySQL 8.0.12, this var has a default of 32kb and can be set at runtime.
#
# 		Each client should set its session value of audit_log_read_buffer_size
# 		appropriately for its use of audit_log_read().
#
# 		Prior to MySQL 8.0.12, audit_log_read_buffer_size has a default of 1MB,
# 		affects all clients, and can be changed only at server startup.
#
# ) audit_log_rotate_on_size
#
# 		Property 					Value
# 		Cmd line: 					--audit-log-rotate-on-size=N
# 		Introduced: 				8.0.11
# 		Sys var: 					audit_log_rotate_on_size
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						integer
# 		Default value: 			0
#
# 		If the audit_log_rotate_on_size value is 0, the audit log plugin does not perform automatic log file rotation..
# 		Instead, use audit_log_flush() to close and reopen the log on demmand.
#
# 		IN this case, manually rename the file externally to the server before flushing it.
#
# 		If the audit_log_rotate_on_size value is greater than 0, automatic size-based log file rotation occurs.
#
# 		Whenever a write to the log file causes its size to exceed the audit_log_rotate_on_size value,
# 		the audit log plugin closes the current log file, renames it and opens a new log file.
#
# 		For more info about audit log file rotation, see later.
#
# 		If you set this variable to a value that is not a multiple of 4096, it is truncated to the nearest multiple.
# 		(Thus, setting it to a value less than 4096 bytes has the effect of setting it to 0 and no rotation occurs, except manually)
#
# ) audit_log_statement_policy
#
# 		Property 					Value
# 		Cmd line: 					--audit-log-statement-policy=value
# 		Introduced: 				8.0.11

# 		Valid: 						ALL, ERRORS, NONE
#
# 		NOTE: Only applies to legacy audit log filtering
#
# 		The policy controlling how the audit log plugin writes statement events to its log file.
# 		The following table shows the permitted values:
#
# 		Value 		Desc
#
# 		ALL 			Log all statemnts events
#
# 		ERRORS 		Log only failed statement events
#
# 		NONE 			Do not log statement events 		
#
# 		NOTE:
# 			At server startup, any explicit value given for audit_log_statement_policy may be overridden if audit_log_policy is also specified,
# 			as described earlier.
#
# ) audit_log_strategy
#
# 		Property 					Value
# 		Cmd line: 					--audit-log-strategy=value
# 		Introduced: 				8.0.11
# 		System var: 				audit_log_strategy
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					No
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Enumeration
# 		DEfault: 					ASYNCHRONOUS
# 		Valid: 						ASYNCHRONOUS, PERFORMANCE, SEMISYNCHRONOUS, SYNCHRONOUS
#
# 		The logging method used by the audit log plugin. These strategy values are permitted:
#
# 			Asynchronous: Log asynchronously. Wait for space in the output buffer.
#
# 			Performance: Log asynchronously. Drop requests for which there is insufficient space in the output buffer.
#
# 			Semisynchronous: Log synchronously. Permit caching by the operating system.
#
# 			Synchronous: Log synchronously. Call sync() after each request.
#
# AUDIT LOG STATUS VARIABLES
#
# If the audit log plugin is enabled, it exposes several status variables that provide operational information.
# These variables are available for legacy mode audit filtering and JSON mode audit filtering:
#
# 		) Audit_log_current_size
# 		
# 			The size of the current audit log file. The value increases when an event is written to the log and is reset ot 0 when the log is rotated.
#
# 		) Audit_log_event_max_drop_size
# 	
# 			The size of the largest dropped event in performance logging mode. #
# 
# 		) Audit_log_events
#
# 			The number of events handled by the audit log plugin, whether or not they were written to the log based on filtering policy
#
# 		) Audit_log_events_filtered
#
# 			The numbenr of events handled by the audit log plugin that were filtered (not written to the log) based on filtering policy
#
# 		) Audit_log_events_lost
#
# 			The number of events lost in performance logging mode because an event was larger than the available audit log buffer space.
# 			This value may be useful for assessing how to set audit_log_buffer_size to size the buffer for performance mode.
#
# 		) Audit_log_events_written
#
# 			The number of events written to the audit log.
#
# 		) Audit_log_total_size
#
# 			The total size of events written to all audit log files. 
# 			Unlike Audit_log_current_size, the value of Audit_log_total_size increases even when the log is rotated.
#
# 		) Audit_log_write_waits
#
# 			The number of times an event had to wait for space in teh audit log buffer in asynchronously logging mode.
# 
#
# AUDIT LOG RESTRICTIONS
#
# MysQL Enterprise audit is subject to these general restrictions:
#
# 		) Only SQL statements are logged. Changes made by no-SQL APIs, such as memcached, Node.JS and the NDB API are not logged.
#
# 		) Only top-level statements are logged, not statements within stored programs such as triggers or stored procedures.
#
# 		) Contents of files referenced by statements such as LOAD_DATA_INFILE are not logged.
#
# NDB CLUSTER -> It is possible to use MySQL Enterprise Audit with MySQL NDB cluster, subject to the following conditions:
#
# 		) All changes to be logged must be done using the SQL interface.
# 			Changes using no-SQL interfaces, such as those provided by the NDB API, memcached, or ClusterJ, are not logged.
#
# 		) The plugin must be installed on each MySQl server that is used to execute SQL on the cluster.
#
# 		) Audit plugin data must be aggreggated amongst all MySQL servers used with the cluster.
# 			This aggreggation is the responsibility of the application or user.
#
# MySQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL
#
# MySQL Enterprise Edition includes MySQL Enterprise Firewall, an application-level firewall that enables datbase 
# admins to permit or deny SQL statements execution based on matching against whitelists or accepted statement patterns.
#
# This helps harden the MySQL server against attackers such as SQL injections or attempts to exploit applicaitons by using
# them outside of their legitimate query workload characteristics.
#
# Each MySQL account registered with the firewall has its own statement whitelist, enabling protection to be tailored
# per account.
#
# For a given account, the firewall can operate in recording, protecting or detecting mode, for training
# in the accepted statement patterns, active protection against unacceptable statements, or passive detection of unacceptable
# statements.
#
# This figure illustreates how the firewall processes incoming statements in each mode:

#
# The following sections describe the components of MYSQL Enterprise Firewall, discuss how ot install it and use it,
# and provide reference info for its components.
#
# MySQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL COMPONENTS
#
# MySQL Enterprise Firewall is based on a plugin library that implements these components:
#
# 		) A server-side plugin named MySQL_FIREWALL examines SQL statements before htey execute,
# 			and based on it's in-memory cache, renders a decision whether to execute or reject each statement.
#
# 		) Server-side plugins named MySQL_FIREWALL_USERS and MYSQL_FIREWALL_WHITELIST implement INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables that provide
# 			views into the firewall data cache.
#
# 		) System tables named firewall_users and firewall_whitelist in the mysql databse provide persistent storage of firewall data.
#
# 		) Stored procedures named sp_set_firewall_mode() and sp_reload_firewall_rules() performs tasks such as registering
# 			MySQl accounts with the firewall, establishing their operational mode, and managing transfer of firewall data
# 			between the cache and the underlying system tables.
#
# 		) A user of user-defined functions provide an SQL-level API for lower-level tasks such as syncrhonizing the cahce 
# 			with the underlying system tables.
#
# 		) System variables enable firewall configuration and status variables provide runtime operational information.
#
# 		) FIREWALL_ADMIN and FIREWALL_USER privileges enables users to administer firewall rules for any user, and their own firewall rules, respectively.
#
# INSTALLING OR UNINSTALLING MySQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL
#
# MySQL Enterprise Firewall installation is a one-time operaiton that installs the components described earlier.
#
# Installation can be pformed using a grpahical interface or manually:
#
# 		) On Windows MySQL isntaller includes an option to enable MySQL Enterpise Firewall for you.
#
# 		) MySQL WOrkbench 6.3.4 >= can install MySQL Enterprise Firewall, enable or disable an installed firewall,
# 			or uninstall the firewall..
#
# 		) Manual MYSQL enterprise firewall installation involves running a script located in the share directory
# 			of your MySQL installation.
#
# 		NOTE: 
# 			If installed, MySQL Enterprise FIrewall involves some minimal overhead, even when disabled.
# 			To avoid this overhead, do not install lest you intend to use it.
#
# 		Note:
# 			MySQL Enteprise Firewall does not work together with the query cache.
# 			IF the query cache is enabled, disable it before installing the firewall.
#
# INSTALLING MYSQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL
#
# If MySQL Enterprise Firewall is already installed from an older version of MysQl, uninstall it.
#
# The installation script is in the share directory of the MySQL installation.
#
# win_install_firewall.sql for Windows based, linux_install_firewall.sql for Linux based.
#
# The installation script creates stored procedures in the default database, so choose a database to use.
# Then run the script as follows, naming the chosen databse on the cmdl ine.
#
# The example here uses hte mysql database and the Linux installation script.
#
# Make hte appropriate substitution for your system.
#
# mysql -u root -p mysql < linux_install_firewall.sql
# Enter password: (enter password here)
#
# INstalling MysQL ENterprise Firewall either using a graphical interface or manually should enable the firewall.
# To verify that, connect to the server and execute this statement:
#
# SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'mysql_firewall_mode';
# +-----------------------------+
# | Variable_name      | Value  |
# +-----------------------------+
# | Mysql_firewall_mode| ON 	  |
# +-----------------------------+
#
# UNINSTALLING MYSQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL
#
# MySQL Enteprise Firewall can be uninstalled using MySQL workbench or manually.
#
# To uninstall MySQl Enterprise Firewall using MysQL workbench 6.3.4 or higehr, see respective place.
#
# To uninstall MySQL Enterprise firewall manually, exceute the following statements.
# it is assumed that the stored procedures were created in the MySQL databse.
#
# Adjust the DROP_PROCEDURE statements appropriately if the procedures were created
# in a different DB.
#
# DROP TABLE mysql.firewall_whitelist;
# DROP TABLE mysql.firewall_users;
#
# UNINSTALL PLUGIN mysql_firewall;
# UNINSTALL PLUGIN mysql_firewall_whitelist;
# UNINSTALL PLUGIN mysql_firewall_users;
#
# DROP FUNCTION set_firewall_mode;
# DROP FUNCTION normalize_statement;
# DROP FUNCTION read_firewall_whitelist;
#
# DROP FUNCTION read_firewall_users;
# DROP FUNCTION mysql_firewall_flush_status;
#
# DROP PROCEDURE mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode;
# DROP PROCEDURE mysql.sp_reload_firewall_rules 
#
# USING MYSQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL
#
# Before using MYSQL Enterprise Firewall, install it according to the instructions previously.
#
# Also, MySQL Enterprise Firewall does not work together with the query cache; disable the query cache
# if it is enabled.
#
# THis section describes how to configure MySQL Enterprise Firewall using SQL statements.
# Alternatively, the workbench provides a UI for it.
#
# To enable or disable the firewall, set the mysql_firewall_mode system variable.
#
# by default, this variable is enabled when the firewall is installed.
# To control the install firewall state explicitly, you can set the variable at server startup.
#
# Fo rexample, to enable the firewall in an option file, use these lines:
#
# 	[mysqld]
# 	mysql_firewall_mode=ON
#
# It is also possible to disalbe or enable the firewall at runtime:
#
# 	SET GLOBAL mysql_firewall_mode = OFF;
# 	SET GLOBAL mysql_firewall_mode = ON;
#
# In addition to the global on/off firewall mode, each account registered with the firewall has its own operational mode.
#
# For an account in recording mode, the firewall learns an applications "fingerprint", that is, the acceptable
# statement patterns that taken together - form a whitelist.
#
# After training, switch the firewall to protecting mode to harden MySQL against access by statements that deviate from
# the fingerprint.
#
# For additional training, switch the firewall back to recording mode as necessary to update the
# whitelist with new statement patterns.
#
# An instrusion-detection mode is avialable that writes supsicious statements ot hte error log but does not deny access.
#
# The firewall maintains whitelist rules on a per-account basis, enabling implementation of protection strats such as these:
#
# 	) For an applicaiton that has unique protection requirements, configure it to use an account that is not used for any other purpose.
#
# 	) For applications that are related and share protection requirements, configure them as group to use the same account.
#
# Firewall operations is based on conversion of SQL statements to normalized digest form.
# Firewall digests are like the statement digest used by the Performance Schema (mroe on that later).
#
# However, unlike the Performance Schema, the relevant digest-related system variable is max_digest_length.
#
# For a connection from a registered account, the firewall converts each incoming statement to normalized form
# and processes it accoring to the account mode:
#
# 	) IN recording mode, the firewall adds the normalized statement to the account whitelist rules.
#
# 	) In protection mode, the firewall compares the normalized statement to the account whitelist rules.
#
# 		If there is a match, teh statement passes and the server continues to process it.
#
# 		Otherwise, the server rejects the statement and returns an error to the client.
#
# 		The firewall also writes the rejected statement to the erorr log if the mysql_firewall_trace system
# 		variable is enabled.
#
# 	) IN detecting mode, the firewall matches statements as in protecting mode, but writes nonmatching
# 		statements ot the error log without denying access.
#
# accounts that have a mode of OFF or are not registered with the firewall are ignored by it.
#
# TO protect an account using MySQL Enterprise FIrewall,, follow these steps:
#
# 1. Register an account and put it in recording mode.
#
# 2. Connect to the MySQL server using the registered acc and execute statements otb e learned.
# 		This establishes the account whitelist of accepted statements.
#
# 3. Switch the registered account to protecting mode.
#
# THe following examples shows how to reigster an account with the firewall, use the firewall to learn acceptable
# statements for that account and protect the account against execution of unacceptable statements.
#
# The example account, 'fwuser'@'localhost' is for use by an application that accesses tables in the sakila DB.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		THe user and host parts of the account name are quoted separately for statements such as CREATE_USER
# 		and GRANT, whereas to specify an account for use with a firewall component, name it as a single quoted
# 		string 'fwuser@localhost'
#
# 		The convention for naming accounts as a single quoted string for firewall components means that you cannot
# 		use accounst that have embedded @ chars in the user name.
#
# Perform the step in the following procedure as an ADMIN priv acc, except those designated for execution by the acc registered
# with the firewall.
#
# The default DB should be sakila, for statements executed using the registered account.
#
# 1. IF called for, create teh acc to be protected (choose an appropriate pW), and grant privs for the saila DB:
#
# 		CREATE USER 'fwuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'fWp@3sw0rd';
# 		GRANT ALL on sakila.* to 'fwuser'@'localhost';
#
# 2. use the sp_set_firewall_mode() stored procedure to register the account with the firewall and place it in recording mode.
# 		(If the procedure is located in a database other than MySQL - adjust the statement accordingly):
#
# 		CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode('fwuser@lcoalhost', 'RECORDING');
#
# 		During the course of its execution, the stored procedure invokes firewall user-defiend functions, which may produce output of their own.
#
# 3. Using the registered account, connect to the server, then execute some statements that are legitimate for it:
#
# 		SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = 1;
# 		UPDATE rental SET return_date = NOW() WHERE rental_id = 1;
# 		SELECT get_customer_balance(1, NOW());
#
# The firewall converts the statements to digest form and records them in the account whitelist.
#
# NOTE:
# 		uNtil the account executes statements in recording mode, its whitelist is empty.
# 		Which is equvialent to "deny all".
#
# 		IF switched to protective mode, the account will be effectively prohibited from executing statements..
#
# 4. At this point, the user and whitelist information is cached and can be seen in the firewall INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables:
#
# 		SELECT MODE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS
# 		WHERE USERHOST = 'fwuser@localhost';
# 		+-------------+
# 		| MODE 		  |
# 		+-------------+
# 		| RECORDING   |
# 		+-------------+
#
# 		SELECT RULE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MYSQL_FIREWALL_WHITELIST
# 		WHERE USERHOST = 'fwuser@localhost';
#
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| RULE 																								  |
#  	+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| SELECT `fire_name`,  `last_name` FROM `customer` WHERE `customer_id` = ? 	  |
# 		| SELECT `get_customer_balance` ( ? , NOW ( ) ) 										  |
# 		| UPDATE `rental` SET `return_date` = NOW ( ) WHERE `rental_id` = ? 				  |
# 		| SELECT @@`version_comment` LIMIT ? 														  |
# 		+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The @@version_comment rule comes from a statement sent automatically by the mysql client when
# 		you connect to the server as the registered user.
#
# 		IT is important to train teh firewall under conditions matching application use.
#
# 		For example, a given MySQL connector might send statements to the server at teh beginning
# 		of a connection to determine server characteristics and capabilities.
#
# 		IF an application normally is used through taht connector, train the firewall that way, too.
#
# 		That enables those initail statements to become part of the whitelist for the account
# 		associated with the application.
#
# 5. Use the stored procedure to switch the registered user to protecting mode:
#
# 		CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode('fwuser@localhost', 'PROTECTING');
#
# 		IMPORTANT:
#
# 				Switching the account out of RECORDING mode synchronizes its firewall cache data
# 				to the underlying mysql system database for persistent storage.
#
# 				If you do not switch the mode for a user who is being recored, the cached whitelist
# 				data is not written to the system tables and will be lost when the server is restarted.
#
# 6. Using the registered account, execute some acceptable and unacceptable statements.

# 		The firewall matches each one against the account whitelist and accepts or rejects it.
#
# 		This statement is not identical to a training statement, but produces the same normalized statement as one of them,
# 		so the firewall accepts it:
#
# 			SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = '48';
# 			+-----------------------+
# 			| first_name | last_name|
# 			+-----------------------+
# 			| ANN 		 | EVANS 	|
# 			+-----------------------+
#
# 		These statements do not match anything in the whitelist and each results in an error:
#
# 			SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = 1 OR TRUE;
# 			ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
#
# 			SHOW TABLES LIKE 'customer%';
# 			ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
#
# 			TRUNCATE TABLE mysql.slow_log;
# 			ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
#
# 		The firewall also writes the rejected statements to the error log if the mysql_firewall_trace 
# 		system variable is enabled.
#
# 		For example:
#
# 			[Note] PLugin MYSQL_FIREWALL reported:
# 			'ACCESS DENIED for fwuser@localhost. Reason: No match in whitelist.
# 			Statement: TRUNCATE TABLE `mysql`.`slow_log`'
#
# 		You can use these log messages in your efforts to identify the source of attacks.
#
# 7. You can log nonmatching statements as supsicious without denying access.
# 		To do this, put the account in intrusion-detecting mode:
#
# 			CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode('fwuser@localhost', 'DETECTING');
#
# 8. Using the registered account, connect to the server, then execute a statement that does not match
# 		the whitelist:
#
# 		SHOW TABLES LIKE 'customer%';
# 		+-----------------------------+
# 		| Tables_in_sakila (customer%)|
# 		+-----------------------------+
# 		| customer 							|
# 		| customer_list 					|
# 		+-----------------------------+
#
# 		In detecting mode, the firewall permits the nonmatching statement to execute but writes a message
# 		to the error log:
#
# 		[Note] Plugin MYSQL_FIREWALL reported:
# 		'SUSPICIOUS STATEMENT from 'fwuser@localhost'. Reason: No match in whtielist.
# 		Statement: SHOW TABLES LIKE ? '
#
# 9. To assess firewall activity, examine its status variables:
#
# 		SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Firewall%';
#		+-----------------------------------+
# 		| Variable_name 				| Value 	|
# 		+-----------------------------------+
# 		| Firewall_access_denied 	 | 3 		|
# 		| Firewall_access_granted 	 | 4 		|
# 		| Firewall_access_suspicious| 1 		|
# 		| Firewall_cached_entries 	 | 4 		|
# 		+-----------------------------------+
#
# 		The variable indicates the number of statements rejected, accepted, logged as supicious, and added to the cache, respectively.
#
# 		The Firewall_access_granted count is 4 - because of the @@version_comment statement sent by the MySQL client each 
# 		time you use it to connect as the registered user, plus the SHOW_TABLES statement that was not blocked in DETECTING mode.
#
# SHould additional training for an account be necessary, switch it to recording mode again, then back to protecting mode
# after executing statements to be added to the whitelist.
#
# MySQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL REFERENCE
#
# MySQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL TABLES
#
# MySQL Enterprise Firewall maintains account and whitelist information.
#
# It uses INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables to provide views into cached data, and tables in teh mysql system database to  		
# store this data in persistent form.
#
# When enabled, the firewall bases its operational decisions on the cached data.
#
# The INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are accessible by anyone.
#
# The MysQL tables can be accessed only by users with privileges for that database. 		
#
# The INFORMATION_SCHEMA:MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS and mysql.firewall_users table list registered firewall
# accounts and their operational modes.
#
# The tables have these columns:
#  
# 		) USERHOST
#
# 			An account registered with the firewall.
#
# 			Each account has the format user_name@host_name and represents actual user and host names as authenticated
# 			by the server.											
#
# 			Patterns and netmasks should not be used when registering users.
#
# 		) MODE
#
# 			The current firewall operation mode for the account.
#
# 			The permitted mode values are OFF, DETECTING, PROTECTING, RECORDING and RESET.
#
# 			For details about their meanings, see the description of sp_set_firewall_mode()
#
# The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MYSQL_FIREWALL_WHITELIST and mysql.firewall_whitelist tables list 
# registered firewall accounts and their whitelists.
#
# The tables have these columns:
#
# 		) USERHOST
#
# 			An account registered with the firewall. The format is the same as for the user account tables.
#
# 		) RULE
#
# 			A normalized statement indicating an acceptable statement pattern for teh account. An accounte whitelist is the union of its rules.
#
# 		) ID
#
# 			An integer column that is a primary key for the table. This was added in 8.0.12
#
# MYSQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS
#
# MySQL Enterprise Firewall has stored procedures that perform tasks such as registering
# MySQL accounts with the firewall, establishing their operational mode and managing transfer of
# firewall data between the cache and the underlying system tables. 
#
# It also has a set of user-defiend functions (UDFs) that provides an SQL-level API for low level
# tasks such as synchronizing the cache with the underlying system tables.
#
# Under normal operation, the stored procedures implemetn the user interface.
# The UDFs are invoked by the stored procedures, not directly by users.
#
# To invoke a stored procedure when the default database is not hte database that contains
# the procedure, qualify the procedure name with hte database name.,
#
# For example:
#
# 		CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode(user, mode);
#
# The following list describes each firewall stored procedure and UDF:
#
# 		) sp_reload_firewall_rules(user)
#
# 			This stored procedure uses firewall UDFs to reset a registered account and reload the
# 			in-memory rules for it from the rules stored in the mysql.firewall_whitelist table.
#
# 			This procedure provides control over firewall operation for individual accounts.
#
# 			The user argument names the affected account, as as tring in user_name@host_name format.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				CALL mysql.sp_reload_firewall_rules('fwuser@localhost');
#
# 			WARNING:
#
# 				This procedure sets the account mode to RESET, which clears the account whitelist and sets it
# 				mode to OFF.
#
# 				If the account mode was not OFF prior to the sp_reload_firewall_rules() call, use sp_set_firewall_mode()
# 				to restore its previous mode after reloading the rules.
#
# 				For example, if the account was in PROTECTING mode, that is no longer true after calling
# 				sp_reload_firewall_rules() and you must set it to PROTECTING again explicitly.
#
# 		) sp_set_firewall_mode(user,mode)
#
# 			THis stored procedure registers a MySQL account with hte firewall and establishes its operational mode.
#
# 			The procedure also invokes firewall UDFs as necessary to transfer firewall data between the cache
# 			and the underlying system tables.
#
# 			THis procedure may be called even if the mysql_firewall_mode system variable is OFF, although
# 			setting the mode for an account has no operational effect while the firewall is disabled.
#
# 			THe user argument names the affected account, as a string in user_name@host_name format.
#
# 			The mode is hte operational mode for the user, as a string. These mode values are permitted:
#
# 				) OFF: Disables the firewall for the account
#
# 				) DETECTING: Intrusion-detecting mode: Write suspicious (nonmatching) statements to the error log but do not deny access.
#
# 				) PROTECTING: Protect the account by matching incoming statements against the account whitelist.
#
# 				) RECORDING: Training mode: Record acceptable statements for the account.
#
# 								Incoming statements that do not immediately fail with a syntax error are recorded to become part
# 								of the account whitelist rules.
#
# 				) RESET: Clear the account whitelist and set the account mode to OFF.
#
# Switching the mode for an account to any mode but RECORDING synchronizes the firewall cache data to the underlying
# mysql system database for persistent storage.
#
# Switching the mode from OFF to RECORDING reloads the whitelist from the mysql.firewall_whitelist table into the cache.
#
# If an account has an empty whitelist, setting its mode to PROTECTING produces an error message that is returned
# in a result set, but not an SQL error:
#
# 		CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode('a@b', 'PROTECTING');
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| set_firewall_mode(arg_userhost, arg_mode) 			 							 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| ERROR: Protecting mode requested for a@b but the whitelist is empty.   |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		1 row in set (0.02 sec)
#
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
#
# ) mysql_firewall_flush_status()
#
# 		This UDF resets several firewall status variables to 0:
#
# 			Firewall_access_denied
# 			Firewall_access_granted
# 			Firewall_access_suspicious
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			SELECT mysql_firewall_flush_status();
#
# ) normalize_statement(stmt)
#
# 		This UDF normalizes an SQL statement into the digest form used for whitelist rules.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			SELECT normalize_statement('SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 > 2');
#
# ) read_firewall_users(user, mode)
#
# 		This aggreggate UDF updates the firewall user cache through a SELECT statement on the 
# 		mysql.firewall_users table.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			SELECT read_firewall_users('fwusers@localhost', 'RECORDING')
# 			FROM mysql.firewall_users;
#
# ) read_firewall_whitelist(user, rule)
#
# 		THis aggreggate UDF updates the recorded statement cache through a SELECT statement on the
# 		mysql.firewall_whitelist table.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 			SELECT read_firewall_whitelist('fwuser@localhost', 'RECORDING')
# 			FROM mysql.firewall_whitelist;
#
# ) set_firewall_mode(user, mode)
#
# 		This UDF manages the user cache and establishes the user operational mode.
#
# 		Example:
#
# 				SELECT set_firewall_mode('fwuser@localhost', 'RECORDING');
#
# MYSQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL SYSTEM VARIABLES
#
# MySQL Enterprise Firewall supports the following system variables.
# Use them to configure firewall operation.
#
# These variables are unavailable unless the FW is installed.
#
# 	) mysql_firewall_mode
#
# 		Property 					Value
# 		Cmd line: 					--mysql-firewall-mode={OFF|ON}
# 		Introduced: 				8.0.11
# 		Sys Var: 					mysql_firewall_mode
# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Default: 					ON
#
# 		Whether MySQL Enterprise Firewall is enabled (the default) or disabled.
#
# ) mysql_firewall_trace
#
# 		Property 					Value
# 		Cmd line: 					--mysql-firewall-trace={OFF|ON}

# 		Scope: 						Global
# 		Dynamic: 					Yes
# 		SET_VAR Hint: 				No
# 		Type: 						Boolean
# 		Default: 					OFF
#
# 		Whether the MySQL Enterprise Firewall Trace is enabled or disabled (the default).
#
# 		WHen mysql_firewall_trace is enabled, for PROTECTING mode, the firewall writes
# 		rejected statements to the error log.
#
# MYSQL ENTERPRISE FIREWALL STATUS VARIABLES
#
# MySQL ENterprise Firewall supports hte following status variables.
#
# Use them to obtain information about firewall operational status.
# THese variables are unavailabel unless hte firewall is installed.
#
# Firewall status variables are set to 0 whenever the MYSQL_FIREWALL plugin is installed
# or the server is started.
#
# Many of them are reset to zero by the mysql_firewall_flush_status UDF.
#
# ) Firewall_access_denied
#
# 		The number of statements rejected by MySQL Enterprise Firewall
#
# ) Firewall_access_granted
#
# 		The number of statements accepted by MySQL Enterprise Firewall
#
# ) Firewall_access_suspicious
#
# 		Number of statements logged by the MySQl Enterprise Firewall as Suspicious for users who are in DETECTING mode.
#
# ) Firewall_cached_entries
#
# 		The number of statements recorded by MySQL Enterprise Firewall, including duplicates.
#
# MySQL ENTERPRISE DATA MASKING AND DE-IDENTIFICATION
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition.
#
# As of MySQL 8.0.13, MySQL Enterprise Edition provides data masking and de-identification capabilities:
#
# 		) Transformation of existing data to mask it and remove identifying characteristics, such as changing
# 			all digits of a credit card number but the last four to 'X' Chars.
#
# 		) Generation of random data, such as email addresses and payment card numbers.
#
# The way that applications use these capabilities depends on the purpose for which the data will be used
# and who will access it:
#
# 		) Applications that use sensitive data may protect it by performing data masking and permiting use
# 			of partially masked data for client identification.
#
# 			Example: A call center may ask for clients to provide their last four social security number digits.
#
# 		) Applications that require properly formatted data, but not necessarily the original data, can synthesize sample data.
#
# 			Example: An application developer who is testing data validators but has no access to original data may synthesize
#  					random data with the same format.
#
# Example 1:
#
# 		Medical research facilities can hold patient data that comprises a mix of personal and medical data.
# 		This may include genetic sequences (long strings), test results stored in JSON format, and other data types.
#
# 		Although the data may be used mostly by automated analysis software, access to genome data or test results
# 		of particular patients is still possible.
#
# 		In such cases, data masking should be used to render this information not personally identifiable.
#
# Example 2:
#
# 		A credit card processor company provides a set of services using sensitive data, such as:
#
# 			) Processing a large number of financial transactions per second
#
# 			) Storing a large amount of transaction-related data.
#
# 			) Protecting transaction-related data with strict requirements for personal data.
#
# 			) Handling client complaints about transactions using reversible or partially masked data.
#
# A typical transaction may include many types of sensitive information, including:
#
# 		) Credit card number
#
# 		) Transaction type and amount
#
# 		) Merchant type
#
# 		) Transaction cryptogram (to confirm transaction legitimacy)
#
# 		) Geolocation of GPS-equipped terminal (for fraud detection)
#
# Those types of information may then be joined within a bank or other card-issuing financial institution
# with client personal data, such as:
#
# 		) Full cient name (either person or company)
#
# 		) Address
#
# 		) Date of birth
#
# 		) Social Security number
#
# 		) Email address.
#
# 		) Phone number
#
# Various employee roles within both the card processing company and the financial institution require access
# to that data.
#
# Some of these roles may require access only to masked data.
#
# Other roles may require access to the original data on a case-to-case basis, which is recorded in audit logs.
#
# Masking and de-identification are core to regulatory compliance, so MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-identificaiton
# can help application developers satisfy privacy requirements:
#
# 		) PCI - DSS: Payment Card Data
#
# 		) HIPAA: Privacy of Health Data, Heqlth Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act)
#
# 		) EU General Data Protection Directive (GDPR): Protection of Personal Data
#
# 		) Data Protection Act (UK): Protection of Personal Data
#
# 		) Sarbanes Oxley, GLBA, The USA Patriot Act, Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998.

#
# THe following sections describe the components of MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification,
# discuss how to install and use it, and provide reference information for its components.
#
# MySQL Enterprise DATA MASKING AND DE-IDENTIFICATION COMPONENTS
#
# MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification is based on a plugin library that implements these components:
#
# 		) A server-side plugin named data_masking
#
# 		) A set of user-defined functions (UDFs) provides an SQL-level API for performing masking 
# 			and de-identification operations.
#
# 			Some of these functions require the SUPER privilege.
#
# INSTALLING OR UNINSTALLING MySQL ENTERPRISE DATA MASKING AND DE-IDENTIFICATION
#
# This section describes how to install or uninstall MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification,
# which is implemented as a plugin library file containing a plugin and user-defined functions (UDFs).
#
# To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin directory
# (the directory named by the plugin_dir system variable).
#
# If necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting the value of plugin_dir at server startup.
#
# The plugin library file base name is data_masking. The file name suffix differs per platform (for example,
# .so for UNIX based systems, .dll for Windows)
#
# To install the MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification plugin and UDFs, use the INSTALL_PLUGIN and
# CREATE_FUNCTION statements (adjust the .so suffix for your platform as called for):
#
# INSTALL PLUGIN data_masking SONAME 'data_masking.so';
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_blacklist RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_dictionary RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_dictionary_drop RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
# 
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_dictionary_load RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_range RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_rnd_email RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_rng_pan RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_rnd_ssn RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION gen_rnd_us_phone RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION mask_inner RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION mask_outer RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION mask_pan RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION mask_pan_relaxed RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# CREATE FUNCTION mask_ssn RETURNS STRING SONAME 'data_masking.so';
#
# If the plugin and UDFs are used on a master replication server, install them on all slave 
# servers as well to avoid replication problems.
#
# Once installed as just described, the plugin and UDFs remain installed until uninstalled.
# To remove them, use the UNINSTALL_PLUGIN and DROP_FUNCTION statements:
#
# UNINSTALL PLUGIN data_masking;
# DROP FUNCTION gen_blacklist;
# DROP FUNCTION gen_dictionary;
# DROP FUNCTION get_dictionary_drop;
#
# DROP FUNCTION gen_dictionary_load;
# DROP FUNCTION gen_range;
# DROP FUNCTION gen_rnd_email;
# 
# DROP FUNCTION gen_rnd_pan;
# DROP FUNCTION gen_rnd_ssn;
# DROP FUNCTION gen_rnd_us_phone;
#
# DROP FUNCTION mask_inner;
# DROP FUNCTION mask_outer;
# DROP FUNCTION mask_pan;
#
# DROP FUNCTION mask_pan_relaxed;
# DROP FUNCTION mask_ssn;
#
# USING MySQL ENTERPRISE DATA MASKING AND DE-IDENTIFICATION
#
# before using MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-identification, install it.
#
# To use MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification in applications, invoke the
# functions that are appropriate for the operations you wish to perform.
#
# For detailed function desc., see later.
#
# This section demonstrates how ot use the functions to carry out some representative
# tasks.
#
# It first presents an overview of the available functions, followed by some examples of
# how the functions might be used in real-world context.
#
# MASKING DATA TO REMOVE IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS
#
# MySQL provides general-purpose masking functions that mask arbitrary strings, and special-purpose masking functions
# that mask specific types of values.
#
# GENERAL-PURPOSE MASKING FUNCTIONS
#
# mask_inner() and mask_outer() are general-purpose functions that mask parts of arbitrary strings based
# on positions within the string:
#
# 		) mask_inner() masks the interior of its string argument, leaving the ends unmasked.
# 			Other arguments specify the sizes of the unmasked ends.
#
# 			SELECT mask_inner('This is a string', 5, 1); #Leave 5 first and last 1 unmasked
# 			+------------------------------------------+
# 			| mask_inner('This is a string', 5, 1) 	 |
# 			+------------------------------------------+
# 			| This XXXXXXXXXXXXXXg 						 	 |
# 			+------------------------------------------+
#
# 			SELECT mask_inner('This is a string', 1, 5); #leave first and  5 last unmasked
# 	
# 			+------------------------------------------+
# 			| mask_inner('This is a string', 1, 5) 	 |
# 			+------------------------------------------+
# 			| Txxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxtring 					 |
# 			+------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) mask_outer() does the reverse, masking the ends of its string argument, leaving the interior unmasked.
# 			Other arguments specify the sizes of the masked ends.
#
# 			SELECT mask_outer('This is a string', 5, 1); #Mask first 5 and last
# 			+-------------------------------------------+
# 			| mask_outer('This is a string', 5, 1) 	  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------+
# 			| XXXXXXis a strinX 								  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------+
#
# 			SELECT mask_outer('This is a string', 1, 5); #Mask first and 5 last
# 			+-------------------------------------------+
# 			| mask_outer('This is a string', 1, 5) 	  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------+
# 			| Xhis is a sXXXXX 								  |
# 			+-------------------------------------------+
#
# By default, mask_inner() and mask_outer() use 'X' as the masking character, but permit an optional
# masking-character argument:
#
# 			SELECT mask_inner('This is a string', 5, 1, '*'); #Mask with * char instead
# 			+------------------------------------------------+
# 			| mask_inner('This is a string', 5, 1, '*') 		 |
# 			+------------------------------------------------+
# 			| This ****************g 								 |
# 			+------------------------------------------------+
#
# 			SELECT mask_outer('This is a string', 5, 1, '#');
# 			+------------------------------------------------+
# 			| mask_outer('This is a string', 5, 1, '#') 		 |
# 			+------------------------------------------------+
# 			| #####is a strin# 										 |
# 			+------------------------------------------------+
#
# SPECIAL-PURPOSE MASKING FUNCTIONS
#
# Other masking functions expect a string argument representing a specific type of value and mask
# it to remove identifying characteristics.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The examples here supply function arguments using the random value generation functions that return the
# 		appropriate type of value.
#
# 		More about generation functions later.
#
# PAYMENT CARD PRIMARY ACCOUNT NUMBER MASKING.
#
# Masking functions provide strict and relaxed masking of Primary Account Numbers.
#
# 		) mask_pan() masks all but the last four digits of the number:
#
# 			SELECT mask_pan(gen_rnd_pan());
# 			+-------------------------------+
# 			| mask_pan(gen_rnd_pan()) 		  |
# 			+-------------------------------+
# 			| XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX2461 		  |
# 			+-------------------------------+
#

#
# GENERATING RANDOM DATA USING DICTIONARIES
#
# MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-identification enables dictionaries to be used as sources of random values.
# To use a dictionary, it must first be loaded from a file and given a name.
#
# Each loaded dictionary becomes part of the dictionary registry.
#
# Items then can be selected from registered dictionaries and used as random values or as 
# replacements for other values.
#
# A valid dictionary file has these characteristics:
#
# 		) The file contents are plain text, one term per line.
#
# 		) Empty lines are ignored.
#
# 		) The file must contain at least one term.
#
# Suppose that a file named de_cities.txt contains these city names in Germany:
#
# 	Berlin
# 	Munich
# 	Bremen
#
# Also suppose that a file named us_cities.txt contains these city names in the U.S:
#
# 	Chicago
# 	Houston
# 	Phoenix
# 	El Paso
# 	Detroit
#
# Assume that the secure_file_priv system variable is set to /usr/local/mysql/mysql-files.
#
# IN that case, copy the dictionary files to that directory so that the MySQL server can access them.
#
# Then use gen_dictionary_load() to load the dictionaries into the dictionary registry and assign
# them names: 		
#
# SELECT gen_dictionary_load('/usr/local/mysql/mysql-files/de_cities.txt', 'DE_Cities');
# +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | gen_dictionary_load('/usr/local/mysql/mysql-files/de_cities.txt', 'DE_Cities') 		|
# +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | Dictionary load success 																				|
# +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

# | gen_dictionary_load('/usr/local/mysql/mysql-files/us_cities.txt', 'US_Cities') 	   |
# +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | Dictionary load success 																				|
# +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# To select a random term from a dictionary, use gen_dictionary():
#
# 	SELECT gen_dictionary('DE_Cities');
# 	+----------------------------------+
# 	| gen_dictionary('DE_Cities') 	  |
# 	+----------------------------------+
# 	| Berlin 								  |
#  +----------------------------------+
#
#  SELECT gen_dictionary('US_Cities');
# 	+-----------------------------------+
# 	| gen_dictionary('US_Cities') 		|
# 	+-----------------------------------+
# 	| Phoenix 									|
# 	+-----------------------------------+
#
# To select a random term from multiple dictionaries, randomly select one of the dictionaries,
# then select a term from it:
#
# SELECT gen_dictionary(ELT(gen_range(1,2), 'DE_Cities', 'US_Cities'));
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | gen_dictionary(ELT(gen_range(1,2), 'DE_Cities', 'US_Cities')) 	  |
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | Detroit 																			  |

# | gen_dictionary(ELT(gen_range(1,2), 'DE_Cities', 'US_Cities')) 	  |
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | Bremen 																				  |
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# The gen_blacklist() function enables a term from one dictionary to be replaced by a term from
# another dictionary, which effects masking by substitution.
#
# Its arguments are the term to replace, the dictionary in which the term appears, and the dictionary
# from which to choose a replacement.
#
# For example, to substitute a U.S. city for a German city, or vice versa, use gen_blacklist() like this:
#
# 		SELECT gen_blacklist('Munich', 'DE_Cities', 'US_Cities');
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| gen_blacklist('Munich', 'DE_Cities', 'US_Cities') 			 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Houston 																	 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+

# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| gen_blacklist('El Paso', 'US_Cities', 'DE_Cities') 			 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| Bremen 																	 |
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# If the term to replace is not in the first dictionary, gen_blacklist() returns it unchanged:
#
# 		SELECT gen_blacklist('Moscow', 'DE_Cities', 'US_Cities'); 	
# 		+------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| gen_blacklist('Moscow', 'DE_Cities', 'US_Cities') 			 |

#
# USING MASKED DATA FOR CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION
#
# At customer-service call centers, one common identity verification technique is to ask customers
# to provide their last four Social Security number (SSN) digits.
#
# For example, a customer might say her name is Joanna Bond and that her last four SSN digits are 0007.
#
# Suppose that a customer table containing customer records has these columns:
#
#		) id: Customer ID number.
#
# 		) first_name: Customer first name.
#
# 		) last_name: Customer last name.
#
# 		) ssn: Customer Social Security number.
#
# The application used by customer-service representatives to check the customer SSN might execute a query like this:
#
# 		SELECT id, ssn
# 		FROM customer
# 		WHERE first_name = 'Joanna' AND last_name = 'Bond';
# 		+----+------------------+
# 		| id | ssn 					|
# 		+----+------------------+
# 		|786 | 906-39-0007 		|
# 		+----+------------------+
#
# However, that exposes the SSN to the customer-service representative, who has no need to see anything but the last
# 4 digits.
#
# Instead, the application can use this query to display only the masked SSN:
#
# 		SELECT id, mask_ssn(CONVERT(ssn USING binary))
# 		FROM customer
# 		WHERE first_name = 'Joanna' AND last_name = 'Bond';
# 		+----+---------------------------------------------+
# 		| id | mask_ssn(CONVERT(ssn USING binary)) 			|
# 		+----+---------------------------------------------+
# 		|786 | XXX-XX-0007 											|
# 		+----+---------------------------------------------+
#
# Now the representative sees only what is necessary, and customer privacy is preserved.
#
# Why was the CONVERT() function used for the argument to mask_ssn()?
#
# Because mask_ssn() requires an argument of length 11, and because UDFs treat string arguments
# as binary strings, with one byte par char.
#
# Thus, even though ssn is defined as VARCHAR(11), if the ssn column has a multibyte character set,
# it appears ot be longer than 11 bytes when passed to a UDF, and an error occurs.
#
# Converting the value to a binary string ensures that hte UDF sees an argument of length 11.
#
# A similar technique may be needed for other data masking functions when string arguments do
# not have a single-byte character set.
#
# CREATING VIEWS THAT DISPLAY MASKED DATA
#
# If masked data from a table is used for multiple queries, it may be convenient to define a view that
# produces masked data.
#
# That way, applications can select from the view without performing masking in individual queries.
#
# For example, a masking view on the customer table from the previous section can be defined like this:
#
# 		CREATE VIEW masked_customer AS
# 		SELECT id, first_name, last_name, mask_ssn(CONVERT(ssn USING binary)) AS ssn
# 		FROM customer;
#
# Then the query to look up a customer becomes simpler but still returns masked data:
#
# 		SELECT id, ssn
# 		FROM masked_customer
# 		WHERE first_name = 'Joanna' AND last_name = 'Bond';
# 		+----+---------------------+
# 		| id | ssn 						|
# 		+----+---------------------+
# 		|786 | XXX-XX-0007 			|
# 		+----+---------------------+

# MySQL ENTERPRISE DATA MASKING AND DE-IDENTIFICATION USER-DEFINED FUNCTION REFERENCE
#
# The MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification plugin library includes several user-defined
# (UDFs), which may be grouped into these categories:
#
# 		) Data Masking Functions
#
# 		) Random Data Generation Functions
#
# 		) Random Data Dictionary-Based Functions
#
# These UDF's treat string arguments as binary strings, which means they are implicitly case sensitive.
# In addition, string UDF return values are binary strings.
#
# If a string return value should be in a different character set, convert it.
# 
# The following example shows how to convert the result of gen_rnd_email() to the utf8mb4 character set:
#
# 		SET @email = CONVERT(gen_rnd_email() USING utf8mb4);
#
# It may also be necessary to convertt string arguments.
#
# DATA MASKING FUNCTIONS
#
# Each function in this section performs a masking operation on its string argument and returns the masked result.
#
# 		) mask_inner(str, margin1, margin2 [, mask char])
#
# 			Masks the interior part of a string, leaving the ends untouched, and returns the result.
#
# 			An optional masking character can be specified.
#
# 				) Str: The string to mask.
#
# 				) margin1: A nonnegative integer that specifies the number of characters on the left end of the string to remain unmasked.
# 								If 0, no left end chars remain unmasked.
#
# 				) margin2: A nonnegative integer that specifies the number of characters on teh right end of the string to remain unmasked.
# 								If 0, no right end chars remain unmasked.
#
# 				) mask_char: (Optional) The single character to use for masking. The default is 'X', if mask_char is not given.
#
# 								Because UDF string arguments are treated as binary strings, the masking character must be a single-byte character.
# 								Attempts to use a multibyte character produce an error.
#
# Return value:
#
# The masked string or NULL if either margin is negative.
#
# If the sum of the margin values is larger than the argument length, no masking occurs
# and the argument is returned unchanged.
#
# Example:
#
# 		SELECT mask_inner('abcdef', 1, 2), mask_inner('abcdef', 0, 5);
# 		+-----------------------------+------------------------------+
# 		| mask_inner('abcdef', 1, 2) 	| mask_inner('abcdef', 0, 5) 	 |

#
# ) mask_outer(str, margin1, margin2 [, mask char])
#
# 		Masks the left and right ends of a string, leaving the interor unmasked, and returns the result.
# 		An optional masking character can be specified.
#
# 		arguments:
#
# 			) str: The string to mask
#
# 			) margin1: A nonnegative integer that specifies the number of characters on the left end of the string to mask.
# 							If the value is 0, no left end characters are masked.
#
# 			) margin2: A nonnegative integer that specifies the number of characters on the right end of the string to mask.
# 							If the value is 0, no right end chars are masked.
#
# 			) mask_char: (Optional) The single character to use for masking. Default is 'X' if mask_char is not given.
#
# 				Because UDF string arguments are treated as binary strings, the masking character must be a single-byte character.
# 				Attempts to use a multibyte character produce an error.
#
# 	Return value:
#
# 	The masked string, or NULL if either margin is negative.
#
# 	If the sum of the margin values is larger than the argument length, the entire argument is masked.
#
# 	Example:
#
# 		SELECT mask_outer('abcdef', 1, 2), mask_outer('abcdef', 0, 5);

# RANDOM DATA DICTIONARY-BASED FUNCTIONS
#
# The functions in this section manipulate dictionaries of terms and perform generation and masking operations
# based on them.
#
# Some of these functions require the SUPER privilege.
#
# When a dictionary is loaded, it becomes part of the dictionary registry and is assigned a name to be used by other
# dictionary functions.
#
# Dictionaries are loaded from plain text files containing one term per line.
#
# Empty lines are ignored.
#
# To be valid, a dictionary file must contain at least one nonempty line.
#
# ) gen_blacklist(str, dictionary name, replacement dictionary name)
#
# 		Replaces a term present in one dictionary with a term from a second dictionary and returns the replacement term.
#
# 		This masks the original term by substitution.
#
# 		Arguments:
#
# 			) str: A string that indicates the term to replace.
#
# 			) dictionary_name: A string that names the dictionary containing the term to replace.
#
# 			) replacement_dictionary_name: A string that names the dictionary from which to choose the replacement term.
#
# 		Return value:
#
# 		a string randomly chosen from replacement_dictionary_name as a replacement for str, or str if it does not appear in dictionary_name,
# 		or NULL if either dictionary name is not in the dictionary registry.
#
# 		If the term to replace appears in both dictionaries, it is possible for the return value to be the same term.

#
# ) gen_dictionary_drop(dictionary_name)
#
# 		Removes a dictionary from the dictionary registry.
#
# 		This function requires the SUPER privilege.
#
# 		Arguments:
#
# 			) dictionary_name: A string that names the dictionary to remove from the dictionary registry.
#
# 		Return values:
#
# 			a string that indicates whether the drop operation succeeded.
# 			Dictionary removed indicates success.

#
# FIPS SUPPORT
#
# MySQL supports FIPS mode, if compiled using OpenSSL, and an OpenSSL library and FIPS Object Module are available at runtime.
#
# FIPS mode on the server side applies to cryptographic operations performed by the server.
#
# This includes replication (master/slave and Group Replication) and X Plugin,
# which run within the server.
#
# FIPS mode also applies to attempts by clients to connect to the server.
#
# FIPS OVERVIEW
#
# Federal Information Processing Standards 140-2 (FIPS 140-2) describes a security standard
# that can be required by Federal (US Government) agencies for cryptographic modules used
# to protect sensitive or valuable information.
#
# To be considered acceptable for such Federal Use, a cryptographic module must be certified
# for FIPS 140-2.
#
# If a system intended to protect sensitive data lacks the proper FIPS 140-2 certificate, Federal
# agencies cannot purchase it.
#
# Products such as OpenSSL can be used in FIPS mode, although the OpenSSL library itself is not validated
# for FIPS.
#
# Instead, the OpenSSL library is used with the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module to enable OpenSSL based apps to operate in FIPS mode.
#
# IMPORTANT: FIPS mode imposes conditions on cryptographic operations such as restrictions on acceptable encryption
# algorithms or requirements for longer key lengths.
#
# For OpenSSL, the exact FIPS behavior depends on the OpenSSL version. For details, refer to the OpenSSL FIPS user guide.
#
# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR FIPS MODE IN MYSQL
#
# For MySQL to support FIPS mode, these system requirements must be satisfied:
#
# 		) At build time, MySQl must be compiled using OpenSSL. FIPS mode cannot be used in MySQL if compilation uses a different SSL lib.
#
# 		) at runtime, the OpenSSL library and OpenSSL FIPS Object Module must be available as shared (dynamically linked) objects.
# 			It is possible to build statically linked OpenSSL objects, but MysQL will not use them.
#
# FIPS mode has been tested for MySQL on EL7, but may work on other systems.
#
# If your platform or OS provides the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module, you can use it.
#
# Otherwise, you can build the OpenSSL library and FIPS Object MOdule from source.
#
# Use the instructions in the OpenSSL FIPS User Guide (more later)
#
# CONFIGURING FIPS MODE in MySQL
#
# MySQL enables control of FIPS mode on the server side and the client side:
#
# 		) The ssl_fips_mode system variable controls whether the server operates in FIPS mode.
#
# 		) The --ssl-fips-mode client option controls whether a given MySQL client operates in FIPS mode.
#
# The ssl_fips_mode system variable and --ssl-fips-mode client option permit these values:
#
# 		) OFF : Disables FIPS mode.
#
# 		) ON : Enables FIPS mode.
#
# 		) STRICT : Enables "strict" FIPS mode.
#
# On the server side, numeric ssl_fips_mode values of 0, 1, 2 are equivalent to OFF, ON and STRICT.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# 		In general, STRICT imposes more restrictions than ON, But MySQL itself has no FIPS-specific code other than
# 		to specify to OpenSSL the FIPS mode value.
#
# 		The exact behavior of FIPS mode for ON or STRICT depends on the OpenSSL version.
#
# 		For details, refer to the OpenSSL FIPS USer guide.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only permitted value for ssl_fips_mode
# 		and --ssl-fips-mode is OFF.
#
# 		an error occurs for attempts to set the FIPS mode to a different value.
#
# FIPS Mode on the server side applies to cryptographic operations performed by the server.
# This includes replication (master/slave and Group Replication) and X plugin, which run within the server.
#
# FIPS mode also applies to attempts by clients to connect to the server.
#
# WHen enabled, on either the client or server side, it restricts which of the supported encryption
# ciphers can be chosen.
#
# However, enabling FIPS mode does not require that an encrypted connection must be used, or that user
# credentials must be encrypted.
#
# For example, if FIPS mode is enabled, stronger cryptographic algorithms are required.
#
# IN particular, MD5 is restricted, so trying to establish an encrypted connection using an
# encryption cipher such as RC4-MD5 does not work.
#
# But there is nothing about FIPS mode that prevents establishing an uencrypted connection.
#
# (To do that, you can use the REQUIRE clause for CREATE_USER or ALTER_USER for specific user accounts,
# or set the require_secure_transport system variable to affect all accounts).
#
# BACKUP AND RECOVERY
#
# It is important to back up your databases so that you can recover your data and be up and running again in case
# problems occur.
#
# Such as system crashes, hardware failures or users deleting data by mistake.
#
# Backups are also essential as a safeguard before upgrading a MySQL installation, and they can be used to transfer
# a MySQL installation to another system or to set up replication slave servers.
#
# MySQL offers a variety of backup strats from which you can choose the methods that best suti
# the requirements for your installation:
#
# This chapter discusses several backup and recovery topics with which you should be familiar:
#
# 		) Types of Backups -> Logical versus physical, full versus incremental, and so froth.
#
# 		) Methods for creating backups.
#
# 		) Recovery methods, including point-in-time recovery
#
# 		) Backup scheduling, compression and encryption
#
# 		) Table maintenance, to enable recovery of corrupt tables
#
# ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
#
# Resources related to backup or to maintaining data availability include the following:
#
# 		) Customers of MySQL Enterprise Edition can use MysQL Enterprise Backup product for backups.
# 			For an overview of this, see later.
#
# 		) Details for mysqldump can be found earlier.
#
# 		) The syntax of the SQL statements described here is given later.
#
# 		) For additional information about InnoDB backup procedures, see later.
#
# 		) Replication enables you to maintain identical data on multiple servers.
#
# 			This has several benefits, such as eanbling client query load to be distributed
# 			over servers, availability of data even if a given server is taken offline or fails
#
# 			and the ability to make backups with no impact on the master by using a slave server. See more later.
#
# 		) MysQL InnoDB cluster is a collection of products that work together to provide a high availability solution.
#
# 			A group of MySQL servers can be configured to create a cluster using MySQL Shell.
#
# 			The cluster of servers has a single master, called the primary, which acts as the read-write master.
#
# 			Multiple secondary servers are replicas of the master.
#
# 			A minimum of three servers are required to create a high availability cluster.
# 			A client application is connected to the primary via MySQL Router.
#
# 			If the primary fails, a secondary is automatically promoted to the role of primary,
# 			and MySQL Router routes requests to the new primary.
#
# 		) NDB Cluster provides a high-availability, high-redundancy version of MySQL adapted for the distributed
# 			computing environment.
#
# 			See more later.
#
# BACKUP AND RECOVERY TYPES
#
# Physical (RAW) vs. Logical Backups
#
# Physical backups consists of raw copies of the directories and files that store database contents.
#
# This type of backup is suitable for large, important databases that need to be recovered quickly
# when problems occur.
#
# Logical backups save information represented as logical database structure (CREATE_DATABASE, CREATE_TABLE statements)
# and content (INSERT statements or delimited text files).
#
# This type of backup is suitable for smaller amounts of data, where you might edit the values or table structure,
# or recreate the data on a different machine architechture.
#
# Physical backup methods have these characteristics:
#
# 		) The backup consists of exact copies of database directories and files.
#
# 			Typically this is a copy of all or part of the MySQL data directory.
#
# 		) Physical backup methods are faster than logical because they involve only file copying without conversion.
#
# 		) Output is more compact than for logical backup.
#
# 		) Because backup speed and compactness are important for busy, important DBs, The MySQL Enterprise Backup product
# 			performs physical backups.
#
# 			For an overview of the MySQL Enterprise Backup product, see later.
#
# 		) Backup and restore granularity ranges from the level of the entire data directory down to
# 			the level of individual files.
#
# 			This may or may not provide for table-level granularity, depending on storage engine.
#
# 			For example, InnoDB tables can each be in a separate file, or share file storage with other
# 			InnoDB tables; each MyISAM table corresponds uniquely to a set of files.
#
# 		) In addition to Databases, the backup can include any related files such as log or configuration files.
#
# 		) Data from MEMORY tables is tricky to back up this way because their contents are not stored on disk.
# 			(The MySQL Enterprise Backup product has a feature where you can retrieve data from MEMORY tables during a backup)
#
# 		) Backups are portable only to other machines that have identical or similar hardware characteristics.
#
# 		) Backups can be performed while the MySQL server is not running.
#
# 			If the server is running, it is necessary to perform appropriate locking so that the server
# 			does not change DB contents during the backup.
#
# 			MySQL Enterprise Backup does this locking automatically for tables that require it.
#
# 		) Physical backup tools include the mysqlbackup of MySQL Enterprise Backup for InnoDB or any other tables,
# 			or file system-level commands (such as cp, scp, tar, rsync) for MyISAM tables.
#
# 		) For restore:
#
# 			) MySQL Enterprise Backup restores InnoDB and other tables that it backed up.
#
# 			) ndb_restore restores NDB tables.
#
# 			) Files copied at the file system level can be copied back to the original locations with file system commands.
#
# Logical backup methods have these characteristics:
#
# 		) The backup is done by querying the MySQL server to obtain DB structure and content information.
#
# 		) Backup is slower than physical methods because the server must access DB information and convert it to logical format.
# 			If the output is written on the client side, the server must also send it to the backup program.
#
# 		) Output is larger than for physical backup, particularly when saved in text format.
#
# 		) Backup and restore granularity is available at the server level (all databases), database level 
# 			(all taböles in a particular DB), or table level.
#
# 			This is true regardless of storage engine.
#
# 		) The backup does not include log or configuration files, or other database-related files that are not part of databases.
#
# 		) Backups stored in logical format are machine independent and highly portable.
#
# 		) Logical backups are performed with the MySQL server running. The server is not taken offline.
#
# 		) Logical backup tools include the mysqldump program and the SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE statement.
#
# 			These work for any storage engine, even MEMORY.
#
# 		) To restore logical backups, SQL-format dump files can be processed using the mysql client.
#
# 			TO load delimited-text files, use the LOAD_DATA_INFILE statement or the mysqlimport client.
#
# ONLINE VERSUS OFFLINE BACKUPS
#
# Online backups take place while the MySQL is running so that the DB information can be obtained from the server.
# Offline backups tkae place while the server is stopped.
#
# This distinction can also be described as "hot" vs "cold" backups; a "warm" backup is one where the server
# remains running but locked against modifying data while you access database files externally.
#
# Online backup methods have these characteristics:
#
# 		) The backup is less intrusive to other clients, which can connect to the MySQL server during the backup
# 			and may be able to access data depending on what operations they need to perform.
#
# 		) Care must be taken to impose appropriate locking so that data modifications do not take place that would 
# 			compromise backup integrity.
#
# 			The MySQL Enterprise Backup product does such locking automatically.
#
# Offline backup methods have these characteristics:
#
# 		) Clients can be affected adversely because the server is unavailable during backup.
#
# 			For that reason, such backups are often taken from a replication slave server that
# 			can be taken offline without harming availability.
#
# 		) The backup procedure is simpler because there is no possibility of interference from client activity.
#
# A similar distinction between online and offline applies for recovery operations, and similar characteristics apply.
#
# However, it is more likely that clients will be affected for online recovery than for online backup because recovery
# requires stronger locking.
#
# During backup, clients might be able to read data while it is being backed up.
#
# Recovery modifies data and does not just read it, so clients must be prevented from accessing data while it
# is being restored.
#
# LOCAL VERSUS REMOTE BACKUPS
#
# A local backup is performed on the same host where the MySQL server runs, whereas remote backup is
# done from a different host.
#
# For some types of backups, the backup can be initiated from a remote host even if the output is written
# locally on the server host.
#
# 		) mysqldump can connect to local or remote servers. For SQL output (CREATE and INSERT statements),
# 			local or remote dumps can be done and generate output on the client.
#
# 			For delimited text output (with the --tab option), data files are created on the server host.
#
# 		) SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE can be initiated from a local or remote client host, but the output file is created on the server host.
#
# 		) Physical backup methods typically are initiated locally on the MysQL server host so taht the server can be taken offline,
# 			although the destination for copied files might be remote.
# 		
#
# SNAPSHOT BACKUPS
#
# Some file system implementations enable "snapshots" to be taken.
#
# these provide logical copies of the file system at a given point in time, without requiring a physical
# copy of the entire file system.
#
# (For example, the implementation may use copy-on-write techniques so that only parts of the file system modified
# 	after the snapshot time need be copied)
#
# MySQL itself does not provide the capability of taking file system snapshots.
#
# IT is available through third-party solutions suhc as Veritas, LVM or ZFS.
#
# FULL VERSUS INCREMENTAL BACKUPS
#
# A full backup includes all data managed by a MySQL server at a given point in time.
#
# An incremental backup consists of the changes made to the data during a given time
# span (from one time point to another)
#
# Mysql has different ways of performing full backups, such as those described earlier
# in this section.
#
# INcremental backups are made possible by enabling the server's Binary log, which the server
# used to record data changes.
#
# FULL VERSUS POINT IN TIME (INCREMENTAL) RECOVERY
#
# A full recovery restores all data from a full backup.
#
# This restores the server instance to the state that it had when the backup was made.
#
# If that sate is not sufficiently currently, a full recovery can be followed by recovery
# of incremental backups made since the full backup, to bring hte server to a more up-to-date state.
#
# Incremental recovery is recovery of changes made during a given time span.
# This is also called point-in-time recovery, because it makes a server's state current up to
# a given time.
#
# Point in time recovery is based on the binary log and typically follows a full recovery from the
# backup files that restores the server to its state when the backup was made.
#
# Then the data changes written in the binary log files are applied as incremental recovery to redo data
# modifications and bring the server up to the desired point in time.
#
# TABLE MAINTENANCE
#
# Data integrity can be compromised if tables become corrupt.
#
# For InnoDB tables, this is not a typical issue. For programs to check MyISAM
# tables and repair them if problems are found, see earlier.
#
# BACKUP SCHEDULING, COMPRESSION AND ENCRYPTION
#
# Backup scheduling is valuable for automating backup procedures.
#
# Compression of backup output reduces space requirements, and encryption of
# the output provides better security against unauthorized access of backed-up data.
#
# MySQL itself does not provide these capabilities.
#
# The MySQL Enterprise Backup product can compress InnoDB backups,
# and compress or encryption of backup output can be acheived by using file system utilities.
#
# Other third-party solutions may be available.
#
# DATABASE BACKUP METHODS
#
# This section summarizes some general methods for making backups.
#
# MAKING A HOT BACKUP WITH MYSQL ENTERPRISE BACKUP
#
# Customers of MySQL Enterprise Edition can use the MySQL Enterprise Backup product to
# do physical backups of entire instances or selected DBs, tables or both.
#
# This product includes features for incremental and compressed backups.
#
# Backing up the physical database files makes restoring much faster than logical techniques
# such as the mysqldump command.
#
# InnoDB tables are copied using a hot backup mechanism.
#
# (ideally, the InnoDB tables should represent a substansial majority of the data)
#
# Tables from other storage engines are copied using a warm backup mechanism.
#
# More on this later.
#
# MAKING BACKUPS WITH MYSQLDUMP
#
# The mysqldump program can make backups. It can back up all kinds of tables.
#
# For InnoDB tables, it is possible to perform an online backup that takes no locks on tables using the
# --single-transaction option to mysqldump. More on this later.
#
# MAKING BACKUPS BY COPYING TABLE FILES
#
# MyISAM tables can be backed up by copying table files (*.MYD, *MYI files, and associated *.sdi files)
# To get a consistent backup, stop the server or lock and flush the relevant tables:
#
# 		FLUSH TABLES tbl_list WITH READ LOCK;
#
# You need only a read lock; this enables other clients to continue to query the tables while you are making
# a copy of the files in the database directory.
#
# The flush is needed to ensure that all active index pages are written to disk before you start the backup.
# See more on this later.
#
# You can also create a binary backup simply by copying the table files, as long as the server is not updating
# anything.
#
# (But note that hte file copying methods od not work if your DB contains InnoDB tables. Also, even if the server
# is not actively updating data, InnoDB may still have modified data cached in memory and not flushed to disk.)
#
# FOr an example of this backup method, see later.
#
# MAKING DELIMITED-TEXT FILE BACKUPS
#
# To create a text file containing a table's data, you can use SELECT_*_INTO_OUTFILE_'file_name'_FROM_table_name.
#
# The file is created on the MySQL server host, not the client host.
#
# FOr this statement,, the output file cannot already exist, because permitrting files to be overwritten
# constitutes security risks.
#
# This method works for any kind of data file, but saves only the table data, not the table structure.
#
# ANother way to create text data files (along with files containing CREATE_TABLE statements for hte backed up tables)
# is to use mysqldump with the --tab option.
#
# See more on this , later.
#
# To reload a delimited-text data file, use LOAD_DATA_INFILE or mysqlimport
#
# MAKING INCREMENTAL BACKUPS BY ENABLING THE BINARY LOG
#
# MySQL supports incremental backups.
#
# You must start the server with the --log-bin option to enable binary logging.
#
# The binary log files provide you with the information you need to replicate changes to the DB that
# are made subsequent to the point at which you performed a backup.
#
# At the moment you want to make a incremental backup (containing all changes that happened since the last full
# or incremental backup), you should rotate the binary log by using FLUSH_LOGS.
#
# THis done, you need to copy to the backup location all binary logs which range from the one 
# of the moment of the last full or incremental backup to the last one.
#
# These binary logs are the incremental backup; at restore time, you apply them as explained later.
#
# The next time you do a full backup, also rotate the binary log using FLUSH_LOGS or mysqldump --flush-logs
#
# MAKING BACKUPS USING REPLICATION SLAVES
#
# If you have performance problems with your master server while making backups, one strategy that cna help
# is to set up replication and perform backups on the slave rather than on the master.
#
# See more on this later.
#
# IF you are backing up a slave replication server, you should back up its master info and relay log info repositories (more later),
# when you back up the slave's DB, regardless of the backup method you choose.
#
# This information is always needed to resume replication after you restore the slave's data.
#
# If your slave is replicating LOAD_DATA_INFILE statements, you should also back up any SQL_LOAD-*
# files that exist in the directory that the slave uses for this purpose.
#
# The slave needs these files to resume replication of any interuppted LOAD_DATA_INFILE operations.
#
# The location of this directory is the value of the --slave-load-tmpdir option.
#
# IF the server was not started with that option, the directory location is the value of the tmpdir system variable.
#
# RECOVERING CORRUPT TABLES
#
# IF you have to restore MyISAM tables that have become corrupt, try to recover them using
# REPAIR_TABLE or myisamchk -r first.
#
# That should work for the most part.
#
# If it fails, see later.
#
# MAKING BACKUPS USING A FILE SYSTEM SNAPSHOT
#
# If you are using a Veritas file system, you can make a backup like this:
#
# 	1. From a client program, execute FLUSH_TABLES_WITH_READ_LOCK
#
# 	2. From another shell, execute mount vxfs snapshot
#
# 	3. From the first client,, execute UNLOCK_TABLES
#
# 	4. Copy files from the snapshot
#
# 	.5 Unmount the snapshot
#
# Similar snaphot capacities ma yeb avialable in other file systems, such as LVM or ZFS.
#
# EXAMPLE BACKUP AND RECOVERY STRATEGY
#
# This section disscuses a procedure for performing backups taht enables you to recover the data
# after several types of crashes:
#
# 		) Operating System crash
#
# 		) Power failure
#
# 		) File system carsh
#
# 		) Hardware problem (hard drive, motherboard, and so forth)
#
# THe example commands do not include options such as --user and --password for the mysqldump and mysql client programs.
# You should include such options as necessary to enable client programs to connect to the MySQL server.
#
# ASsume that data is stoed in teh InnoDB storage engine, which has support or transactions and automatic crash recovery.
# Assume also that the MySQL is under load at hte time of the crash.
#
# If it were not, no recovery would ever be needed.
#
# FOr cases of operating system crashes or power failures, we can assume that the MySQL disk data is available after a restart.
#
# The INnoDB files might not contain consistent data due to the crash, but InnoDB reads its logs and finds in them
# the list of pending committed and non committed transactions that have not been flushed to the data files.
#
# InnoDB automatically rolls back those transactions that were not committed, and flushes to its data files
# those that were committed.
#
# Information about this recovery process is conveyed to the user through the MySQL error log.
#
# The following is an example log excerpt:
#
# 	InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally.
# 	InnoDB: Starting recovery from log files...
# 	InnoDB: Starting log scan based on checkpoint at
# 	InnoDB: log sequence number 0 13674004
# 	InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13739520
# 	InnoDB: etc.
# 	InnoDB: 1 uncommitted transaction(s) which must be rolled back
# 	InnoDB: Starting rollback of uncommitted transactions
# 	InnoDB: Rolling back trx no 16745
# 	InnoDB: Rolling back of trx no 16745 completed
# 	InnoDB: Rollback of uncomitted transactions completed
# 	InnoDB: Starting an apply batch of log records to the database.
# 	InnoDB: Apply batch completed
# 	InnoDB: Started
# 	mysqld: ready for connections
#
# For the case of file system crashes or hardware problems, we can assume that hte MySQL disk data is NOT available after a restart.
#
# THis means that MySQL fails to start successfully because some blocks of disk data are no longer readable.
#
# IN this case, it is necessary to reformat the disk, install a new one, or otherwise correct the underlying
# problem.
#
# Then it is necessary to recover our MySQL data from backups, which means that backups must
# already have been made.
#
# To make sure that is the case, design and implement a backup policy.
#
# ESTABLISHING A BACKUP POLICY
#
# To be useful, backups must be scheduled regularly.
#
# A full backup (a snapshot of the data at a point in time) can be done in MySQL with several tools.
#
# For example, MySQL Enterprise Backup can perform a physical backup of an entire instance, with optimizations
# to minimize overhead and avoid disruption when backing up InnoDB data files:
# 
# mysqldump provides online logical backups. THis discussion uses mysqldump.
#
# Assume that we make a full backup of all our InnoDB tables in all databases using the following
# command on Sundat at 1 p.m., when load is low:
#
# 		mysqldump --all-databases --master-data --single-transactions > backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
#
# The resulting .sql file produced by mysqldump contains a set of SQL INSERT statements that can be used 
# to reload the dumped tables at a later time.
#
# THis backup operation acquires a global read lock on all tables at the beginning of the dump
# (using FLUSH_TABLES_WITH_READ_LOCK).
#
# As soon as this lock has been acquired, the binary log coordinates are read and the lock is released.
#
# If long updating statements are running when the FLUSH statement is issued, the backup operation
# may stall until those statements finish.
#
# After that, the dump becomes lock-free and does not disturb reads and writes on the tables.
#
# It was assumed earliar the the tables to back up are InnoDB tables, so --single-transaction uses
# a consistent read and guarantees that data seen by mysqldump does not change.
#
# (Changes made by other clients to InnoDB tables are not seen by the mysqldump process)
#
# If the backup operation includes nontransactional tables, consistency requires that htey do not
# change during the backup.
#
# For example, for the MyISAM tables in the mysql database, there must be no administrative changes to
# MySQL accounts during the backup.
#
# Full backups are necessary, but it is not always convenient to create them.
# They produce large backup files and take time to generate.
#
# They are not optimal in the sense that each successive full backup includes all data, even that
# part that has not changed since the previous full backup.
#
# IT is more efficient to make an initial full backup and then to make incremental backups.
#
# The incremental backups are smaller and take less time to produce.
# The tradeoff is that, at recovery time, you cannot restore your data just by reloading the full backup.
#
# You must also process the incremental backups to recover the incremental changes.
#
# TO make incremental backups, we need to save the incremental changes.
#
# In MySQL, these changes are represented in the binary log, so the MySQL server should always be
# started with the --log-bin option to enable that log.
#
# With binary logging enabled, teh server writes the data change into a file while it updates data.
#
# Looking at hte data directory of a MySQL server that was started with the --log-bin option and
# that has been running for some days, we find these MySQL binary log files:
#
# -rw-rw---- 1 guilhem guilhem  	1277324 Nov 10 23:59 gbichot2-bin.000001
# -rw-rw---- 1 guilhem guilhem 			4 Nov 10 23:59 gbichot2-bin.000002
# |
# V etc, until last is Index
#
# 
# Each time it restarts, the MySQL server creates a new binary log file using the next number
# in the sequence.
#
# While the server is running, you can also tell it to close the current binary log file
# and begin a new one manually by issuing a FLUSH_LOGS SQL statement or with a mysqladmin flush-logs command.
#
# Mysqldump also has an option to flush the logs.
#
# The .index file in the data directory contains the list of all MySQL binary logs in the directory.
#
# The MySQL binary logs are important for recovery because they form the set of incremental backups.
#
# If you make sure to flush the logs when you make your full backup, the binary log files created
# afterwards contain all the data changes made since the backup.
#
# Let's modify the previous mysqldump command a bit so that it flushes the MySQL binary logs
# at the moment of the full backup, and so that the dump file contains the name of the
# new current binary log:
#
# mysqldump --single-transaction --flush-logs --master-data=2 \
#  --all-databases > backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
#
# After executing this command, the data directory contains a new binary log file,
# gbichot2-bin.000007,, because the --flush-logs option causes the server to flush its
# logs.
#
# The --master-data option causes mysqldump to write binary log information to its output,
# so the resulting .sql dump file includes these lines:
#
# 	-- Position to start replication or point-in-time recovery from
# 	-- CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='gbichot2-bin.000007',MASTER_LOG_POS=4;
#
# Because the MySQldump command made a full backup, those lines mean two things:
#
#		) The dump file contains all changes made before nay changes written to the gbichot2-bin.000007 binary log file or higher
#
#	 	) All data changes logged after the backup are not present in the dump file, but are present in the gbichot2-bin.000007 binary log file or higher.
#
# On Monday at 1 p.m, we can create an incremental backup by flushing the logs to begin a new binary log file.
#
# For example, executing a mysqladmin flush-logs command creates gbichot2-bin.000008 
#
# All changes between the Sunday 1 p.m full backup and Monday 1 p.m will be in the gbichot2-bin.000007 file.
#
# This incremental backup is important ,so it is a good idea to copyt it to a safe place.
#
# (For example, back it up on tape or DVD, or copy it to another machine).
#
# On Tuesday 1 p.m, excute another mysqladmin flush-logs command.
#
# all Changes between the Monday 1 p.m and Tuesday 1 p.m, will be in teh gbicht2-bin.000008 file
# (which also should be copied somewhere safe)
#
# THe MySQL binary logs take up disk space. To free up space, purge them from time ot time.
#
# One way to do this is by deleting the binary logs that are no longer needed, such as when
# we make a full backup:
#
# 		mysqldump --single-transaction --flush-logs --master-data=2 \
# 			--all-databases --delete-master-logs > backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Deleting the MYSQL binary logs with mysqldump --delete-master-logs can be dangerous if your server is
# 		a replication master server, because slave servers might not fully have processed the contents
# 		of the binary log.
#
# 		The description for the PURGE_BINARY_LOGS statement explains what hsould be verified before deleting
# 		the MySQL binary logs.
#
# More on purging binary logs later.
#
# USING BACKUPS FOR RECOVERY
#
# Now suppose that we have a catastrophic crash on Wednesday at 8 a.m, taht requires recovery from backups.
#
# TO recover, first we restore the last full backup we have (the one from Sunday 1 p.m.)
#
# The full backup file is just a set of SQL statements, so restoring it is very easy:
#
# 		mysql < backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
#
# At this point, the data is restored to its state as of Sunday 1 p.m..
#
# TO restore the changes made since then, we must use incremental backups.
#
# That is, the gbichot2-bin.000007 and gbichot2-bin.000008 binary log files.
#
# Fetch the files if neceesary from where you ahve them, and then process their contents as follows:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog gbichot2-bin.000007 gbichot2-bin.000008 | mysql
#
# We now have recover the data to its state as of Tuesday 1 p.m, but still are missing teh changes
# from that date to the date of the crash.
#
# To not lose them, we would have needed to have the MySQL server store its MySQL binary logs
# into a safe location (RAID disks, SAN, etc.) different from the place where it stores its data files,
# so taht htese logs were not on the destroyed disk.
#
# (That is, we can start the server with a --log-bin option that specifies a location on a different
# physical device from the one on which the data directory resides.
#
# That way, the logs are safe even if the device contianing the directory is lost)
#
# If we had done this, we would have the gbichot2-bin.000009 file (and any subsequent files) at hand,
# and we could apply them using mysqlbinlog and mysql to restore the most recent data changes with no
# loss up to hte moment of the crash:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog gbichot-bin.0000009 ... | mysql
#
# For more information about mysqlbinlog to process binary log files, see later.
#
# BACKUP STRATEGY SUMMARY
#
# IN case of an operating system crash or power fialure, InnoDB does all the job of recovering the data.
# but to make sure that you can sleep well, observe the following guidelines:
#
# 		) Always run the MySQL server with the --log-bin option, or even --log-bin=log_name, where the log file name
# 			is located on some safe media different from the drive on which the data directory is located.
#
# 			If you have such safe media, this technique can also be good for disk load balancing (which results in a performaance improvement)
#
# 		) Make periodic full backups, using the mysqldump command shown earlier, that makes an online, nonblocking backup.
#
# 		) Make periodic incremental backups by flushing the logs with FLUSH_LOGS or mysqladmin flush-logs
#
# USING MYSQLDUMP FOR BACKUPS
#
# This section describes how to use mysqldump to produce dump files, and how to reload dump files.
# A dump file can be used in several ways:
#
# 	) As a backup to enable data recovery in case of data loss.
#
# 	) As a source of data for setting up replication slaves
#
# 	) As a source of data for experimentation:
#
# 		) To make a copy of a database that you can use without changing the original data.
#
# 		) TO test potentional upgrade incompatibilities
#
# mysqldump produces two types of output, depending on whether the --tab option is given:
#
# 	) Without --tab, mysqldump writes SQL statements to the standard output.
#
# 		This output consists of CREATE statements to create dumped objects (databases, tables, stored routines,
# 		and so forth) and INSERT statements to load data into tables.
#
# 		The output can be saved in a file and reloaded later using mysql to recreate the dumped objects.
#
# 		Options are available to modify the format of the SQL statements, and to control which objects are dumped.
#
# 	) With --tab, mysqldump produces two output files for each dumped table.
#
# 		The server writes one file as tab-delimited text, one line per table row.
# 		This file is named tbl_name.txt in the output directory.
#
# 		The server also sends a CREATE_TABLE statement for the table to mysqldump, which writes
# 		it as a file named tbl_name.sql in the output directory.
#
# DUMPING DATA IN SQL FORMAT WITH MYSQLDUMP
#
# This section describes how ot use mysqldump to create SQL-format dump files.
#
# For information about reloading such dump files, see later.
#
# By default, mysqldump writes information as SQL statements to the standard output.
# You can save the output in a file:
#
# 		mysqldump [arguments] > file_name
#
# TO dump all databases, invoke mysqldump with the --all-databases option:
#
# 		mysqldump --all-databases > dump.sql
#
# To dump only specific databases, name them on teh command line and use the --databases option:
#
# 		mysqldump --databases db1 db2 db3 > dump.sql
#
# The --databases option causes all names on the cmd line to be treated as DB names.
# WIthout htis option, mysqldump treats the first name as a DB name and the following as table names.
#
# WIth --all-databases or --databases, mysqldump writes CREATE_DATABASE and USE statements prior ot hte dump
# output for each databse.
#
# This ensures that when the dump file is reloaded, it creates each database if it does not exist and makes it hte default DB,
# so DB contents are loaded into the same database from which they came.
#
# If you want to cause the dump file to force a drop of each database before recreating it, use the --add-drop-database option
# as well.
#
# IN this scase, mysqldump writes a DROP_DATABASE statement preceding to the CREATE_DATABASE statement.
#
# To dump a single database, name it on teh command line:
#
# mysqldump --databases test > dump.sql
#
# In the single-database case, it is permissible to omit the --databases option:
#
# 		mysqldump test > dump.sql
#
# The difference between the two preceding commands is that without --databases, the dump output
# contains no CREATE_DATABASE or USE statements.
#
# This has several implications:
#
# 	) WHen you reload the dump file, you must specify a default DB name so that the server knows which DB to reload
#
# 	) For reloading, you can specify a DB name different from the original name, which enables you to reload the data
# 		into a different DB.
#
# 	) If the database to be reloade does not exist, you must create it first.
#
# 	) Because the output will contain no CREATE_DATABASE statement, the --add-drop-database option has no effect.
# 		If you use it, it produces no DROP_DATABASE statement.
#
# To dump only specific tables from a database, name them on the command line following the DB name:
#
# 		mysqldump test t1 t3 t7 > dump.sql
#
# RELOADING SQL-FORMAT BACKUPS
#
# To reload a dump file written by mysqldump that consists of SQL statements, use it as input to the mysql client.
#
# If the dump file was created by mysqldump with the --all-databases, or --databases option, it contains
# CREATE_DATABASE and USE statements and it is not necessary to specify a Default DB into which to load the data:
#
# 		mysql < dump.sql
#
# Alternatively, from within mysql, ,use a source command:
#
# 		source dump.sql
#
# If the file is a single-database dump not containing CREATE_DATABASE and USE statements, create the database first (if necessary):
#
# 		mysqladmin create  db1
#
# Then specify the database name when you load the dump file:
#
# 		mysql db1 < dump.sql
#
# Alternatively, from within mysql, create the database, select it as the default database, and load the dump file:
#
# 		CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db1;
# 		USE db1;
# 		source dump.sql
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		For Windows Powershell users: Because the "<" char is reserved for future use in PowerHSelll, an alternative paproach is
# 		required, such as using quotes cmd.exe /c "mysql < dump.sql"
#
# DUMPING DATA IN DELIMIETED-TEXT FORMAT WITH MYSQLDUMP
#
# This section describes how to use mysqldump to create delimieted-text dump files.
# For information about reloading such dump files, see later.
#
# If you invoke mysqldump with the --tab=dir_name option, it uses dir_name as the output directory
# and dumps tables individually in that directory using two files for each table.
#
# The table name is the base name for these files. FOr a table named t1, the files are named t1.sql and t1.txt 
#
# The .sql file contains a CREATE TABLE statement for the table.
#
# The .txt file contains the table data, one line per table row
#
# The following command dumps the contents of the db1 database to files in the /tmp database:
#
# mysqldump --tab=/tmp db1
#
# The .txt files containing table data are written by the server, so they are owned by the system account used
# for running the server.
#
# The server uses SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE to write the files, so you must have the FILE privilege to perform this operation,
# and an error occurs if a given .txt file already exists.
#
# The server sends the CREATE definitions for dumped tables to mysqldump, which writes them to .sql files.
# These files therefore are owned by the user who executes mysqldump.
#
# It is best that --tab be used only for dumping a local server.
#
# If you use it with a remote server, the --tab directory must exist on both the local and remote hosts, and the
# .txt files will be written by the server in teh remote directory (on the server host), whereas the .sql files
# will be written by mysqldump in the local directory (on the client host).
#
# For mysqldump --tab, the server by default writes table data to .txt files one line per row with tabs between
# column values, no quotation marks around column values, and newlines as the line terminator.
#
# (These are the same defaults as for SELECT_..._INTO_OUTFILE)
#
# To enable data files to be written using a different format, mysqldump supports these options:
#
# 		) --fields-terminated-by=str
#
# 				The string for separating column values (default: tab)
#
# 		) --fields-enclosed-by=char
#
# 				The character within which to enclose column values (default: no character)
#
# 		) --fields-optionally-enclosed-by=char
#
# 				The character within which to enclose non-numeric column values (default: no character)
#
# 		) --fields-escaped-by=char
#
# 				The character for escaping special characters (default: no escaping)
#
# 		) --lines-terminated-by=str
#
# 				The line-termination string (default: newline)
#
# Depending on the value you specify for any of these options, it might be necessary on the command
# line to quote or escape the value appropriately for your command interpreter.
#
# Alternatively, specify the value using hex notation. Suppose that you want mysqldump to quote
# column values within double quotation marks.
#
# To do so, specify double quote as the value for the --fields-enclosed-by option.
#
# But this character is often special to command interpreters and msut be treated specially.
# 
# For example, on Unix, you must quote the quote notation:
#
# 		--fields-enclosed-by='"'
#
# Or, you can define it in hexadecimal
#
# 		--fields-enclosed-by=0x22
#
# It is common to use several of the data-formatting options together.
# For example, to dump tables in comma-separated values format with lines terminated by carriage return
# /newline pairs (\r\n), use this command on a single line:
#
# 		mysqldump --tab=/tmp --fields-terminated-by=, --fields-enclosed-by='"' --lines-terminated-by=0x0d0a db1
#
# Should you use any of the data-formatting options to dump table data, you will need to specify the same
# format when you reload data files later, to ensure proper interpretaion of the file contents.
#
# RELOADING DELIMITED-TEXT FORMAT BACKUPS
#
# For backups produced with mysqldump --tab, each table is represented in the output directory by an .sql file
# containing the CREATE_TABLE statement for the table, and a .txt file containing the table data.
#
# To reload a table, first change location into the output directory. Then process the .sql file with
# mysql to create an empty table and process the .txt file to load the data into the table:
#
# 		mysql db1 < t1.sql
# 		mysqlimport db1 t1.txt
#
# An alternetive to using mysqlimport to load the data file is to use the LOAD_DATA_INFILE statement
# from within the mysql client:
#
# 		USE db1;
# 		LOAD DATA INFILE 't1.txt' INTO TABLE t1;
#
# If you used any data-formatting options with mysqldump when you initially dumped the table,
# you must use the same options with mysqlimport or LOAD_DATA_INFILE to ensure proper interpretation
# of the data file contents:
#
# mysqlimport --fields-terminated-by=, --fields-enclosed-by="'" --lines-terminated-by=0x0d0a db1 t1.txt
#
# OR
#
# USE db1;
# LOAD DATA INFILE 't1.txt' INTO TABLE t1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
# FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';
#
# MYSQLDUMP TIPS
#
# This section surveys techniques that enable you to use mysqldump to solve specific problems:
#
# 		) How to make a copy of a Database
#
# 		) How to copy a database from one server to another
#
# 		) How to dump stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers and events)
#
# 		) How to dump definitions and data separately 
#
# MAKING A COPY OF A DATABASE
#
# mysqldump db1 > dump.sql
# mysqladmin create db2
# mysql db2 < dump.sql
#
# Do not use --databases on the mysqldump command line because that causes USE db1 to be included in the dump file,
# which overrides the effect of naming db2 on the mysql command line.
#
# COPY A DATABASE FROM ONE SERVER TO ANOTHER
#
# On Server 1:
#
# 		mysqldump --databases db1 > dump.sql
#
# Copy the dump file from Server 1 to Server 2.
#
# On Server 2:
#
# 		mysql < dump.sql
#
# Use of --databases with the mysqldump command line causes the dump file to include CREATE_DATABASE
# and USE statements that create the database if it does exist and make it the default database for
# the reloaded data.
#
# Alternatively, you can omit --databases from the mysqldump command.
#
# Then you will need to create the database on server 2 (if necessary) and specify it
# as the default database when you reload the dump file.
#
# On Server 1:
#
# 		mysqldump db1 > dump.sql
#
# On Server 2:
#
# 		mysqladmin create db1
# 		mysql db1 < dump.sql
#
# You can specify a different database name in this case, so omitting --databases from the mysqldump
# command enables you to dump data from one database and load it into another.
#
# DUMPING STORED PROGRAMS
#
# Several options control how mysqldump handles stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers and events):
#
# 		) --events: Dump Event Scheduler events
#
# 		) --routines: Dump stored procedures and functions
#
# 		) --triggers: Dump triggers for tables
#
# The --triggers option is enabled by default so that when tables are dumped, they are accompanied
# by any triggers they have.
#
# The other options are disabled by default and must be specified explicitly to dump the corresponding objects.
#
# To disable any of these options explicitly, use its skip form: --skip-events, --skip-routines or --skip-triggers.
#
# DUMPING TABLE DEFINITIONS AND CONTENT SEPARATELY
#
# The --no-data option tells mysqldump not to dump table data, resulting in the udmp file containg only statements
# to create the tables.
#
# Conversely, teh --no-create-info option tells mysqldump to suppress CREATE statements from the output, so that
# the dump file contains only table data.
#
# For example, to dump table definitions and data separately for the test database, use these commands:
#
# 		mysqldump --no-data test > dump-defs.sql
# 		mysqldump --no-create-info test > dump-data.sql
#
# For a definition-only dump, add the --routines and --events options to also include stored routine and event definitions:
#
# 		mysqldump --no-data --routines --events test > dump-defs.sql
#
# USING MYSQLDUMP TO TEST FOR UPGRADE INCOMPATIBILITIES
#
# When contemplating a MySQL upgrade, it is prudent to install the newer version separately from your current product version.
#
# Then you can dump the database and database object definitions from the production server and load them into
# the new server to verify that they are handled proeprly.
#
# (This is also useful for testing downgrades)
#
# On the production server:
#
# 		mysqldump --all-databases --no-data --routines --events > dump-defs.sql
#
# On the upgraded server:
#
# 		mysql < dump-defs.sql
#
# Because the dump file does not contain table data, it can be processed quickly.
#
# This enables you to spot potentional incompatibilities without waiting for lengthy
# data-loading operations.
#
# Look for warnings or errors while the dump file is being processed.
#
# After you have verified that the definitions are handled properly, dump the data 
# and try to load it into the upgraded server.
#
# On the production server:
#
# 		mysqldump --all-databases --no-create-info > dump-data.sql
#
# On the upgraded server:
#
# mysql < dump-data.sql
#
# Now check the table contents and run some test queries.
#
# POINT-IN-TIME (INCREMENTAL) RECOVERY USING THE BINARY LOG
#
# Point-in-time recovery refers to recovery of data changes made since a given point in time.
#
# Typically, this type of recovery is performed after restoring a full backup that brings
# the server to its state as of the time that the backup was made.
#
# (The full backup can be made in several ways, such as those listed earlier)
#
# Point-in-time recovery then brings the server up to date incrementally from the time of the
# full backup to a more recent time.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Many of the examples here use the mysql client to process binary log output produced by mysqlbinlog.
#
# 		If your binary log contains \0 (null) characters, that output cannot be parsed by mysql unless you
# 		invoke it with the --binary-mode option. 
#
# Point-in-time recovery is based on these principles:
#
# 		) The source of information for point-in-time recovery is the set of incremental backups represented
# 			by the binary log files generated subsequent to the full backup operaiton.
#
# 			Therefore, the server must be started with the --log-bin option to enable binary logging
#
# 			To restore data from the binary log, you must know the name and location of the current binary log files.
#
# 			By default, the server creates binary log files in the data directory, but a path name can be
# 			specified with the --log-bin option to place the files in a different location.  		
# 
#  		To see a listing of all binary log files, use this statement:
#
# 				SHOW BINARY LOGS;
#
# 			To determine the name of the current binary log file, issue the following statement:
#
# 				SHOW MASTER STATUS;
#
# 		) The mysqlbinlog utility converts the events in the binary log files from binary format to text so that they can be
# 			executed or viewed.
#
# 			mysqlbinlog has options for selecting sections of the binary log based on event times or position of events within the log.
#
# 		) Executing events from the binary log causes the data modifications they represent to be redone.
#
# 			This enables recovery of data changes for a given span of time.
#  		To execute events from the binary log, process mysqlbinlog output using the mysql client:
#
# 			mysqlbinlog binlog_files | mysql -u root -p
#
# 		) Viewing log contents can be useful when you need to determine event times or positions to select partial
# 			log contents prior to executing events.
#
# 			To view events from the log, send mysqlbinlog output into a paging program:
#
# 			mysqlbinlog binlog_files | more
#
# 			Alternatively, save the output in a file and view the file in a text editor:
#
# 			mysqlbinlog binlog_files > tmpfile
# 			--- edit tmpfile ---
#
# 		) Saving the output in a file is useful as a preliminary to executing the log contents with certain events
# 			removed, such as an accidental DROP_DATABASE.
#
# 			You can delete from the file any statements not to be executed before executing its contents.
# 			After editing the file, execute the contents as follows:
#
# 				mysql -u root -p < tmpfile
#
# If you have more than one binary log to execute on the MySQL server, the safe method is to process them all
# using a single connection to the server.
#
# Here is an example that demonstrates what may be unsafe:
#
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 | mysql -u root -p # dangerous to write to 2 separate connections
# mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p # ^
#
# Processing binary logs this way using different connections to the server causes problems if the first
# log file contains a CREATE_TEMPORARY_TABLE statement and the second log contains a statement that uses the
# temporary table.
#
# When the first connection terminates, the server drops the temporary table.
#
# WHen the second mysql process attempts to access it, it will be attempting to referencing a unknown table.
#
# To avoid problems like this, use a single ceonnection to execute the contents of all binary logs that you want
# to process.
#
# Here is one way to do so:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p
#
# Another approach is to write all the logs to a single file and then process the file:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 > /tmp/statements.sql
# 		mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 >> /tmp/statements.sql
# 		mysql -u root -p -e "source /tmp/statements.sql"
#
# When writing to a dump file while reading back from a binary log containing GTIDS (more later on global transaction identifiers),
# use the --skip-gtids option with mysqlbinlog like this:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog --skip-gtids binlog.000001 > /tmp/dump.sql
# 		mysqlbinlog --skip-gtids binlog.000002 >> /tmp/dump.sql
# 		mysql -u root -p -e "source /tmp/dump.sql"
#
# POINT IN TIME RECOVERY USING EVENT TIMES
#
# To indicate the start and end times for recovery, specify the --start-datetime and --stop-datetime options
# for mysqlbinlog, in DATETIME format.
#
# As an example, suppose that exactly at 10:00 a.m on April 20, 2005 - a SQL statement was executed that deleted
# a large table.
#
# To restore the table and data, you could restore the previous nights backup, and then execute the following command:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog --stop-datetime="2005-04-20 9:59:59" \
# 			/var/log/mysql/bin.123456 | mysql -u root -p
#
# This command recovers all of the data up until the date and time given by the --stop-datetime option.
#
# If you did not detect the errorneous SQL statement that was entered until hours later,
# you will probably also want to recover the activity that occured afterwards.
#
# Based on this, you could run mysqlbinlog again with a start date and time, like so:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="2005-04-20 10:01:00" \
# 			/var/log/mysql/bin.123456 | mysql -u root -p
#
# In this command, the SQL statements logged from 10:01 a.m. on will be re-executed.
#
# The combination of restoring the previous night's dump file and the two mysqlbinlog
# commands, restore everything up until one second before 10:00 a.m, and everything from 10:01 a.m on.
#
# To use this method of point-in-time recovery, you should examine the log to be sure of the exact
# times to specify for the commands.
#
# To display the log file contents without executing them, use this command:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog /var/log/mysql/bin.123456 > /tmp/mysql_restore.sql
#
# Then open the /tmp/mysql_restore.sql file with a text editor to examine it.
#
# Excluding specific changes by specifying times for mysqlbinlog does not work well if multiple
# statements executed at the same time as the one to be excluded.
#
# POINT-IN-TIME RECOVERY USING EVENT POSITIONS
#
# Instead of specifying dates and times, the --start-position and --stop-position options for mysqlbinlog
# can be used for specifying log positions.
#
# They work the same as the start and stop date options, except that you specify log position numbers rather
# than dates.
#
# Using positions may enable you to be more precise about which part of the log to recover, especially if many
# transactions occurred around the same time as a damaging SQL statement.
#
# To determine the position numbers, run mysqlbinlog for a range of times near the time when the unwanted
# transaction was executed, but redirect the results to a text file for examination.
#
# This can be done like so:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="2005-04-20 9:55:00" \
# 			--stop-datetime="2005-04-20 10:05:00" \
# 			/var/log/mysql/bin.123456 > /tmp/mysql_restore.sql
#
# This command creates a small text file in the /tmp directory that contains the SQL statements
# around the time that the deleterious SQL statement was executed.
#
# Open this file with a text editor and look for the statement that you do not want to repeat.
#
# Determine the positions in the binary log for stopping and resuming the recovery and make
# note of them.
#
# Positions are labeled as log_pos followed by a number.
#
# After restoring the previous backup file, use the position number to process the binary log file.
# For example, you would use commands something like these:
#
# 		mysqlbinlog --stop-position=368312 /var/log/mysql/bin.123456 \
# 			| mysql -u root -p
#		mysqlbinlog --start-position=368315 /var/log/mysql/bin.123456 \
# 			| mysql -u root -p
#
# The first command recovers all the transactions up until the stop position given.
#
# The second command recovers all transactions from the starting position given until the
# end of the binary log.
#
# Because the output of mysqlbinlog includes SET TIMESTAMP statements before each SQL statement recorded,
# the recovered data and related MySQL logs will reflect the original times at which the transactions
# were executed.
#
# MyISAM TABLE MAINTENANCE AND CRASH RECOVERY
#
# This section discusses how to use myisamchk to check or repair MyISAM tables (tables that have .MYD and .MYI files for
# storing data and indexes)
#
# For general myisamchk background, see earlier.
#
# Other table-repair information can be found earlier.
#
# You can use myisamchk to check, repair or optimize database tables.
#
# The following sections describes how to perform these operations and how to set up a table
# maintenance schedule.
#
# For information about using myisamchk to get information about your tables, see earlier.
#
# Even though table repair with myisamchk is quite secure, it is always a good idea to make a backup
# before doing a repair or any maintenance operation that could make a lot of changes to a table.
#
# myisamchk operations that affect indexes can cause MyISAM FULLTEXT indexes to be rebuilt with
# full-text parameters that are incompatible with the values used by the MySQL server.
#
# To avoid this problem, see earlier.
#
# MyISAM table maintenance can also be done using the SQL statements that perform operations
# similar to what myisamchk can do:
#
# 		) To check MyISAM tables, use CHECK_TABLE
#
# 		) To repair MyISAM tables, use REPAIR_TABLE
#
# 		) To optimize MyISAM tables, use OPTIMIZE_TABLE
#
# 		) To analyze MyISAM tables, use ANALYZE_TABLE
#
# For additional information about these statements, see later.
#
# These statements can be used directly or by means of the mysqlcheck client program.
#
# One advantage of these statements over myisamchk is that the server does all the work.
#
# With myisamchk, you must make sure that the server does not use the tables at the same time
# so that there is no unwanted interaction between myisamchk and the server.
#
# USING MYISAMCHK FOR CRASH RECOVERY
#
# This section describes how to check for and deal with data corruption in MySQL databases.
# If your tables become corrupted frequently, you should try to find the reason why. 
#
# For an explonation of how MyISAM tables can become corrupted, see later.
#
# If you run mysqld with external locking disabled (which is the default), you cannot reliably use 
# myisamchk to check a table when mysqld is using the same table.
#
# If you can be certain that no one will access the tables through mysqld while you run
# myisamchk, you only have to execute mysqladmin flush-tables before you start checking the tables.
#
# If you cannot guarantee this, you must stop mysqld while you check the tables.
#
# If you run myisamchk to check tables that mysqld is updating at the same time,
# you may get a warning that a table is corrupt even when it is not.
#
# If the server is run with external locking enabled, you can use myisamchk to check tables at any time.
#
# IN this case, if the server tries to update a table that myisamchk is using, the server will wait 
# for myisamchk to finish before it continues.
#
# If you use myisamchk to repair or optimize tables, you must always ensure that the mysqld server is
# not using the table (this also applies if external locking is disabled).
#
# If you do not stop mysqld, you should at least do a mysqladmin flush-tables before you run myisamchk.
# Your tables may become corrupted if the server and myisamchk access the tables simultaneously.
#
# When performing a crash recovery, it is important to understand that each MyISAM table tbl_name in
# a database corresponds to the three files in the database directory shown in teh following table.
#
# FIle 					Purpose
#
# tbl_name.MYD 		Data file
# tbl_name.MYI 		index file
#
# Each of these three file types is subject to corruption in various ways, but problems occur most often
# in data files and index files.
#
# myisamchk works by creating a copy of the .MYD data file row by row.
#
# It ends the repair stage by removing the old .MYD file and renaming the new file to the original file
# name.
#
# If you use --quick, myisamchk does not create a temporary .MYD file, but instead assumes that the .MYD file
# is correct and generates only a new index file without touching the .MYD file.
#
# This is safe, because myisamchk automatically detects whether the .MYD file is corrupt and aborts the repair
# if it is.
#
# You can also specify the --quick option twice to myisamchk.
#
# In this case, myisamchk does not abort on some errors (such as duplicate-key errors) but instead
# tries to resolve them by modifying the .MYD file.
#
# Normally, the use of two --quick options is useful only if you have too little free disk space to perform
# a normal repair.
#
# In this case, you should at least make a backup of the table before running myisamchk.
#
# HOW TO CHECK MYISAM TABLES FOR ERRORS
#
# To check a MyISAM table, use the following commands:
#
# 	) myisamchk tbl_name
#
# 		This finds most errors. What it cannot find is corruption that involves ONLY the data file (unusual).
# 		If you want to check a table, you should normally run myisamchk without options or with the -s (silent) option.
#
# 	) myisamchk -m tbl_name
#
# 		This finds most errors. First checks all index entries for errors and then reads through all rows.
#
# 		It calculates a checksum for all key values in the rows and verifies that the checksum matches
# 		the checksum for the keys in the index tree.
#
# 	) myisamchk -e tbl_name
#
# 		This does a complete and throrough check of all data (-e means "extended").
#
# 		It does a check-read of every key for each row to verify that they indeed point to the
# 		correct row.
#
# 		This may take a long time for a large table that has many indexes.
#
# 		Normally, myisamchk stops after the first error it finds.
#
# 		If you want to obtain more information, add the -v (verbose) option. This causes myisamchk to keep going, up to a max of 20 errors.
#
# 	) myisamchk -e -i tbl_name
#
# 		Like extensive, but the -i is to print additional statistical information.
#
# In most cases, a simple myisamchk command with no arguments other than the table name is sufficient
# to check a table.
#
# HOW TO REPAIR MYISAM TABLES
#
# The discussion in this section describes how to use myisamchk on MyISAM tables (extensions .MYI and .MYD)
#
# You can also use the CHECK_TABLE and REPAIR_TABLE statements to check and repair MyISAM tables.
# See later for more info.
#
# Symptoms of corrupted tables include queries that abort unexpectedly and observable errors such as these:
#
# 		) Can't find file tbl_name.MYI (Errorcode: nnn)
#
# 		) unexpected end of file
#
# 		) Record file is crashed
#
# 		) Got error nnn from table handler
#
# To get more information about the error, run perror nnn, where nnn is the error number.
#
# The following example shows how to use perror to find the meanings for the most common error
# numbers that indicate a problem with a table:
#
# 		perror 126 127 132 134 135 136 141 144 145
# 		MySQL error code 126 = Index file is crashed
# 		MySQL error code 127 = record-file is crashed
# 		MySQL error code 132 = Old database file
# 		MySQL error code 134 = Record was already deleted (or record file crashed)
#
# 		MySQL error code 135 = No more room in record file
# 		MySQL error code 136 = No more room in index file
# 		MySQL error code 141 = Duplicate unique key or constraint on write or update
# 		MySQL error code 144 = Table is crashed and last repair failed
# 		MySQL error code 145 = Table was marked as crashed and should be repaired
#
# Note that error 135 (no more room in record file) and error 136 (no more room in index file) are not errors
# that can be fixed by a simple repair.
#
# In this case, you must use ALTER_TABLE to increase the MAX_ROWS and AVG_ROW_LENGTH table option values:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE tbl_name MAX_ROWS=xxx AVG_ROW_LENGTH=yyy;
#
# If you do not know the current table option values, use SHOW_CREATE_TABLE.
#
# For the other errors, you must repair your tables. myisamchk can usually detect and fix most problems
# that occur.
#
# The repair process involves up to three stages, described here.
#
# Before you begin, you should change location to the database directory and check the permissions
# of the table files.
#
# On Unix, make sure that they are readable by the user that mysqld runs as (and to you, because you need
# to access the files you are checking).
#
# If it turns out you need to modify files, they must also be writable by you.
#
# This section is for cases where a table check fails (such as those described earlier), or you want
# to use the extended features that myisamchk provides.
#
# The myisamchk options used for table maintenance are described earlier.
#
# Note that when you do mysqladmin shutdown on a remote server, the mysqld server is still available
# for a while after mysqladmin returns, until all statement-processing has stopped and all index
# changes have been flushed to disk.
#
# STAGE 1: Checking your tables
#
# Run myisamchk *.MYI or myisamchk -e *.MYI if you have more time. Use the -s (silent) option to suppress uncalled for information.
#
# If the mysqld server is stopped, you should use the --update-state option to tell myisamchk to mark the table as "checked".
#
# You have to repair only those tables for which myisamchk announces an error. for such tables, go to step 2.
#
# If you get unexpected errors when checking (such as out of memory errors), or if myisamchk crashes, go to Stage 3.
#
# STAGE 2: Easy safe repair
#
# First, try myisamchk -r -q tbl_name (-r -q means "quick recovery mode"):
#
# This attempts to repair the index file without touching the data file. 
#
# If the data file contains everything that it should and the delete links
#  point at the correct locations within the data file, this should work - and teh table is fixed.
#
# Thus, you can go to the next table.
#
# Otherwise, use the following procedure:
#
# 		1. Make a backup of the data file before continuing.
#
# 		2. Use myisamchk -r tbl_name (-r means "recovery mode"). This removes incorrect rows and deleted rows from teh data file and reconstructs the index file.
#
# 		3. If the preceding steps fail, use myisamchk --safe-recover tbl_name.
#
# 			Safe recovery mode uses an old recovery method that handles a few cases that regular recovery mode
# 			mode does not (but is slower).
# 
# 			NOTE:
# 				If you want a repair operation to go much faster, you should set the values of the sort_buffer_size and key_buffer_size variables each to about
# 				25% of your available memory when running myisamchk.
#
# 			If you get unexpected errors when repairing (such as out of memory errors), or if myisamchk crashes, go to Stage 3.
#
# STAGE 3: Difficult Repair
#
# You should reach this stage only if the first 16 kb block in the index file is destroyed or contains incorrect information,
# 	or if the index file is missing.
#
# In this case, it is necessary to create a new index file.
#
# Do as follows:
#
# 		1. Move the data to a safe place.
#
# 		2. Use the table desc. file to create new (empty) data and index files:
#
# 				mysql db_name
#
# 				SET autocommit=1;
# 				TRUNCATE TABLE tbl_name;
# 				quit
#
# 		3. Copy the old data file back onto the newly created data file.
# 			(Do not just move the old file back onto the new file. You want to retain a copy in case something goes wrong)
#
# 			IMPORTANT:
#
# 				If you are using replication, you should stop it prior to performing the above procedure, since it involves
# 				file system operations, and these are not logged by MySQL.
#
# 	Go back to Stage 2. myisamchk -r -q should work (This should not be an endless loop)
#
# You can also use the REPAIR TABLE tbl_name USE_FRM SQL statement, which performs the whole procedure automatically.
#
# There is also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a utility and the server, because the server does all
# the work when you use REPAIR_TABLE. More on REPAIR_TABLE later.
#
# MyISAM TABLE OPTIMIZATION
#
# To coalesce fragmented rows and eliminate wasted space that results from deleting or updating rows, run myisamchk in recovery mode:
#
# 		myisamchk -r tbl_name
#
# You can optimize a table in the same way by using the OPTIMIZE_TABLE SQL statement.
#
# OPTIMIZE_TABLE does a table repair and a key analysis, and also sorts the index tree so that
# key lookups are faster.
#
# There is also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a utility and the server, because the server
# does all the work when you use OPTIMIZE_TABLE. More on this later.
#
# myisamchk has a number of other options that you can use to improve the performance of a table:
#
# 		) --analyze or -a: Perform key distribution analysis. This improves join performance by enabling the join optimizer
# 									to better choose the order in which to join the tables and which indexes it should use.
#
# 		) --sort-index or -S: Sort the index blocks. This optimizes seeks and makes table scans that use indexes faster.
#
# 		) --sort-records=index_num or -R index_num: Sort data rows according to a given index. This makes your data much more
# 																	localized and may speed up range-based SELECT and ORDER BY operations that use this index.
#
# For a full description of all available options, see earlier.
#
# SETTING UP A MYISAM TABLE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
#
# It is a good idea to perform table checks on a regular basis rather than waiting for problems to occur.
# One way to check and repair MyISAM tables is with the CHECK_TABLE and REPAIR_TABLE statements. See later.
#
# Another way to check tables is to use myisamchk. For maintenance purposes, you can use myisamchk -s.
# THe -s (silent) causes myisamchk to run in silent mode, printing messages only when errors occur.
#
# It is also a good idea to enable automatic MyISAM table checking.
#
# For example, whenever the machine has done a restart in the middle of an update, you usually need to check
# each table that could have been affected before it is used further.
#
# (These are "expected crashed tables")
#
# To cause the server to check MyISAM tables automatically, start it with the --myisam-recover-options
# option. See earlier.
#
# You should also check your tables regularly during normal system operation.
# For example, you can run a cron job to check important tables once a week, using
# a line like this in a crontab file:
#
# 		35 0 * * 0 /path/to/myisamchk --fast --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
#
# THis prints out information about crashed tables so that you can examine and repair them as called for.
#
# To start with, execute myisamchk -s each night on all tables that have been updated during the last 24 hours.
# AS you see that problems occur infrequently, you can back off the checking frequency to once a week or so.
#
# Normally, MySQL tables need little maintenance. If you are performing many updates to MyISAM tables with
# dynamic-sized rows (tables with VARCHAR, BLOB or TEXT columns)
#
# or have tables with many deleted rows you may want to defragment/reclaim space from the tables
# from time to time.
#
# You can do this by using OPTIMIZE_TABLE on the tables in question.
#
# Alternatively, if you can stop the mysqld server for a while, change location into the data directory
# and use this command while the server is stopped:
#
# 		myisamchk -r -s --sort-index --myisam_sort_buffer_size=16M */*.MYI
#
# OPTIMIZATION
#
# This chapter explains how to optimize MySQL performance and provides examples.
#
# Optimization involves configuring, tuning and measuring performance, at several levels.
#
# Depending on your job role (developer, DBA or a combination), you might optimize at the level of individual
# SQL statements, entire applications, a single DB server or multiple networked DB servers.
#
# Sometimes you can be proactive and plan in advance for performance, while other times you might troubleshoot
# a configuration or code issue after a problem occurs.
#
# Optimizing CPU and memory usage can also improve scalability, allowing the DB to handle more load without
# slowing down.
#
# OPTIMIZATION OVERVIEW
#
# Database performance depends on several factors at the DB level, such as tables, queries and configuration settings.
#
# These software constructs result in CPU and I/O operations at the hardware level, which you must minimize and make
# as efficient as possible.
#
# As you work on DB performance, you start by learning the high-level rules and guidelines for the software side,
# and measuring performance using wall-clock time.
#
# As you get better, you learn m,ore about what happens internally, and start measuring things like CPU cycles and I/O operations.
#
# Typical users aim to get the best DB performance out of their existing software and hardware configurations.
#
# Advanced users look for oppurtounities to improve MySQL itself, or develop their own storage engines and hardware
# applicances to expand the MySQL ecosystem.
#
# OPTIMIZING AT THE DATABASE LEVEL
#
# The most important factor in making a database application fast is its basic design:
#
# 		) Are the tables structured properly? In particular, do the columns have the right data types and does each
# 			table have the appropriate columns for the type of work?
#
# 			For example, applications that perform frequent updates often have many tables with few columns,
# 			while applications that analyze large amounts of data often have few tables with many columns.
#
# 		) Are the right indexes in place to make queries efficient?
#
# 		) Are you using the appropriate storage engine for each table, and taking advantage of the strengths
# 			and features of each storage engine you use?
#
# 			In particular, the choice of a transactional engine such as InnoDB or a nontransactional one such as MyISAM
# 			can be very important for performance and scalability.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				InnoDB is the default storage engine for new tables. In practice, the advanced InnoDB performance
# 				features mean that InnoDB tables often outperform the simpler MyISAM tables, esp. for a busy DB.
#
# 		) Does each table use an appropriate row format?
#
# 			This choice also depends on the storage engine used for the table. 
#
# 			IN particular, compressed tables use less disk space and so require less disk
# 			I/O to read and write the data.
#
# 			Compression is available for all kinds of workloads with InnoDB tables, and for read-only MyISAM tables.
#
# 		) Does the application use an appropriate locking strategy?
#
# 			For example, by allowing shared access when possible so that database operations can
# 			run concurrently, and requesting exclusive access when appropriate so that critical operations
# 			get top priority.
#
# 			Again, the choice of storage engine is significant.
#
# 			The InnoDB storage engine handles most locking issues without involvement from you, allowing
# 			for better concurrency in the database and reducing the amount of experimentation and tuning for
# 			your code.
#
# 		) Are all memory areas used for caching sized correctly?
#
# 			That is, large enough to hold frequently accessed data, but not so large that they overload
# 			physical memory and cause paging.
#
# 			The main memory areas to configure are the InnoDB buffer pool and the MyISAM key cache.
#
# OPTIMIZING AT THE HARDWARE LEVEL
#
# Any database application eventually hits hardware limits as the DB becomes more and more busy.
#
# A DBA must evaluate whether it is possible to tune the application or reconfigure the server to
# avoid these bottlenecks, or whether more hardware resources are required.
#
# System bottlenecks typically arise from these sources:
#
# 		) Disk seeks. It takes time for the disk to find a piece of data.
#
# 		With modern disks, the mean time for this is usually lower than 10ms, so we can in theory
# 		do about 100 seeks a second.
#
# 		this time improves slowly with new disks and is very hard to optimize for a single table.
#
# 		The way to optimize seek time is to distribute the data onto more than one disk.
#
# 		) Disk reading and writing.
#
# 			When the disk is at the correct position, we need to read or write the data.
#
# 			With modern disks, one disk delivers at least 10-20MB/s throughput.
#
# 			this is easier to optimize than seeks, because you can read in parallel from multiple disks.
#
# 		) CPU cycles. When the data is in main memory, we must process it to get our result.
#
# 			Having large tables compared to the amount of memory is the most common limit factor.
#
# 			But with small tables, speed is usually not the problem.
#
# 		) Memory bandwidth. When the CPU needs more data than can fit in the CPU cache, the main memory bandwidth
# 			becomes a bottleneck.
#
# 			This is an uncommon bottleneck for most systems, but one to be aware of.
#
# BALANCING PORTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE
#
# To use performance-oriented SQL extensions in a portable MySQL program, you can wrap
# MySQL-specific keywords in a statement within /*! or */ comment delimiters.
#
# Other SQL servers ignore the command keywords. More on comments later.
#
# OPTIMIZING SQL STATEMENTS
#
# The core logic of a database application is performed through SQL statements, whether issued directly through
# an interpreter or submitted behind the scenes through an API.
#
# The tuning guidelines in this section helps to speed up all kinds of MySQL applications.
#
# The guidelines cover SQL operations that read and write data, the behind-the-scenes overhead for
# SQL operations in general, and operations used in specific scenarios such as database monitoring.
#
# OPTIMIZING SELECT STATEMENTS
#
# Queries, in teh form of SELECT statements, perform all teh lookup operations in the DB.
#
# Tuning these statements is a top priority, whether to achieve sub-second response times for dynamic web pages,
# or to chop hours off the time to generate huge overnight reports.
#
# Besides SELECT statements, the tuning techniques for queries also apply to constructs such as CREATE_TABLE---AS_SELECT,
# INSERT_INTO---SELECT, and WHERE clauses in DELETE statements.
#
# Those statements have additional performance considerations because they combine write operations with the read-oriented
# query operations.
#
# NDB Cluster supports a join pushdown optimization whereby a qualifying join is sent in its entirety to NDB Cluster data nodes,
# where it can be distributed among them and executed in parallel.
#
# For more information about this optimization, see Conditions for NDB pushdown joins.
#
# The main consideration for optimizing queries are:
#
# 		) To make a slow SELECT_---_WHERE query faster, the first thing to check is whether you can add an index.
#
# 			Set up indexes on columns used in the WHERE clause, to speed up evaluation, filtering and the final retrieval of results.
#
# 			To avoid wasted disk space, construct a small set of indexes that speed up many related queries used in your
# 			application.
#
# 			Indexes are especially important for queries that reference different tables, using features such as joins and foreign keys.
# 			You can use the EXPLAIN statement to determine which indexes are used for a SELECT.
#
# 			See more later on indexes and EXPLAIN optimizations.
#
# 		) Isolate and tune any part of the query, such as a function call, that takes excessive time.
#
# 			Depending on how the query is structured, a function could be called once for every row in
# 			in the result set, or even once for every row in the table, greatly magnifying any inefficiency.
#
# 		) Minimize the number of full table scans in your queries, particularly for big tables.
#
# 		) Keep table statistics up to date by using the ANALYZE_TABLE statement periodically, so the optimizer
# 			has the information needed to construct an efficient execution plan.
#
# 		) Learn the tuning techniques, indexing techniques and configuration parameters that are specific to the storage
# 			engine for each table.
#
# 			Both InnoDB and MyISAM have sets of guidelines for enabling and sustaining high performance in queries.
#
# 			MOre details on InnoDB Queries and MyISAM queries, later.
#
# 		) You can optimize single-query transactions for InnoDB tables, using the technique outlayed later in optimizing InnoDB Read-Only transactions
#
# 		) Avoid transforming the query in ways that make it hard to understand, especially if the optimizer does some of the same transformations automatically.
#
# 		) If a performance issue is not easily solved by one of the basic guidelines, investigate the internal details of the specific Query
# 			by reading the EXPLAIN plan and adjusting your indexes, WHERE clauses, join clauses, and so on.
#
# 			(When you reach a certain level of expertise, reading the EXPLAIN plan might be your first step for every query)
#
# 		) Adjust the size and properties of the memory areas that MySQL uses for caching.
#
# 			With efficient use of the InnoDB buffer pool, MyISAM key cache and the MysQL query cache,
# 			repeated queries run faster because the results are retrieved from memory the second and subsequent times.
#
# 		) Even for a query that runs fast using the cache memory areas, you might still optimize further so that they require
# 			less cache memory, making your application more scalable.
#
# 			Scalability means that your application can handle more simultaneous users, large requests, and so on, without
# 			experiencing a big drop in performance.
#
# 		) Deal with locking issues, where the speed of your query might be affected by other sesisons accessing the tables
# 			at the same time.
#
# WHERE CLAUSE OPTIMIZATION
#
# This section discusses optimizations that can be made for processing WHERE Clauses.
#
# The examples use SELECT statements, but the same optimizations apply for WHERE clauses in DELETE
# and UPDATE statements.
#
# NOTE:
# 		BEcause work on the MySQL optimizer is ongoing, not all of the optimizations that MySQL performs are documented here.
#
# You might be tempted to rewrite your queries to make arithemtic operations faster, while sacrificing readability.
# 
# Because MySQL does similar optimizations automatically, you can often avoid this work, and leave the query in a
# more understandable and maintainable form.
#
# Some of the optimizations performed by MySQL follow:
#
# 		) Removal of unnecessary parantheses:
#
# 			((a AND b) AND c OR ((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))
#
# 				Becomes
#
#
# 			(a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)
#
# 		) Constant folding
#
# 			(a<b AND b=c) AND a=5
#
# 				Becomes
#
# 			b>5 AND b=c AND a=5
#
# 		) Constant condition removal (needed because of constant folding):
#
# 			(B>=5 AND B=5) OR (B=6 AND 5=5) OR (B=7 AND 5=6)
# 			
# 				Becomes
#
# 			B=5 OR B=6
#
# 		) Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once.
#
# 		) COUNT(*) on a single tab without a WHERE is retrieved directly from the table information for MyISAM and MEMORY tables.
# 			This is also done for any NOT NULL expression when used with only one table.
#
# 		) Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly detects that some SELECT statements are impossible and returns no rows.
#
# 		) HAVING is merged with WHERE if you do not use GROUP BY or aggreggate functions (COUNT(), MIN() and so on)
#
# 		) For each table in a join, a simpler WHERE is constructed to get a faster WHERE evaluation for the table and also to skip
# 			rows as soon as possible.
#
# 		) All constant tables are read first before any other tables in the query. A constant table is any of the following:
#
# 			) An empty table or a table with one row.
#
# 			) A table that is used with a WHERE clause on a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE index, where all index parts are compared to
# 				constant expressions and are defined as NOT NULL.
#
# 			All of the following tables are used as constant tables:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t WHERE primary_key=1;
# 				SELECT * FROM t1,t2
# 					WHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;
#
# 		) The best join combination for joining the tables is found by trying all possibilities.
#
# 			If all columns in ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses come from the same table, that table is
# 			preferred first when joining.
#
# 		) If there is an ORDER BY clause and a different GROUP BY clause, or if the ORDER BY or GROUP BY
# 			contains columns from tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary table is created.  			
#
# 		) If you use the SQL_SMALL_RESULT modifier, MySQL uses an in-memory temporary table.
#
# 		) Each table index is queried, and the best index is used unless the optimizer believes that it is more efficient
# 			to use a table scan.
#
# 			At one time, a scan was used based on whether the best index spanned more than 30% of the table, but a fixed
# 			% no longer determines the choice between using an index or a scan.
#
# 			The optimizer now is more complex and bases its estimate on additional factors such as table size, number of rows,
# 			and I/O block size.
#
# 		) In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even consulting the data file.
#
# 			If all columns used from the index are numeric, only the index tree is used to resolve the query.
#
# 		) Before each row is output, those that do not match the HAVING clause are skipped.
#
# Some examples of queries that are very fast:
#
# 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name;
#
# 		SELECT MIN(key_part1), MAX(key_part1) FROM tbl_name;
#
# 		SELECT MAX(key_part2) FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=constant;
#
# 		SELECT_---_FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1, key_part2,___ LIMIT 10;
#
# 		SELECT_---_FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 DESC, ___ LIMIT 10;
#
# MySQL resolves the following queries using only the index tree, assuming that the indexed columns
# are numeric:
#
# 		SELECT key_part1, key_part2 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val;
#
# 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val1 AND key_part2=val2;
#
# 		SELECT key_part2 FROM tbl_name GROUP BY key_part1;
#
# The following queries use indexing to retrieve the rows in sorted order without a separate sorting pass:
#
# 		SELECT_---_FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1, key_part2, ---;
#
# 		SELECT_---_FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 DESC, ---;
#
# 	Note: The --- are the triple dots, synonym for "etc.", i cannot write the triple dots in this document due to unnessecary querying.
#
# RANGE OPTIMIZATION
#
# The range access method uses a single index to retrieve a subset of table rows that are contained within
# one or several index value intervals.
#
# It can be used for single-part or multi-part index. The following section describes conditions under which
# the optimizer uses range access.
#
# 	) Range Access Method for Single-part indexes
#
# 	) Range ACcess Method for Multiple-part indexes
#
# 	) Equality Range Optimization of Many-Valued Comparisons
#
# 	) Skin Scan Range Access Method
#
# 	) Range Optimization of Row Constructor Expressions
#
# 	) Limiting Memory Use for Range Optimization
#
# RANGE ACCESS METHOD FOR SINGLE-PART INDEXES
#
# For a single-part index, index value intervals can be conveniently represented by corresponding conditions in the
# WHERE clause, denoted as range conditions rather than "intervals".
#
# The definition of a range condition for a single-part index is as follows:
#
# 		) For both BTREE and HASH indexes, comparisons of a key part with a constant value is a range condition when using the
# 			=, <=>, IN(), IS_NULL, or IS_NOT_NULL operators.
#
# 		) Additionally, for BTREE indexes, comparisons of a key part with a constant value is a range condition when using
# 			the >, <, >=, <=, BETWEEN, !=, or <> operators, or LIKE comparisons if the argument to LIKE is a 
# 			constant string that does not start with a wildcard character.
#
# 		) for all index types, multiple range conditions combined with OR or AND form a range condition.
#
# "Constant value" in the preceding descriptions means one of the following:
#
# 		) A constant from the query string
#
# 		) A column of a const or system table from teh same join
#
# 		) The result of an uncorrelated subquery
#
# 		) Any expression composed entirely from subexpressions of the preceding types.
#
# Here are some examples of Queries with range conditions in the WHERE clause:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 			WHERE key_col > 1
# 			AND key_col < 10;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 			WHERE key_col = 1
# 			OR key_col IN (15,18,20);
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 			WHERE key_col LIKE 'ab%'
# 			OR key_col BETWEEN 'bar' AND 'foo';
#
# Some nonconstant values may be converted to constants during the optimizer constant propagation phase.
#
# MySQl tries to extract the range conditions from the WHERE clause for each of the possible indexes.
#
# During the extraction process, conditions that cannot be used for constructing the range condition are dropped,
# conditions that produce overlapping ranges are combined, and conditions that produce empty ranges are removed.
#
# Consider the following statement, where key1 is an indexed column and nonkey is not indexed:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE
# 			(key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR key1 LIKE '%b')) OR
# 			(key1 < 'bar' AND nonkey = 4) OR
# 			(key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z');
#
# The extraction process for key key1 is as follows:
#
# 		1. Start with the original WHERE clause:
#
# 			(key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR key1 LIKE '%b')) OR
# 			(key1 < 'bar' AND nonkey = 4) OR
# 			(key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z')
#
# 		2. Remove nonkey = 4 and key1 LIKE '%b' because they cannot be used for a range scan.
#
# 			The correct way to remove them is to replace them with TRUE, so that we do not miss any matching rows
# 			when doing the range scan.
#
# 			Replacing them with TRUE yields:
#
# 				(key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR TRUE)) OR
# 				(key1 < 'bar' AND TRUE) OR
# 				(key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z')
#
# 		3. Collapse conditions that are always true or false:
#
# 				(key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR TRUE) is always true
#
# 				(key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z') is always false
#
# 			Replacing these conditions with constants yields:
#
# 				(key1 < 'abc' AND TRUE) OR (key1 < 'bar' AND TRUE) OR (FALSE)
#
# 			Removing unnecessary TRUE and FALSE constants yields:
#
# 				(key1 < 'abc') OR (key1 < 'bar')
#
# 		4. Combining overlapping intervals into one yields the final condition to be used for hte range scan:
#
# 			(key1 < 'bar')
#
# In general (and as demonstrated by the preceding example), the condition used for a range scan is less restrictive
# than the WHERE clause.
#
# Mysql performs an additional check to filter out rows that satisfy the range condition but not the full WHERE clause.
#
# The range condition extraction algorithm can handle nested AND/OR constructs of arbitrary depth, and its output does
# not depend on the order in which conditions appear in WHERE clause.
#
# MySQL does not support merging multiple ranges for the range access method for spatial indexes.
#
# To work around this limitation, you can use a UNION with identical SELECT statements, except that
# you put each spatial predicate in a different SELECT.
#
# RANGE ACCESS METHOD FOR MULTIPLE-PART INDEXES
#
# Range conditions on a multiple-part index are an extension of range conditions for a single-part index.
#
# A range condition on a multiple-part index restricts index rows to lie within one or several key tuple intervals. 
#
# Key tuple intervals are defined over a set of key tuples, using ordering from the index.
#
# For example, consider a multiple-part index defined as key1(key_part1, key_part2, key_part3), and the following
# set of key tuples listed in key order:
#
# 		key_part1 		key_part2 		key_part3
# 			NULL 				1 					'abc'
# 			NULL 				1 					'xyz'
# 			NULL 				2 					'foo'
# 			1 					1 					'abc'
# 			1 					1 					'xyz'
# 			1 					2 					'abc'
# 			2 					1 					'aaa'
#
# The condition key_part1 = 1 defines this inteval:
#
# (1, -inf, -inf) <= (key_part1, key_part2, key_part3) < (1, +inf, +inf)
#
# The interval converts the 4th and 5th and 6th tuples in the preceding data set and can be used by the range
# access method.
#
# By contrast, the condition key_part3 = 'abc' does not define a single interval and cannot be used by the range access method.
#
# The following descriptions indicate how range conditions work for multiple-part indexes in greater detail.
#
# 		) For HASH indexes, each interval containing identical values can be used.
#
# 		This means that the interval can be produced only for conditions in the following form:
#
# 			key_part1 cmp const1
# 		AND key_part2.cmp const2
# 		AND ---
# 		AND key_partN cmp constN
#
# Here, const1, const2, --- are constants, cmp is one of the =,<=>, or IS_NULL comparison operators, and the conditions
# cover all index parts.
#
# (That is, there are N conditions, one for each part of an N-part index). For example, the following is a range condition
# for a three-part HASH index:
#
# 		key_part1 = 1 AND key_part2 IS NULL AND key_part3 = 'foo'
#
# FOr the definition of what is considered to be a constant, see Range Access Methods ofr Single-part indexes.
#
# ) For a BTREE index, an interval might be usable for conditions combined with AND, where each condition compares a key part with a 
# 		constant value using =, <=>, IS_NULL, >, <, >=, <=, !=, <>, BETWEEN, or LIKE_'pattern' (where 'pattern' does not start with a %).
#
# 	An interval can be used as long as it is possible to determine a single key tuple containing all rows that match the condition
# 	(or two intervals if <> or != is used)
#
# 	The optimizer attempts ot use additional key parts to determine the interval as long as the comparison operator is =, <=>, or IS_NULL.
# 	If the operator is >, <, >=, <=, !=, <>, BETWEEN or LIKE, the optimizer uses it but considers no more key parts.
#
# 	For the following expression, the optimizer uses = from the first comparison.
#
# 	It also uses >= from the second comparison but considers no further key pats and does not use the htird comparison
# 	for interval construction:
#
# 		key_part1 = 'foo' AND key_part2 >= 10 and key_part3 > 10
#
# 	The single interval is:
#
# 		('foo',10,-inf) < (key_part1, key_part2, key_part3) < ('foo',+inf,+inf)
#
# 	It is possible that the created interval contains more rows than the intiail condition.
#
# 	For example, the preceding interval includes the value ('foo', 11, 0) which does not satisfy the original condition.
#
# ) If conditions that cover sets of rows contained within intervals are combined with OR, they form a condition taht covers
# 		a set of rows contained within the union of their intervals.
#
# 		If the conditions are combined with AND, they form a condition that covers a set of rows contained within the intersection
# 		of their intervals.
#
# 		For example, for this condition on a two-part index:
#
# 			(key_part1 = 1 AND key_part2 < 2) OR (key_part1 > 5)
#
# 		The intervals are:
#
# 			(1, -inf) < (key_part1, key_part2) < (1,2)
# 			(5, -inf) < (key_part1, key_part2)
#
# 		IN this example, the interval of the first line uses one key part for the left bound and two key parts for the right bound.
#
# 		The interval on the second line uses only one key part.
#
# 		The key_len column in the EXPLAIN output indicates the max length of the key prefixed used.
#
# 		In some cases, key_len may indicate that a key part was used, but that might be not what you would expect.
#
# 		SUppose that key_part1 and key_part2 can be NULL.
#
# 		THen the key_len column displays two key part lengths for the following condition:
#
# 			key_part1 >= 1 AND key_part2 < 2
#
# 		But in fact, the condition is converted to this:
#
# 			key_part1 >= 1 AND key_part2 IS NOT NULL
#
# 		For a description of how optimizations are performed to combine or eliminate intervals for range conditions on a single-part index,
# 		see Range Access method for Single-part indexes.
#
# 		Analogous steps are perforemd for range conditions on multiple-part indexes.
#
# EQUALITY RANGE OPTIMIZATION OF MANY-VALUED COMPARISONS
#
# Consider these expressions, where col_name is an indexed column:
#
# 		col_name IN(val1, ---, valN)
# 		col_name = val1 OR --- OR col_name = valN
#
# Each expression is true if col_name is equal to any of several values.
#
# These comparisons are equality range comparisons (where the "range" is a single value).
# The optimizer estimates the cost of reading qualifying rows for equality range comparisons as follows:
#
# 		) If there is a unique index on col_name, the row estimate for each range is 1 because at most one row can ahve the given value
#
# 		) Otherwise, any index on col_name is a nonunique and the optimizer can estimate the row count for eaach range using dives into
# 			the index or index statistics.
#
# With index dives, the optimizer makes a dive at each end of a range and uses the number of rows in the range as the estimate.
#
# FOr example, the expression col_name IN (10, 20, 30) has three equality ranges and teh optimizer makes two dives per range to generate a row estimate.
#
# Each pair of dives yields an estimate of the number of rows that have the given value.
#
# Index dives provide accurate row estimates, but as the number of comparison values in the expression increases, the optimizer
# takes longer to genrate a row estimate.
#
# Use of index statitics is elss accurate than index dives but permits faster row estimation for large value lists.
#
# The eq_range_index_dive_limit system variable enables you to configure the number of values at which the optimizer switches
# from one row estimation strategy to the other.
#
# To permit use of index dives for comparisons of up to N equality ranges, set eq_range_index_dive_limit to N + 1.
#
# To disable use of statistics and always use index dives regardless of N, set eq_range_index_dive_limit to 0.
#
# TO update table index statistics for best estimates, use ANALYZE_TABLE
#
# Prior to MysQL 8.0, there is no way of skipping that use of index dives to estimate index usefulness, except by using the eq_range_index_dive_limit system variable.
#
# In > 8.0, index dive skipping is possible for queries that satisfy all of these conditions:
#
# 		) The query is for a single table, not a join on multiple tables.
#
# 		) A single-index FORCE INDEX index hint is present. 
#
# 			The idea is that if index use is forced, there is nothing to be gained from the additional
# 			overhead of performing dives into the index.
#
# 		) The index is nonunique and not a FULLTEXT index.
#
# 		) No subquery is present.
#
# 		) No DISTINCT, GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause is present.
#
# For EXPLAIN_FOR_CONNECTION, the output changes as follows if index dives are skipped:
#
# 		) For traditional output, the rows and filtered values are NULL.
#
# 		) For JSON output, rows_examined_per_scan and rows_produced_per_join do not appear, skip_index_dive_due_to_force is true, and cost calculations
# 			are not accurate.
#
# Without FOR CONNECTION, EXPLAIN output does not change when index dives are skipped.
#
# After execution of a query for which index dives are skipped, the corrsponding row in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OPTIMIZER_TRACE table
# contains an index_dives_for_range_access value of skipped_due_to_force_index
#
# SKIP SCAN RANGE ACCESS METHOD
#
# Consider the following scenario:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (f1 INT NOT NULL, f2 INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(f1, f2));
# 		INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
# 			(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5),
# 			(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5);
#
# 		INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 5 FROM t1;
# 		INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 10 FROM t1;
# 		INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 20 FROM t1;
#
# 		INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 40 FROM t1;
#
# 		ANALYZE TABLE t1;
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT f1, f2 FROM t1 WHERE f2 > 40;
#
# To execute this query, MySQL can choose an index scan to fetch all rows (the index includes all columns to be selected),
# then apply the f2 > 40 condition from the WHERE clause to produce the final result set.
#
# A range scan is more efficient than a full index scan, but cannot be used in this case because there is no condition
# on f1, the first index column.
#
# However, as of MySQL 8.0.13, the optimizer can perform multiple range scans, one for each value of 1, using a method
# called Skip Scan that is similar to Loose Index Scan (see later under GROUP BY optimization)
#
# 	1. Skip between distinct values of the first index part, f1 (the index prefix)
#
# 	2. Perform a subrange scan on eahc distinct prefix value for the f2 > 40 condition on the remaining index part.
#
# For the data set shown earlier, the algorithm operates like this:
#
# 	1. Get the first distinct value of the first key part (f1 = 1)
#
# 	2. Construct the range based on the first and second key parts (f1 = 1 AND f2 > 40)
#
# 	3. Perform a range scan
#
# 	4. Get the next distinct value of the key first part (f1 = 2)
#
# 	5. Construct the range based on the first and second key parts (f1 = 2 AND f2 > 40)
#
# 	6. Perform a range scan
#
# Using this strategy decreases the number of accessed rows because MySQL skips the rows that do not qualify
# for each constructed range.
#
# THe SKip Scan method is applicable under the following conditions:
#
# ) Table T has at least one compound index with key parts of the form ([A_1, ---, A_k,] B_1, ---, B_m, C[,D_1,---,D_n])
#
# Key parts A and D may be empty, but B and C must be nonempty.
#
# ) The query references onl one table
#
# ) The query does not use GROUP BY or DISTINCT
#
# ) The query references only columns in teh index
#
# ) The predicates on A_1, ---, A_k must be equality predicates and they must be constants. This includes the IN() operator.
#
# ) The query must be a conjunctive query; that is, an AND of OR conditions: (cond1(key_part1) OR cond2(key_part1)) AND (cond1(key_part2) OR ---) AND ---
#
# ) There must be a range condition on C
#
# ) Conditions on D columns are permitted. Conditions on D must be in conjunction with the range condition on C.
#
# Use of Skip Scan is indicated in EXPLAIN output as follows:
#
# 		) Using index for skip scan in the Extra column indicates that hte loose index Skip Scan access method is used.
#
# 		) If teh index can be used for Skip Scan, the index should be visible in the possible_keys column.
#
# Use of SKip scan is indicated in the optimizer trace output by a "skip scan" element of this form:
#
# "skip_scan_range": {
# 		"type": "skip_scan",
# 		"index": index_used_for_skip_scan,
# 		"key_parts_used_for_access": [key_parts_used_for_access],
# 		"range": [range]
# }
#
# You may also see a "best_skip_scan_summary" element.
#
# If Skip Scan is chosen as the best range access variant, a "chosen_range_access_summary" is written.
# If SKip Scan is chosen as the overall best access method, a "best_access_path" element is present.
#
# Use of Skip Scan is subject to the value of the skip_scan flag of the optimizer_switch system variable.
#
# More later in regards to Switchable Optimizations.
#
# By default, this flag is on. To disable it, set skip_scan to off.
#
# In addition to using the optimizer_switch system variable to control optimizer use of Skip Scan session-wide,
# MySQL supports optimizer hints to influence the optimizer on a per-statement basis. 
#
# More on optimizer hints later.
#
# RANGE OPTIMIZATION OF ROW CONSTRUCTOR EXPRESSIONS
#
# The optimizer is able to apply the range scan access method to queries of this form:
#
# 		SELECT --- FROM t1 WHERE ( col_1, col_2 ) IN (( 'a', 'b' ), ( 'c', 'd' ));
#
# Previously, for range scans to be used, it was necessary to write the query as:
#
# 		SELECT --- FROM t1 WHERE ( col_1 = 'a' AND col_2 = 'b' ) OR ( col_1 = 'c' AND col_2 = 'd');
#
# For the optimizer to use a range scan, queries must satisfy these conditions:
#
# 		) Only IN() predicates are used, not NOT_IN()
#
# 		) On the left side of the IN() predicate, the row constructor contains only column references.
#
# 		) On the right side of the IN() predicate, row constructors contain only runtime constants, which are either
# 			literals or local column references that are bound to constants during execution.
#
# 		) On the right side of the IN() predicate, there is more than one row constructor.
# 		
# For more information about the optimizer and row constructors, see later under ROW CONSTRUCTOR EXPRESSION OPTIMIZATION
#
# LIMIT MEMORY USE FOR RANGE OPTIMIZATION
#
# TO control the memory available to the range optimizer, use teh range_optimizer_max_mem_size system variable.
#
# ) A value of 0 means "no limit"
#
# ) With a value of > 0, the optimizer tracks the memory consumed when considering the range access method.
#
# 		IF the specified limit is about to be exceeded, the range access method is abandoned and other methods,
# 		including a full table scan, are considered instead.
#
# 		This could be less optimal.
#
# 		If this happens, the following warning occurs (where N is the current range_optimizer_max_mem_size value):
#
# 			Warning 3170 Memory capacity of N bytes for 'range_optimizer_max_mem_size' exceeded.
# 							 Range optimization was not done for this query.
#
# ) For UPDATE and DELETE statements, if the optimizer falls back to a full table scan and the sql_safe_updates system variable
# 		is enabled, an error occurs rather than a warning, because in effect - no key is used to determine which rows to modify.
#
# 		For more information, see earlier.
#
# For individual queries that exceed the available range optimization memory and for which the optimizer falls back
# to less optimal plans, increasing the range_optimizer_max_mem_size value may improve performance.
#
# To estimate the amount of memory needed to process a range expression, use these guidelines:
#
# 		) For a simple query such as the following, where there is one candidate key for the range access method,
# 			each predicate combined with OR uses approximately 230 bytes:
#
# 			SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
# 			WHERE a=1 OR a=2 OR a=3 OR --- a=N;
#
# 		) Similarly for a query such as the following, each predicate combined with AND uses approximately 125 bytes:
#
# 			SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
# 			WHERE a=1 AND b=1 AND c=1 --- N;
#
# 		) For a query with IN() predicates:
#
# 			SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
# 			WHERE a IN (1,2, ---, M) AND b IN (1,2, ---, N);
#
# 			Each literal value in an IN() list countsas a predicate combined with OR.
#
# 			If there are two IN() lists, the number of predicates combined with OR is the product of the number of
# 			literal values in each list.
#
# 			Thus, the number of predicates combined with OR in the preceding case is M x N
#
# INDEX MERGE OPTIMIZATION
#
# The Index Merge access method retrieves rows with multiple range scans and merges their results into one.
#
# This access method merges index scans from a single table only, not scans across multiple tables.
#
# The merge can produce unions, intersections, or unions-of-intersections of its underlying scans.
#
# Example queries for which Index Merge may be used:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key1 = 10 OR key2 = 20;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 			WHERE (key1 = 10 OR key2 = 20) AND non_key = 30;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2
# 			WHERE (t1.key1 IN (1,2) OR t1.key2 LIKE 'value%')
# 			AND t2.key1 = t1.some_col;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2
# 			WHERE t1.key1 = 1
# 			AND (t2.key1 = t1.some_col OR t2.key2 = t1.some_col2);
#
# Note:
#
# 		The Index Merge optimization algorithm ahs the following limitations:
#
# 			) If your query has a complex WHERE clause with deep AND/OR nesting and MySQL does not choose
# 				the optimal plan, try distributing terms using the following identity transformations:
#
# 				(x AND y) OR z => (x OR z) AND (y OR z)
# 				(x OR y) AND z => (x AND z) OR (y AND z)
#
# 			) Index Merge is not applicable to full-text indexes.
#
# In EXPLAIN output, the Index Merge method appears as index_merge in the type column.
#
# In this case, the key column contains a list of indexes used, and key_len contains
# a list of the longest key parts of those indexes.
#
# The Index Merge access method has several algorithms, which are displayed in the Extra field of EXPLAIN output:
#
# 		) Using intersect(---)
#
# 		) Using union(---)
#
# 		) Using sort_union(---)
#
# The following sections describe these algorithms in greater detail.
#
# THe optimizer chooses between different possible Index Merge algorithms and other access
# methods based on cost estimates of the various available options. 
#
# INDEX MERGE INTERSECTION ACCESS ALGORITHM
#
# This access algorithm is applicable where a WHERE clause is converted to several range conditions
# on different keys combined with AND and each condition is one of the following:
#
# 		) An N-part expression of this form, where the index has exactly N parts (that is, all index parts are covered):
#
# 			key_part1 = const1 AND key_part2 = const2 --- AND key_partN = constN
#
# 		) Any range condition over the primary key of an InnoDB table.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM innodb_table
# 			WHERE primary_key < 10 AND key_col1 = 20;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 			WHERE key1_part1 = 1 AND key1_part2 = 2 AND key2 = 2;
#
# The Index Merge intersection algorithm performs simultaneous scans on all used indexes and produces
# the intersection of row sequences that it receives from the merged index scans.
#
# If all columns used in teh query are covered by the used indexes, full table rows are not retreived 
# (EXPLAIN output contains Using index in Extra field in this case).
#
# Here is an example of such a query:
#
# 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 WHERE key1 = 1 AND key2 = 1;
#
# If the used indexes do not cover all columns used in the query, full rows are retrieved only
# when the range conditions for all used keys are satisfied.
#
# If one of the merged conditions is a condition over the primary key of an InnoDB table, it is not 
# used for row retrieval, but is used to filter out rows retrieved using other
# conditions.
#
# INDEX MERGE UNION ACCESS ALGORITHM
#
# The criteria for this algorithm are similar to those for the Index Merge intersection algorithm.
#
# The aplgorithm is applicable where the tables WHERE clause is converted to several range conditions
# on different keys combined with OR, and each condition is one of the following:
#
# 		) An N-part expression of this form, where the index has exactly N parts (that is, all index parts are covered):
#
# 			key_part1 = const1 AND key_part2 = const2 --- AND key_partN = constN
#
# 		) Any range condition over a primary key of an InnoDB table
#
# 		) A condition for which the Index Merge intersection algorithm is applicable
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 			WHERE key1 = 1 OR key2 = 2 OR key3 = 3;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM innodb_table
# 			WHERE (key1 = 1 AND key2 = 2)
# 				OR (key3 = 'foo' AND key4 = 'bar') AND key5 = 5;
#
# INDEX MERGE SORT-UNION ACCESS ALGORITHM
#
# This access algorithm is applicable when the WHERE Clause is converted to several range conditions
# combined by OR, but the Index Merge union algorithm is not applicable.
#
# Example:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 			WHERE key_col1 < 10 OR key_col2 < 20;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 			WHERE (key_col1 > 10 OR key_col2 = 20) AND nonkey_col = 30;
#
# The difference between the sort-union algorithm and the union algorithm is that the sort-algorithm must first
# fetch row IDs for all rows and sort them before returning any rows.
#
# INFLUENCING INDEX MERGE OPTIMIZATION
#
# Use of Index Merge is subject to the value of the index_merge, index_merge_intersection,
# index_merge_union, and index_merge_sort_union flags of the optimizer_switch system variable.
#
# More on this later.
#
# By default, all those flags are on.
#
# To enable only certain algorithms, set index_merge to off, and enable only such of the others as should be permitted.
#
# In addition to using the optimizer_switch system variable to control optimizer use of the Index Merge algorithm
# session-wide, MySQL supports optimizer hints to influence the optimizer on a per-statement basis.
#
# See more under Optimizer Hints sections.
#
# ENGINE CONDITION PUSHDOWN OPTIMIZATION
#
# This optimization improves the efficiency of direct comparisons between a nonindexed column and a constant.
# In such cases, the condition is "pushed down" to the storage engine for evaluation.
#
# This optimization can be used only by the NDB storage engine.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The NDB storage engine is currently not available in MySQL 8.0.
#
# 		If you are interested in using NDB cluster, see MySQL NDB Cluster 7.5 and NDB cluster
# 		7.6, which provides information about MySQL cluster NDB 7.5 (based on MySQL 5.7, but containing
# 		the latest improvements and fixes for the NDBCLUSTER storage engine)
#
# INDEX CONDITION PUSHDOWN OPTIMIZATION
#
# Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) is an optimization for the case where MySQL retrieves rows from a table using an index.
#
# Without ICR, the storage engine traverses the index to locate rows in teh base table and returns them to the MySQL
# server which evaluates the WHERE condition for the rows.
#
# WIth ICP enabled, and if parts of the WHERE condition can be evaluated by using only columns from the index,
# teh MySQL server pushes this part of the WHERE condition down to the storage engine.
#
# The storage engine then evaluates the pushed index condition by using the index entry and only if this is satisfied,
#  is the row read from the table.
#
# ICP can reduce the number of times the storage engine must access the base table and the number of times the
# MySQL server must access the storage engine.
#
# Applicability of the Index Condition Pushdown optimization is subject to these conditions:
#
# ) ICP is used for the range, ref, eq_ref, and ref_or_null access methods, when there is a need to access full table rows.
#
# ) ICP can be used for InnoDB and MyISAM tables, including partitioned InnoDB and MyISAM tables.
#
# ) For InnoDB tables, ICP is used only for secondary indexes.
#
# 		The goal of ICP is to reduce the number of full-row reads and thereby reduce number of I/O operations.
#
# 		For InnoDB clustered indexes, the complete record is already read into the InnoDB buffer.
#
# 		Using ICp in this case does not reduce the I/O.
#
# ) ICP is not supported with secondary indexes created on virtual generated columns. InnoDB supports secondary indexes
# 		on virtual generated columns.
#
# ) Conditions that refer to subqueries cannot be pushed down
#
# ) COndition taht refer to stored functions cannot be pushed down. Storage engines cannot invoke stored functions.
#
# ) Triggered conditions cannot be pushed down. (For information about triggered conditions, see Optimizing Subqueries with the EXISTS Strategy)
#
# To understand how this optimization works, first consider how an index scan proceeds when Index Condition Pushdown is not used:
#
#  	1. Get hte next row, first by reading the index tuple and then by using the index tuple to locate and read the full table row.
#
# 		2. Test the part of the WHERE condition that applies to this table. Accept or Reject the row based on the test result.
#
# Using Index Condition Pushdown, the scan proceeds like this insteaqd:
#
# 		1. Get hte next row's index tuple (but not the full table row)
#
# 		2. Test the part of the WHERE condition that applies to this table and can be checked using only indexed columns.
# 			If the condition is not satisfied, proceed to the index tuple for the next row.
#
# 		3. If the condition is satisfied, use the index tuple to locate and read the full table row.
#
# 		4. Test the remaining part of the WHERE condition that applies to this table. Accept or reject the row based on teh test result.
#
# EXPLAIN output shows Using index condition in teh Extra column when Index Condition Pushdown is used.
# It does not show Using Index because that does not apply when the full table rows must be read.
#
# Suppose that a table contains information about people and their addresses and that the table has an index defined as INDEX
# (zipcode, lastname, firstname).
#
# If we know a person's zipcode value but are not sure about the last name, we can search like this:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM people
# 			WHERE zipcode='95054'
# 			AND lastname LIKE '%etrunia%'
# 			AND address LIKE '%Main Street%';
#
# MySQL cna use the index to scan through people with zipcode='9504'
#
# THe second part (lastname lIKE '%etrunia%') cannot be used to limit the number of rows that must be scanned,
# so without Index Condition Pushdown, this query must retrieve full table rows for all people who have zipcode '95054'
#
# With Index Condition Pushdown, MySQL checks the lastname LIKE '%etrunia%' part before reading the full table row.
# This avoids reading full rows corresponding to index tuples that match the zipcode condition but not the lastname condition.
#
# Index Condition Pushdown is enabled by default. It can be controlled with the optimizer_switch system variable by setting the
# index_condition_pushdown flag:
#
# 		SET optimizer_switch = 'index_condition_pushdown=off';
# 		SET optimizer_siwtch = 'index_condition_pushdown=on';
#
# See later in Switchable Optimizations for more.
#
# NESTED-LOOP JOIN ALGORITHMS
#
# MySQL executes joins between tables using a nested-loop algorithm or variations on it.
#
# NESTED-LOOP JOIN ALGORITHM
#
# A simple nested-loop join (NLJ) algorithm reads rows from the first table in a loop one at a time,
# passing each row to a nested loop that processes teh next table in the join.
#
# This process is repeated as many times as there remains tables to be joined.
#
# Assume that a join between three tables t1, t2 and t3 is to be executed using the following join types:
#
# 	Table 	JOin Type
# 	t1 		range
# 	t2 		ref
# 	t3 		ALL
#
# If a simple NLJ algorithm is used, the join is processed like this:
#
# for each row in t1 matching range {
# 		for each row in t2 matching reference key {
# 			for each row in t3 {
# 				if row satisfies join conditions, send to client
# 			}
# 		}
# }
#
# Because the NLJ Algorithm passes rows one at a time from outer loops to inner loops, it typically reads
# tables processed in the inner loops many times.
#
# Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm
#
# A Block Nested-Loop (BNL) join algorithm uses buffering of rows read in outer loops to reduce the number of 
# times that tables in inner loops must be read.
#
# For example, if 10 rows are read into a buffer and teh buffer is passed to the next inner loop,.
# each row read in teh inner loop can be compared against 10 rows in the buffer.
#
# This reduces by an order of magnitude the number of times the inner table must be read.
#
# MySQL join buffering has these characteristics:
#
# 		) Join buffering can be used when the join is of type ALL or index (in other words, when no possible keys can be used, and a full scan
# 			is done, of either the data or index rows, respectively), or range.
#
# 			Use of buffering is also applicable to outer joins, as described in BLOCK NESTED_LOOP AND BATCHED KEY ACCESS JOINS
#
# 		) A join buffer is never allocated for the first nonconstant table, even if it would be of type ALL or index.
#
# 		) Only columns of interest to a join are stored in its join buffer, not whole rows.
#
# 		) The join_buffer_size system variable determines the size of each join buffer used to process a query.
#
# 		) One buffer is allocated for each join that can be buffered, so a given query might be processed using multiple join buffers.
#
# 		) A join buffer is allocated prior to executing the join and freed after the query is done.
#
# For the example join described previously for the NLJ algorithm (without buffering), the join is done as follows using join buffering:
#
# 		for each row in t1 matching range {
# 			for each row in t2 matching reference key {
# 				store used columns from t1, t2 in join buffer
# 				if buffer is full {
# 					for each row in t3 {
# 						for each t1, t2 combination in join buffer {
# 							if row satisfies join conditions, send to client
# 						}
# 					}
# 					empty join buffer
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 		
# 		if buffer is not empty {
# 			for each row in t3 {
# 				for each t1, t2 combination in join buffer {
# 					if row satisfies join conditions, send to client
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
#
# If S is the size of each stored t1, t2 combination in the join buffer and C is the number of combinations in teh buffer,
# the number of times table t3 is scanned is:
#
# 	(S * C)/join_buffer_size + 1
#
# The number of t3 scans decereases  as the value of join_buffer_size increases, up to the point when join_buffer_size
# is large enough to hold all previous row combinations.
#
# At that point, no speed is gained by making it larger.
#
# NESTED JOIN OPTIMIZATION
#
# The syntax for expressing joins permits nested joins. The following discussion refers to joins syntax described later.
#
# The syntax of table_factor is extended in comparison with the SQL standard.
# The latter accepts only table_reference, not a list of them inside a pair of paranthesis.
#
# This is a conservative extension if we consider each comma in a list of table_referneces items as equivalent
# to an inner join.
#
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)
# 								ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)
#
# is equvialent to:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)
# 								ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)
#
# In MySQL, CROSS JOIN is syntatically equivalen to INNER JOIN, they can replace each other.
#
# In stnadard SQL, they are not equivalent, INNER JOIN is used with an ON clause; CROSS JOIN is used otherwise.
#
# In general, parathenses can be ignored in join expressions containing only inner join operations.
# Consider this join expression:
#
# t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 ON t2.b=t3.b OR t2.b IS NULL) ON t1.a=t2.a
#
# After removing parathenses and grouping operations to the left, that join expression transforms
# into this expression:
#
# (t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.a=t2.a) LEFT JOIN t3 ON t2.b=t3.b OR t2.b IS NULL
#
# Yet, the two expressions are not equivalent. To see this, suppose that the tables t1, t2, and t3 have the
# following state:
#
# 		) Table t1 contains rows (1), (2)
#
# 		) Table t2 contains row (1, 101)
# 		
# 		) Table t3 contains row (101)
#
# In this case, teh first expression returns a result set including the rows (1, 1, 101, 101), (2, NULL, NULL, NULL), whereas the
# second expression returns the rows (1, 1, 101, 101), (2,NULL,NULL,101):
#
# SELECT FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 on t2.b=t3.b OR t2.b IS NULL) ON t1.a=t2.a;
# +-------------------------------+
# | a 		| 	a 		| 	b´	| b 	 |
# +-------------------------------+
# | 		1  | 		1 	| 101 | 101  |
# | 		2 	| 	NULL 	| NULL| 101  |
# +-------------------------------+
#
# In the following example, an outer join operation is used together with an inner join operation:
#
# t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3) ON t1.a=t2.a
#
# That expression cannot be transformed into the following:
#
# t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.a=t2.a, t3
#
# FOr the given table states, the two expressions return different sets of rows:
#
# SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3) ON t1.a=t2.a;
# +-----------------------------------------------+
# | 	a 		| 		a 		| 		b 			|		b    |
# +-----------------------------------------------+
# | 	1 		| 		1 		| 	101 			| 101 	  |
# |	2 		| 		NULL 	| 	NULL 			| NULL 	  |
# +-----------------------------------------------+
#
# SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.a=t2.a, t3;
# +-----------------------------------------+
# | a 		| a 			| 		b 		| 		b |
# +-----------------------------------------+
# | 1 		| 1 			| 101 		| 101   |
# | 2 		| NULL 		| NULL 		| 101   |
# +-----------------------------------------+
#
# Therefore, If we omit parantheses in a join expression with outer join expressions, we might change the result set
# for the original expression.
#
# More exactly, we cannot ignore parantheses in the right operand of the left outer join operation and in teh left operand
# of a right join operation.
#
# IN other words, we cannot ignore parantheses for the inner table expressions of outer join operations.
# Parantheses for the other operand (operand for the outer table) can be ignored.
#
# The following Expression:
#
# (t1,t2) LEFT JOIN t3 ON P(t2.b,t3.b)
#
# Is equivalent to this expression for any tables t1,t2,t3 and any condition P over attributes t2.b and t3.b:
#
# t1, t2 LEFT JOIN t3 ON P(t2.b, t3.b)
#
# WHenevr the order of execution of join operations in a join expression (join_table) is not from left to right,
# we talk about nested joins. 
#
# Consider the following queries:
#
#  SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 ON t2.b=t3.b) ON t1.a=t2.a WHERE t1.a > 1
#
# 	SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3) ON t1.a=t2.a WHERE (t2.b=t3.b OR t2.b IS NULL) AND t1.a > 1
#
# Those queries are considered to contain these nested joins:
#
# t2 LEFT JOIN t3 ON t2.b=t3.b
# t2, t3
#
# In the first query, the nested join is formed with a left join operation. In teh second query, it is formed with an inner join operation.
#
# In the first query, the parentheses can be omitted: The grammatical structure of the join expression will dictate the same order
# of execution for join operations.
#
# For the second query, the parentheses cannot be omitted, although the join expression here can be interpreted unambigiously without them.
#
# In our extended syntax, the parentheses in (t2, t3) of the second query are required, although theoretically the query could
# be parsed without them:
#
# We still would have unambiguous syntactical structure for the query because LEFT JOIN and ON play the role of the left
# and right delimiters for the expression (t2, t3).
#
# The preceding examples demonstrate these points:
#
# 	) For join expressions involving only inner joins (and not outer joins), parantheses can be removed and joins evaluated left to right.
# 		In fact, tables can be evaluated in any order.
#
# 	) The same is not true, in general, for outer joins or for outer joins mixed with inner joins. Removal of parentheses may change the result.
#
# Queries with nested outer joins are executed in the same pipeline manner as queries with inner joins.
#
# More exactly, a variation of the nested-loop join algorithm is exploited.
#
# Recall the algorithm by which the nested-loop join executes a query (see more earlier)
#
# Suppose that a join query over 3 tables T1, T2, T3 has this form:
#
# SELECT * FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON P1(T1,T2)
# 						 INNER JOIN T3 ON P2(T2,T3)
# 	 WHERE P(T1,T2,T3)
#
# Here, P1(T1,T2) and P2(T3,T3) are some join conditions (on expressions), whereas P(T1,T2,T3) is a condition
# over columns of tables T1,T2,T3.
#
# The nested-loop join algorithm would execute this query in the following manner.
#
# FOR EACH row t1 in T1 {
# 		FOR EACH row t2 in T2 such that P1(t1,t2) {
# 			FOR EACH row t3 in T3 such that P2(t2,t3) {
# 				IF P(t1,t2,t3) {
# 					t:=t1||t2||t3; OUTPUT t;
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
# The notation t1||t2||t3 indicates a row constructed by concatenating the columns of rows t1, t2 and t3.
# In some of the following examples, NULL where a table name appears means a row in which NULL is used for each column
# of that table.
#
# For example, t1||t2||NULL indicates a row constructed by concatenating the columns of rows t1 and t2,
# and NULL for each column of t3. Such a row is said to be NULL-complemented.
#
# Now consider a query with nested outer joins:
#
# 	SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN
# 						(T2 LEFT JOIN T3 ON P2(T2,T3))
# 						ON P1(T1,T2)
# 	 	WHERE P(T1,T2,T3)
#
# For this query, modify the nested-loop pattern to obtain:
#
# 	FOR each row t1 in T1 {
# 		BOOL f1:=FALSE;
# 		FOR each row t2 in T2 such that P1(t1,t2) {
# 			BOOL f2:=FALSE;
# 			FOR each row t3 in T3 such that P2(t2,t3) {
# 				IF P(t1,t2,t3) {
# 					t:=t1||t2||t3; OUTPUT t;
# 				}
# 				f2=TRUE;
# 				f1=TRUE;
# 			}
# 			IF (!f2) {
# 				IF P(t1,t2,NULL) {
# 					t:=t1||t2||NULL; OUTPUT t;
# 				}
# 				f1=TRUE;
# 			}
# 		}
# 		IF (!f1) {
# 			IF P(t1,NULL,NULL) {
# 				t:=t1||NULL||NULL; OUTPUT t;
# 			}
# 		}
# 	}
#
# In general, for any nested loop for the first inner table in an outer join operation, a flag is introduced that is turned off
# before the loop and is checked after the loop.
#
# The flag, is turned on when for the current row from the outer table a match from the table representing the inner operand
# is found.
#
# If at the end of the loop cycle the flag is still off, no match has been found for the current row of the outer table.
#
# IN this case, the row is complemented by NULL values for the columns of the inner tables.
#
# The result row is passed to the final check for the output or into the next nested loop, but only if the row satisfies the join
# condition of all embedded outer joins.
#
# In the example, the outer join table expressed by the following expression is embedded:
#
# 		(T2 LEFT JOIN T3 ON P2(T2,T3))
#
# For the query with inner joins, the optimizer could choose a different order of nested loops, such as this one:
#
# 		FOR each row t3 in T3 {
# 			FOR each row t2 in T2 such that P2(t2,t3) {
# 				FOR each row t1 in T1 such that P1(t1,t2) {
# 					IF P(t1,t2,t3) {
# 						t:=t1||t2||t3; OUTPUT t;
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
#
# For queries with outer joins, the optimizer can choose only such an order where loops for outer tables precede
# loops for inner tables.
#
# Thus, for our query with outer joins, only one nesting order is possible.
#
# For the following query, the optimizer evaluates two different nestings.
# In both nestings, T1 must be processed in the outer loop because it is used in an outer join.
#
# T2 and T3 are used in an inner join, so that join must be processed in the inner loop.
# However, because the join is an inner join, T2 and T3 can be processed in either order.
#
# SELECT * T1 LEFT JOIN (T2,T3) ON P1(T1,T2) AND P2(T1,T3)
# 		WHERE P(T1,T2,T3)
#
# One nesting evluates T2, then T3:
#
# 		FOR each row t1 in T1 {
# 			BOOL f1:=FALSE;
# 			FOR each row t2 in T2 such that P1(t1,t2) {
# 				FOR each row t3 in T3 such that P2(t1,t3) {
# 					IF P(t1,t2,t3) {
# 						t:=t1||t2||t3; OUTPUT t;
# 					}
# 					f1:=TRUE
# 				}
# 			}
# 			IF (!f1) {
# 				IF P(t1,NULL,NULL) {
# 					t:=t1||NULL||NULL; OUTPUT t;
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
#
# The other nesting evaluates T3, then T2:
#
# 		FOR each row t1 in T1 {
# 			BOOL f1:=FALSE;
# 			FOR each row t3 in T3 such that P2(t1,t3) {
# 				FOR each row t2 in T2 such that P1(t1,t2) {
# 					IF P(t1,t2,t3) {
# 						t:=t1||t2||t3; OUTPUT t;
# 					}
# 					f1:=TRUE
# 				}
# 			}
# 			IF (!f1) {
# 				IF P(t1,NULL,NULL) {
# 					t:=t1||NULL||NULL; OUTPUT t;
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
#
# When discussing the nested-loop algorithm for inner joins, we omitted some details whose impact
# on the performance of query execution may be huge.
#
# We did not mentioned so-called "Pushed down" conditions. Suppose that our WHERE condition P(T1,T2,T3) can be
# represented by a conjunctive formula:
#
# P(T1,T2,T2) = C1(T1) AND C2(T2) AND C3(T3)
#
# In this case, MySQl actually uses the following nested-loop algorithm for the execution of the query
# with inner joins:
#
# 		FOR each row t1 in T1 such that C1(t1) {
# 			FOR each row t2 in T2 such that P1(t1,t2) AND C2(t2) {
# 				FOR each row t3 in T3 such that P2(t2,t3) AND C3(t3) {
# 					IF P(t1,t2,t3) {
# 						t:=t1||t2||t3; OUTPUT t;
# 					}
# 				}
# 			}
# 		}
#
# You see that each of the conjuncts C1(T1), C2(T2), C3(T3) are pushed out for the most inner loop to the
# most outer loop where it can be evaluated.
#
# If C1(T1) is a very restrictive condition, this condition pushdown may greatly reduce te number of rows
# from table T1 passed to the inner loops.
#
# As a result, the execution time for the query may improve immensely.
#
# For a query with outer joins, the WHERE condition is to be checked only after it has been found that the
# current row from the outer table has a match in the inner tables.
#
# Thus, the optimization of pushing conditions out of the inner nested loops cannot be applied directly
# to queries with outer joins.
#
# Here we must introduce conditional pushed-down predicates guarded by the flags that are turned on
# when a match has been encountered.
#
# Recall this example with outer joins:
#
# 		P(T1,T2,T3)=C1(T1) AND C(T2) AND C3(T3)
#
# For that example, the nested-loop algorithm using guarded pushed-down conditions looks like this:
#
# 		FOR each row t1 in T1 such that C1(t1) {
# 			BOOL f1:=FALSE;
# 			FOR each row t2 in T2
# 					such that P1(t1,t2) AND (f1?C2(t2):TRUE) {
# 				BOOL f2:=FALSE;
# 				FOR each row t3 in T3
# 						such that P2(t2,t3) AND (f1&&f2?C3(t3):TRUE) {
# 					IF (f1&&f2?TRUE:(C2(t2) AND C3(t3))) {
# 						t:=t1||t2||t3; OUTPUT t;
# 					}
# 					f2=TRUE;
# 					f1=TRUE;
# 				}
# 				IF (!f2) {
# 					IF (f1?TRUE:C2(t2) && P(t1,t2,NULL)) {
# 						t:=t1||t2||NULL; OUTPUT t;
# 					}
# 					f1=TRUE;
# 				}
# 			}
# 			IF (!f1 && P(t1, NULL, NULL)) {
# 				t:=t1||NULL||NULL; OUTPUT t;
# 			}
# 		}
#
# In general, pushed-down predicates can be extracted from join conditions such as P1(T1,T2) and P(T2,T3).
#
# In this case, a pushed-down predicate is guarded also by a flag that prevents checking the predicate
# for the NULL-complemented row generated by the corresponding outer join operation.
#
# Access by key from one inner table to another in the same nested join is prohibited if it is induced
# by a predicate from the WHERE condition.
#
# OUTER JOIN OPTIMIZATION
#
# Outer joins include LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN
#
# MySQL implements an A LEFT JOIN B join_condition as follows:
#
# 		) Table B is set to depend on table A and all tables on which A depends
#
# 		) Table A is set to depend on all tables (except B) that are used in the LEFT JOIN condition.
#
# 		) The LEFT JOIN condition is used to decide how to retrieve rows from table B (In other words, any condition in the WHERE clause is not used)
#
# 		) All standard join optimizations are performed, with the exception that a table is always read after all tables on which it depends.
# 			If there is a circular dependency, an error occurs.
#
# 		) All standard WHERE optimizations are performed.
#
# 		) If there is a row in A that matches the WHERE clause, but there is no row in B that matches the ON condition, an extra B row is generated
# 			with all columns set to NULL.
#
# 		) If you use LEFT JOIN to find rows that do not exist in some table and you have the following test: col_name is NULL in the WHERE part,
# 			where col_name is a column that is declared as NOT NULL, MySQL stops searching for more rows (for a particular key combination) after
# 			it has found one row that matches the LEFT JOIN condition.
#
# The RIGHT JOIN implementation is analogous to that of LEFT JOIN with the table roles reversed.
# Right joins are converted to equivalent left joins, as described later.
#
# For a LEFT JOIN, if the WHERE condition is always false for the generated NULL row, the LEFT JOIN is changed to an inner join.
# For example, the WHERE clause would be false in the following query if t2.column1 were NULL:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON (column1) WHERE t2.column2=5;
#
# Therefore, it is safe to convert the query to an inner join:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t2.column2=5 AND t1.column1=t2.column1;
#
# Now the optimizer can use table t2 before table t1 if doing so would result in a better query plan.
# To provide a hint about the table join order, use optimizer hints; see later.
#
# Alternatively, use STRAIGHT_JOIN; see later.
#
# However, STRAIGHT_JOIN may prevent indexes from being used because it disables semi-join transformations.
# See later.
#
# OUTER JOIN SIMPLIFICATION
#
# Table expressions in the FROM clause of a query are simplified in many cases.
#
# At the parser stage, queries with right outer join operations are converted to equivalent queries containing
# only left join operations.
#
# In the general case, the conversion is performed such that this right join:
#
# 		(T1, ---) RIGHT JOIN (T2, ---) ON P(T1, ---, T2, ---)
#
# Becomes this equivalent left join:
#
# 		(T2, ---) LEFT JOIN (T1, ---) ON P(T1, ---, T2, ---)
#
# ALl inner join expressions of the form T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON P(T1,T2) are replaced by the list
# T1,T2,P(T1,T2) being joined as a conjunct to the WHERE condition (or to the join condition of the embedding join, if there is any)
#
# When the optimizer evaluates plans for outer join operations, it takes into consideration only plans where,
# for each such operation, the outer tables are accessed before the inner tables.
#
# The optimizer choices are limited because only such plans enable outer joins to be executed using the nested-loop algorithm.
#
# Consider a query of this form, where R(T2) greatly narrows the number of matching rows from table t2:
#
# 		SELECT * T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON P1(T1,T2)
# 			WHERE P(T1,T2) AND R(T2)
#
# If the query is executed as written, the optimizer has no choice but to access the less-restricted table T1
# before the more-restricted table T2, which may produce a very inefficient execution plan.
#
# Instead, MySQL converts the query to a query with no outer join operation if the WHERE condition is 
# null-rejected.
#
# (That is, it converts the outer join to an inner join)
#
# A condition is said to be null-rejected for an outer join operation if it evaluates to FALSE
# or UNKNOWN for any NULL-complemented row generated for the operation.
#
# Thus, for this outer join:
#
# 		T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.A=T2.A
#
# Conditions such as these are null-rejected because they cannot be true for any NULL-complemented row
# (with T2 columns set to NULL):
#
# 		T2.B IS NOT NULL
# 		T2.B > 3
# 		T2.C <= T1.C
# 		T2.B < 2 OR T2.C > 1
#
# Conditions such as these are not null-rejected because they might be true for a NULL-complemented row:
#
# 		T2.B IS NULL
# 		T1.B < 3 OR T2.B IS NOT NULL
# 		T1.B < 3 OR T2.B > 3
#
# The general rules for checking whether a condition is null-rejected for an outer join operation are simple:
#
# 	) It is of the form A IS NOT NULL, where A is an attribute of any of the inner tables
#
# 	) It is a predicate containing a reference to an inner table that evaluates to UNKNOWN when one of its arguments
# 		is NULL
#
# 	) It is a conjunction a null-rejected condition as a conjunct
#
# 	) It is a disjunction of null-rejected conditions
#
# A condition can be null-rejected for one outer join operation in a query and not null-rejected for another.
#
# In this query,the WHERE condition is null-rejected for the second outer join operation but is not null-rejected
# for the first one:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T2.A=T1.A
# 							  LEFT JOIN T3 ON T3.B=T1.B
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0
#
# If the WHERE condition is null-rejected for an outer join operation in a query, the outer join operation is replaced
# by an inner join operation.
#
# For example, in the preceding query, the second outer join is null-rejected and can be replaced by an inner join:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T2.A=T1.A
# 								INNER JOIN T3 ON T3.B=T1.B
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0
#
# For the original query, the optimizer evaluates only plans compatible with the single table-access order
# T1,T2,T3.
#
# For the rewritten query, it aditionally considers the access order T3,T1,T2
#
# A conversion of one outer join operation may trigger a conversion of another. Thus, the query:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T2.A=T1.A
# 							  LEFT JOIN T3 ON T3.B=T2.B
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0
#
# Is first converted to the query:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T2.A=T1.A
# 								INNER JOIN T3 ON T3.B=T2.B
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0
#
# Which is equivalent to the query:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM (T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T2.A=T1.A), T3
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0 AND T3.B=T2.B
#
# The remaining outer join operation can also be replaced by an inner join because
# the condition T3.B=T2.B is null-rejected.
#
# This results in a query with no outer joins at all:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM (T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON T2.A=T1.A), T3
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0 AND T3.B=T2.B
#
# Sometimes the optimizer succeeds in replacing an embedded outer join operation, but cannot
# convert the embedding outer join.
#
# The following query:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN
# 							(T2 LEFT JOIN T3 ON T3.B=T2.B)
# 							ON T2.A=T1.A
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0
#
# Is converted to:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN
# 							(T2 INNER JOIN T3 ON T3.B=T2.B)
# 							ON T2.A=T1.A
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0
#
# That can be rewritten only to the form still containing the embedding outer join operation:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN
# 							(T2,T3)
# 							ON (T2.A=T1.A AND T3.B=T2.B)
# 			WHERE T3.C > 0
#
# Any attempt to convert an embedded outer join operation in a query must take into account the
# join condition for the embedding outer join together with the WHERE condition.
#
# In this query, the WHERE condition is not null-rejected for the embedded outer join,
# but the join condition of the embedding outer join T2.A=T1.A AND T3.C=T1.C is null-rejected:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN
# 							(T2 LEFT JOIN T3 ON T3.B=T2.B)
# 							ON T2.A=T1.A AND T3.C=T1.C
# 			WHERE T3.D > 0 OR T1.D > 0
#
# Consequently, the query can be converted to:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT JOIN
# 								(T2,T3)
# 								ON T2.A=T1.A AND T3.C=T1.C AND T3.B=T2.B
# 			WHERE T3.D > 0 OR T1.D > 0
#
# MULTI-RANGE READ OPTIMIZATION
#
# Reading rows using a range scan on a secondary index can result in many random disk accesses to the
# base table when the table is large and not stored in the storage engine's cache.
#
# With the Disk-Sweep Multi-Range Read (MRR) optimization, MySQL tries to reduce the number
# of random disk access for range scans by first scanning the index only and collecting the keys for the
# relevant rows.
#
# Then the keys are sorted and finally the rows are retrieved from the base table using the order
# of the primary key.
#
# The motivation for Disk-sweep MRR is to reduce the number of random disk accesses and instead achieve
# a more sequential scan of the base table data.
#
# The Multi-Range Read optimization provides these benefits:
#
# 		) MRR enables data rows to be accessed sequentially rather than in random order, based on index tuples.
#
# 			The server obtains a set of index tuples that satisfy the query conditions, sorts them according
# 			to data row ID order, and uses the sorted tuples to retrieve data rows in order.
#
# 			This makes data access more efficient and less expensive.
#
# 		) MRR enables batch processing of requests for key access for operations that require access to data rows
# 			through index tuples, such as range index scans and equi-joins that use an index for the join attribute.
#
# 			MRR iterates over a sequence of index ranges to obtain qualifying index tuples.
#
# 			As these results accumulate, they are used to access the corresponding data rows.
# 			It is not necessary to acquire all index tuples before starting to read data rows.
#
# THe MRR optimization is not supported with secondary indexes created on virtual generated columns.
# InnoDB supports secondary indexes on virtual generated columns.
#
# The following scenarios illustrate when MRR optimization can be advantageous:
#
# SCENARIO A: MRR can be used for InnoDB and MyISAM tables for index range scans and equi-join operations.
#
# 		1. A portion of the index tuples are accumulated in a buffer.
#
# 		2. The tuples in the buffer are sorted by their data row ID.
#
# 		3. Data rows are accessed according to the sorted index tuple sequence.
#
# SCENARIO B: MRR can be used for NDB tables for multiple-range index scans or when performing
# 					an equi-join by an attribute.
#
# 		1. A portion of ranges, possibly single-key ranges, is accumulated in a buffer on the central node where
# 				the query is submitted.
#
# 		2. The ranges are sent to the execution nodes that access data rows.
#
# 		3. The accessed rows are packed into packages and sent back to the central node.
#
# 		4. The received packages with data rows are placed in a buffer.
#
# 		5. Data rows are read from the buffer.
#
# When MRR is used, the Extra column in EXPLAIN output shows Using MRR.
#
# InnoDB and MyISAM do not use MRR if full table rows need not be accessed to produce the query result.
#
# This is the case if results can be produced entirely on the basis on information in the index tuples (through a covering index); 
# MRR provides no benefit.
#
# Two optimizer_switch system variable flags provide an interface to the use of MRR optimization.
# The mrr flag controls whether MRR is enabled.
#
# If mrr is enabled (on), the mrr_cost_based flag controls whether the optimizer attempts to make
# a cost-based choice between using and not using MRR (on) or uses MRR whenever possible (off).
#
# By default, mrr is on and mrr_cost_based is on. More later.
#
# For MRR, a storage engine uses the value of the read_rnd_buffer_size system variable as a guideline
# for how much memory it can allocate for its buffer.
#
# The engine uses up to read_rnd_buffer_size bytes and determines the number of ranges to process in a single pass.
#
# BLOCK NESTED-LOOP AND BATCHED KEY ACCESS JOINS
#
# In MySQL, a Batched Key Access (BKA) join algorithm is available that uses both index access to the joined
# table and a join buffer.
#
# The BKA algorithm supports inner join, outer join, and semi-join operations, including nested outer joins.
# Benefits of BKA include improved join performance due to more efficient table scanning.
#
# Also, the Block Nested-Loop (BNL) join algorithm previously used only for inner joins is extended
# and can be employed for outer join and semi-join operations, including nested outer joins.
#
# The following section discuss the join buffer management that underlies the extension of the original
# BNL algorithm, the extended BNL algorithm, and the BKA algorithm.
#
# For information about semi-join strategies, see later.
#
# JOIN BUFFER MANAGEMENT FOR BLOCK NESTED-LOOP AND BATCHED KEY ACCESS ALGORITHMS
#
# MySQL can employ join buffers to execute not only inner joins without index access to the
# inner table, but also outer joins and semi-joins that appear after subquery flattening.
#
# Moreover, a join buffer can be effectively used when there is an index access to the inner table.
#
# The join buffer management code slightly more effectively utilizes join buffer space when storing
# the values of the interesting row columns: No additional bytes are allocated in buffers for a row
# column if its value is NULL, and the minimum number of bytes is allocated for any value
# of the VARCHAR type.
#
# The code supports two types of buffers, regular and incremental.
#
# Suppose that join buffer B1 is employed to join tables t1 and t2 and the result
# of this operation is joined with table t3 using join buffer B2:
#
# 		) A regular join buffer contains columns from each join operand. If B2 is a regular join buffer,
# 			each row r put into B2 is composed of the columns of a row r1 from B1 and the interesting columns
# 			of a matching row r2 from table tb3.
#
# 		) An incremental join buffer contains only columns from rows of the table produced by the second join operand.
# 			That is, it is incremental to a row from the first operand buffer.
#
# 			If B2 is an incremental join buffer, it contains the interesting columns of the row r2 together with a link
# 			to the row r1 from B1.
#
# Incremental join buffers are always incremental relative to a join buffer from an earlier join operation,
# so the buffer from the first join operation is always a regular buffer.
#
# In the example just given, the buffer B1 used to join tables t1 and t2 must be a regular buffer.
#
# Each row of the incremental buffer used for a join operation contains only the interesting columns
# of a row from the table to be joined.
#
# These columns are augmented with a reference to the interesting columns of the matched row from the
# table produced by the first join operand.
#
# Several rows in the incremental buffer can refer to the same row r whose columns are stored in the
# previous join buffers insofar as all these rows match row r.
#
# Incremental buffers enable less frequent copying of columns from buffers used for previous join operations.
#
# This provides a savings in buffer space because in general case a row produced by the first join operand
# can be matched by several rows produced by the second join operand.
#
# It is unnesseary to make several copies of a row from the first operand.
#
# Incremental buffers also provide a savings in processing time due to the reduction in copying time.
#
# The block_nested_loop and batched_key_access flags of the optimizer_switch system variable control how
# the optimizer uses the Block Nested-Loop and Batched Key Access join algorithms.
#
# By default, block_nested_loop is on and batched_key_access is off.
#
# Optimizer hints may also be applied.
#
# More on this and Switchable Optimizations, later.
#
# For info about semi-join operations, more on that later.
#
# BLOCK NESTED-LOOP ALGORITHM FOR OUTER JOINS AND SEMI-JOINS
#
# The original implementation of the MySQL BNL algorithm is extended to support outer join and semi-join operations.
#
# When these operations are executed with a join buffer, each row put into the buffer is supplied with a match flag.
#
# If an outer join operation is executed using a join buffer, each row of the table produced by the second
# operand is checked for a match against each row in the join buffer.
#
# When a match is found, a new extended row is formed (the original row plus columns from the second operand)
# and sent for further extensions by the remaining join operations.
#
# In addition, the match flag of the matched row in the buffer is enabled.
#
# After all rows of the table to be joined have been examined, the join buffer is scanned.
#
# Each row from the buffer that does not have its match flag enabled is extended by NULL complements
# (NULL values for each column in the second operand) and sent for further extensions by the remaining
# join operations.
#
# The block_nested_loop flag of the optimizer_switch System variable controls how the optimizer uses the
# Block Nested-Loop algorithm. By default, block_nested_loop is on.
#
# More on this later, in tandem with Optimizer hints.
#
# In EXPLAIN output, use of BNL for a table is signified when the Extra value contains Using join buffer
# (Block Nested Loop) and the type value is ALL, index or range.
#
# For info about semi-join strats, more later.
#
# BATCHED KEY ACCESS JOINS
#
# MySQL implements a method of joining tables called the Batched Key Access (BKA) join algorithm.
# BKA can be applied when there is an index access to the table produced by the second
# join operand.
#
# Like the BNL join algorithm, the BKA join algorithm employs a join buffer to accumulate the interesting
# columns of the rows produced by the first operand of the join operation.
#
# Then the BKA algorithm builds keys to access the table to be joined for all rows in the buffer
# and submits these keys in a batch to the database engine for index lookups.
#
# The keys are submitted to the engine through the Multi-Range Read (MRR) interface.
#
# After submission of the keys, the MRR engine functions perform lookups in the index in an optimal
# way, fetching the rows of the joined table found by these keys and starts feeding the
# BKA join algorithm with matching rows.
#
# Each matching row is coupled with a reference to a row in the join buffer.
#
# When BKA is used, the value of join_buffer_size defines how large the batch of keys is in each request
# to the storage engine.
#
# The larger the buffer, the more sequential access will be to the right hand table of a join operation,
# which can significantly improve performance.
#
# For BKA to be used, the batched_key_access flag of the optimizer_switch system variable must be set to on.
# BKA uses MRR, so the mrr flag must also be on.
#
# Currently, the cost estimation for MRR is too pessimistic. Hence, it is also nessecary for mrr_cost_based
# to be off for BKA to be used.
#
# The following settings enable BKA:
#
# SET optimizer_switch='mrr=on,mrr_cost_based=off,batched_key_access=on';
#
# There are two scenarios by which MRR functions execute:
#
# 		) The first scenario is used for conventional disk-based storage engines such as InnoDB and MyISAM.
#
# 			For these engines, usually the keys for all rows from the join buffer are submitted to the MRR interface
# 			at once.
#
# 			Engine-specific MRR functions perform index lookups for the submitted keys, get row IDs (or pimary keys)
# 			from them, and then fetch rows for all these selected row IDs one by one by request from BKA algorithm.
#
# 			Every row is returned with an association reference that enables access to the matched row in the join buffer.
# 			The rows are fetched by the MRR functions in an optimal way:
#
# 			They are fetched in the row ID (primary key) order.
#
# 			This improves performance because reads are in disk order rather than random order.
#
# 		) The second scenario is used for remote storage engines such as NDB.
#
# 			A package of keys for a portion of rows from the join buffer, together with their
# 			associations, is sent by a MySQL Server (SQL node) to MySQL Cluster data nodes.
#
# 			IN return, the SQL nodes receive a package (or several packages) of matching rows
# 			coupled with corresponding associations.
#
# 			The BKA join algorithm takes these rows and builds new joined rows.
#
# 			Then a new set of keys is sent to the data nodes and the rows from the returned packages
# 			are used to build new joined rows.
#
# 			The process continues until the last keys from the join buffer are sent to the data nodes,
# 			and the SQL node has received and joined all rows matching these keys.
#
# 			This improves performance because fewer key-bearing packages sent by the SQL node to the
# 			data nodes means fewer round trips between it and the data nodes to perform the join operation.
#
# With the first scenario, a portion of the join buffer is reserved to store row IDs (primary keys) selected by
# index lookups and passed as a parameter to the MRR functions.
#
# There is no special buffer to store keys built for rows from the join buffer. Instead, a function that builds
# the key for the next row in the buffer is passed as a parameter to the MRR functions.
#
# In EXPLAIN output, use of BKA for a table is signified when the Extra value contains Using join buffer (Batched Key Access)
# and the type value is ref or eq_ref.
#
# OPTIMIZER HINTS FOR BLOCK NESTED-LOOP AND BATCHED KEY ACCESS ALGORITHMS
#
# In addition to using the optimizer_switch system variable to control optimizer use of the BNL and BKA 
# algorithms session-wide,, MySQL supports optimizer hints to influence the optimizer on a per-statement basis.
#
# More on this later.
#
# To use a BNL or BKA hint to enable join buffering for any inner table of an outer join, join buffering must be enabled
# for all inner tables of the outer join.
#
# CONDITION FILTERING
#
# In join processing, prefix rows are those rows passed from one table in a join to the next.
#
# In general, the optimizer attempts to put tables with low prefix counts early in the join order
# to keep the number of row combinations from increasing rapidly.
#
# To the extent that the optimizer can use information about conditions on rows selected from one table
# and passed to the next, the more accurately it can compute row estimates and choose the best execution plan.
#
# Without condition filtering, the prefix row count for a table is based on the estimated number of rows selected
# by the WHERE clause according to whichever access method the optimizer chooses.
#
# Condition filtering enables the optimizer to use other relevant conditions in the WHERE clause not taken into
# account by the access method, and thus improve its prefix row count estimates.
#
# For example, even though there might be an index-based access method that can be used to select rows from
# the current table in a join, there might also be additional conditions for the table in the WHERE clause that
# can filter (further restrict) the estimate for qualifying rows passed to the next table.
#
# A condition contributes to the filtering estimates only if:
#
# 		) It refers to the current table.
#
# 		) It depends on a constant value or values from earlier tables in the join sequence.
#
# 		) It was not already taken into account by the access method.
#
# In EXPLAIN output, the rows column indicates the row estimate for the chosen access method,
# and the filtered column reflects the effect of condition filtering.
#
# Filtered values are expressed as percentages. The max  value is 100, which means no filtering
# of rows occurred.
#
# Values decreasing from 100 indicate increasing amounts of filtering.
#
# The prefix row count (the number of rows estimated to be passed from the current table in a join
# to the enxt) is the product of the rows and filtered values.
#
# that is, the prefix row count is the estimated row count, reduced by the estimated filtering effect.
# For example, if rows is 1000 and filtered is 20%, condition filtering reduces the esitmated row count
# of 1000 to a prefix row count of 1000 * 20% (1000 * .2) = 200
# 
# Consider the following query:
#
# 		SELECT * 
# 				FROM employee JOIN department ON employee.dept_no = department.dept_no
# 				WHERE employee.first_name='John'
# 				AND employee.hire_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-01';
#
# Suppose that the data set has these characteristics:
#
# 		) The employee table has 1024 rows.
#
# 		) The department table has 12 rows.
#
# 		) Both tables have an index of dept_no
#
# 		) The employee table has an index on first_name
#
# 		) 8 Rows satisfy this condition on employee.first_name:
#
# 			employee.first_name = 'John'
#
# 		) 150 rows satisfy this condition on employee.hire_date:
#
# 			employee.hire_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-01'
#
# 		) 1 row satisfies both conditions:
#
# 			employee.first_name = 'John'
# 			AND employee.hire_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-01'
#
# Without condition filtering, EXPLAIN produces output like this:
#
# 		+---+--------------------+---------------------+------------------------------+------------------+------------+------+------------------+
# 		|id | table 				 | type 					  | possible_keys 					| key 				 | ref 					| rows 	| filtered|
# 		+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 		| 1 | employee 			 | ref 					  | name, h_date, dept 				| name 				 | const 				| 8 		| 100.00  |
# 		| 1 | department 			 | eq_ref 				  | PRIMARY 							| PRIMARY 			 | dept_no 				| 1 		| 100.00  |
# 		+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# For employee, teh access method on the name index picks up the 8 rows that match a name of 'John'.
#
# No filtering is done (filtered is 100%), so all rows are prefix rows for the next table:
# 		The prefix row count is rows x filtered = 8 x 100% = 8
#
# With condition filtering, the optimizer additionaly takes into account conditions from the WHERE clause not taken into account by the
# access method.
#
# In this case, the optimizer uses heuristics to estimate a filtering effect of 16.31% for the BETWEEN condition on 
# employee.hire_date 
#
# As a result, EXPLAIN produces output like this:
#
# 		+---+------------------+---------------------+----------------------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------+---------------+
# 		|id | table 			  | type 					| possible_keys 	   | key 		  | ref 				  | rows 				| filtered 					  |
# 		+---+------------------+---------------------+--------------------+-------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------------------+
# 		|1  | employee 		  | ref 						| name, h_date, dept	|	name 		  | const 			  | 8 					| 16.31 						  |
# 		|1  | department 		  | eq_ref 					| PRIMARY 			   | PRIMARY 	  | dept_no 		  | 1 					| 100.00 					  |
# 		+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# Now the prefix row count is rows * filtered = 8 * 16.31 = 1.3, which more closely reflects the actual data set.
#
# Normally, the optimizer does not calcualate the condition filtering effect (prefix row count reduction) for the last joined table
# because there is no next table to pass rows to.
#
# An exception occurs for EXPLAIN: To provide more information, the filtering effect is calculated for all joined tables, including the last one.
#
# To control whether the optimizer considers additional filtering conditions, use the condition_fanout_filter flag of the optimizer_switch system
# variable (see later)
#
# This flag is enabled by default but can be disabled to suppress condition filtering (for example, if a particular query is found to yield better
# performance without it)
#
# If the optimizer overestimates the effect of condition filtering, performance may be worse than if condition filtering is not used.
# In such cases, these tehcniques help:
#
# 		) If a column is not indexed, index it so that the optimizer has some information about the distribution of column values and can improve its row estimates.
#
# 		) SImilarly, if no column histogram information is available, generate a histogram (see more later)
#
# 		) Change the join order. Ways to accomplish this includes join-order optimizer hints (see later), STRAIGHT_JOIN immediately following the
# 			SELECT, and the STRAIGHT_JOIN join operator.
#
# 		) Disable condition filtering for the session:
#
# 			SET optimizer_switch = 'condition_fanout_filter=off';
#
# 		Or, for a given query, using an optimizer hint:
#
# 			SELECT /*+ SET_VAR(optimizer_switch = 'condition_fanout_filter=off') */
#
# IS NULL OPTIMIZATION
#
# MySQL can perform the same optimization on col_name IS_NULL that it can use for col_name = constant_value.
# FOr example, MySQL can use indexes and ranges to search for NULL with IS_NULL.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col IS NULL;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col <=> NULL;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name 
# 			WHERE key_col=const1 OR key_col=const2 OR key_col IS NULL;
#
# If a WHERE clause includes a col_name IS_NULL condition for a column that is declared as NOT NULL, that expression is optimized away.
#
# This optimization does not occur in cases where the column might produce NULL anyway; for example, if it comes from a table on
# the right side of a LEFT JOIN.
#
# MySQL can also optimize the combination col_name = expr OR col_name IS NULL, a form that is common in resolved subqueries.
#
# EXPLAIN shows ref_or_null when this optimization is used.
#
# THis optimization can handle one IS_NULL for any key part.
#
# Some examples of queries that are optimized, assuming that there is an index on columns a and b of table t2:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a=expr OR t1.a IS NULL;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2
# 			WHERE (t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL) AND t2.b=t1.b;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2
# 			WHERE t1.a=t2.a AND (t2.b=t1.b OR t2.b IS NULL);
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2
# 			WHERE (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ---)
# 			OR (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ---);
#
# ref_or_null works by first doing a read on the reference key, and then a separate search for rows
# with a NULL key value.
#
# THe optimization can handle only one IS_NULL level.
#
# IN the following query, MYSQL uses key lookups only on the expression (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL) and is not
# able to use the key part on b:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1, t2
# 			WHERE (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL)
# 			OR (t1.b=t2.b AND t2.b IS NULL);
#
# ORDER BY OPTIMIZATION
#
# This section describes when MySQL can use an index to satisfy an ORDER BY clause, the filesort
# operation used when an index cannot be used and execution plan information available
# from the optimizer about ORDER BY.
#
# An ORDER BY with and without LIMIT may return rows in different orders, as discussed later.
#
# USE OF INDEXES TO SATISFY ORDER BY
#
# In some cases, MYSQL may use an index to satisfy an ORDER BY clause and avoid the extra sorting
# involved in performing a filesort operation.
#
# The index may also be used even if the ORDER BY does not match the index exactly,
# as long as all unused portions of the index and all extra ORDER BY columns are constants in
# the WHERE clause.
#
# If the index does not contain all columns accessed by the query, the index is used only if index access
# is cheaper than other access methods.
#
# Assuming that there is an index on (key_part1, key_part2), the following queries may use the index
# to resolve the ORDER BY part.
#
# Whether the optimizer actually does so depends on whether reading the index is more efficient than a table
# scan if columns not in the index must also be read.
#
# 		) In this query, teh index on (key_part1, key_part2) enables the optimizer to avoid sorting:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM t1
# 				ORDER BY key_part1, key_part2;
#
# 			However, the query uses SELECT *, which may select more columns than key_part1 and key_part2.
#
# 			In that case, scanning an entire index and looking up table rows to find columns not in the index
# 			may be more expensive than scanning the table and sorting the results.
#
# 			If so, the optimizer probably will not use the index.
#
# 			If SELECT * selects only the index columns, the index will be used and sorting avoided.
#
# 			If t1 is an InnoDB table, the table primary key is implicitly part of the index, and the index can be used to
# 			resolve the ORDER BY for this query:
#
# 				SELECT pk, key_part1, key_part2 FROM t1
# 					ORDER BY key_part1, key_part2;
#
# 		) In this query, key_part1 is constant, so all rows accessed through the index are in key_part2 order,
# 			and an index on (key_part1, key_part2) avoids sorting if the WHERE clause is selective enough
# 			to make an index range scan cheaper than a table scan:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM t1
# 				WHERE key_part1 = constant
# 				ORDER BY key_part2;
#
# 		) In the next two queries, whether the index is used similar to the same queries without DESC shown prev.:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM t1
# 				ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 DESC;
#
# 			SELECT * FROM t1
# 				WHERE key_part1 = constant
# 				ORDER BY key_part2 DESC;
#
# 		) Two columns in an ORDER BY can sort in the same direction (both ASC or both DESC), or in opposite directions (one ASC, one DESC).
#
# 			A condition for index use is that the index must have the same homoegeneity, but need not have the same actual direction.
#
# 			If a query mixes ASC and DESC, the optimizer can use an index on the columns if the index also uses corresponding
# 			mixed ascending and descending columns:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1
# 					ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 ASC;
#
# 			The optimizer can use an index on (key_part1, key_part2) if key_part1 is desc and key_part2 is asc.
# 			It can also use an index on those columns (with a backward scan) if key_part1 is asc and key_part2 is desc.
#
# 			More on this later.
#
# 		) In the next two queries, key_part1 is compared to a constant. The index will be used if the WHERE clause is
# 			selective enough to make an index range scan cheaper than a table scan:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1
# 					WHERE key_part1 > constant
# 					ORDER BY key_part1 ASC;
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1
# 					WHERE key_part1 < constant
# 					ORDER BY key_part1 DESC;
#
# 		) In the next query, teh ORDER BY does not name key_part1, but all rows selected have a constant key_part1 value,
# 			so the index can still be used:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1
# 					WHERE key_part1 = constant1 AND key_part2 > constant2
# 					ORDER BY key_part2;
#
# 			In some cases, MySQL cannot use indexes to resolve the ORDER BY, although it may still use indexes to find the rows that
# 			match the WHERE clause.
#
# 			Examples:
#
# 				) The query uses ORDER BY on different indexes:
#
# 					SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key1, key2;
#
# 				) The query uses ORDER BY on nonconsecutive parts of an index:
#
# 					SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key1_part1, key1_part3;
#
# 				) The index used to fetch the rows differs from the one used in the ORDER BY:
#
# 					SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key1;
#
# 				) The query uses ORDER BY with an expression that includes terms other than the index column name:
#
# 					SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY ABS(key);
# 					SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY -key;
#
# 				) The query joins many tables, and the columns in the ORDER BY are not all from the first nonconstant table that is used
# 					to retrieve rows.
#
# 					(This is the first table in the EXPLAIN output that does not have a const join type)
#
# 				) The query has a different ORDER BY and GROUP BY expressions.
#
# 				) There is an index on only a prefix of a column named in the ORDER BY clause.
#
# 					IN this case, the index cannot be used to fully resolve the sort order.
#
# 					For example, if only the first 10 bytes of CHAR(20) column are indexed, the index cannot
# 					distinguish values past the 10th byte and a filesort is needed.
#
# 				) The index does not store rows in order. For example, this is true for a HASH index in a MEMORY table.
#
# Availability of an index for sorting may be affected by the use of column aliases.
#
# Suppose that the column t1.a is indexed.
#
# In this statement, the name of the column in the select list is a.
#
# It refers to t1.a, as does the reference to a in teh ORDER BY, so the index
# on t1.a can be used:
#
# 	SELECT a FROM t1 ORDER BY a;
#
# In this statement, the name of the column in the select list is also a, but it is the alias name.
#
# It refers to ABS(a), as does the reference to a in the ORDER BY, so the index on t1.a cannot be used:

# SELECT ABS(a) AS a FROM t1 ORDER BY a;
#
# In the following statemnet, the ORDER BY refers to a name that is not hte name of a column in the select list.
#
# But there is a column in t1 named a, so the ORDER BY refers to t1.a and the index on t1.a can be used.
# (The resulting sort order may be completely different from the order for ABS(a), of course)
#
# SELECT ABS(a) AS b FROM t1 ORDER BY a;
#
# < 5.7, GROUP BY sorted implicitly under certain conditions.
#
# Howver, in >= 8.0, that no longer occurs, so specifying ORDER BY NULL at the end to suppress implicit
# sorting (as was doine previously), is no longer called for.
#
# However, query results may differ from previous MySQL versions.
#
# To produce a given sort order, provide an ORDER BY clause.
#
# USE OF FILESORT TO SATISFY ORDER BY
#
# If an index cannot be used to satisfy an ORDER BY clause, MySQL performs a filesort operation that
# reads table rows and sorts them.
#
# A filesort constitutes an extra sorting phase in query execution.
#
# To obtain memory for filtersort operations, as of 8.0.12, the optimizer allocates memory buffers
# incrementally as needed, up to the size indicated by the sort_buffer_size system variable, rather than
# allocating a fixed amount of sort_buffer_size bytes up front, as was done pre 8.0.12
#
# This enables users to set sort_buffer_size to large values to speed up large sorts, without concern
# for excessive memory use for small sorts.
#
# (This benefit may not occur for multiple concurrent sorts on WIndows, which has a weak multithreaded malloc)
#
# A filesort operation uses temporary disk files as nessecary if the result is set too large to fit in memory.
#
# Some types of queries are particularly suited to completely in-memory filesort operations.
#
# For example, the optimizer can use filesort to efficiently handle in memory, without temporary files, the ORDER BY
# operation for queries (and subqueries) of the following form:
#
# 		SELECT_---_FROM single_table ___ ORDER BY non_index_column [DESC] LIMIT [M,]N;
#
# SUch queries are common in web applications that display only a few rows from a larger result set.
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT col1, --- FROM t1 --- ORDER BY name LIMIT 10;
# 		SELECT col1, --- FROM t1 --- ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 15;
#
# INFLUENCING ORDER BY OPTIMIZATION
#
# For slow ORDER BY queries for which filesort is not used, try lowering the max_length_for_sort_data system variable
# to a value that is appropriate to trigger a filesort.
#
# (a symptom of setting the value of this variable too hgih is a combination of high disk activity and low CPU activity)
# 
# To increase ORDER BY speed, check whether you can get MySQL to use indexes rather than an extra sorting phase.
# If this is not possible, try the following strategies:
#
# 		) Increase the sort_buffer_size variable value.
#
# 			Ideally, the value should be large enough for the entire result set to fit in the sort buffer
# 			(to avoid writes to disk and merge passes)
#
# 			Take into account that hte size of column values stored in the sort buffer is affected by the
# 			max_sort_length system variable value.
#
# 			For example, if tuples store values of long string columns and you increase the value of max_sort_length
# 			, the size of sort buffer tuples increases as well and may require you to increase sort_buffer_size
#
# 			To monitor the number of merge passes (to merge temporary files), check the Sort_merge_passes status variable.
#
# 		) increase the read_rnd_buffer_size variable value so that more rows are read at a time.
#
# 		) Change the tmpdir system variable to point to a dedicated file system with large amounts of free space.
#
# 			The variable value can list several paths that are used in round-robin fashion; you cna use this feature
# 			to spread the load across several directories.
#
# 			Separate the paths by colon characters (:) on UNIX and semicolon chars on Windows (;).
#
# 			The paths should name directories in file systems located on different physical disks, not different partitions on the same disk.
#
# ORDER BY EXECUTION PLAN INFORMATION AVAILABLE
#
# With EXPLAIN (more later), you can check whether MySQL can use indexes to resolve an ORDER BY clause:
#
# 		) If the Extra column of EXPLAIN output does not contain Using filesort, the index is used and a filesort is not performed.
#
# 		) If the Extra column of EXPLAIN output contains Using filesort, the index is not used and a filesort is performed.
#
# In addition, if a filesort is performed, optimizer trace output includes a filesort_summary block.
# For example:
#
# 		"filesort_summary": {
# 			"rows": 100,
# 			"examined_rows": 100,
# 			"number_of_tmp_files": 0,
# 			"peak_memory_used": 25192,
# 			"sort_mode": "<sort_key, packed_additional_fields>"
# 		}
#
# peak_memory_used indicates the maximum memory used at any one time during the sort.
#
# This is a value up to but not nessecarily as large as the value of the sort_buffer_size system variable.
# Prior to 8.0.12, the output shows sort_buffer_size instead, indicating the value of sort_buffer_size.
#
# < 8.0.12, optimizer always allocates sort_buffer_size bytes for the sort buffer.
#
# >= 8.0.12, the optimizer allocates sort-buffer memory incrementally, beginning with
# a small amount and adding more as necessary, up to sort_buffer_size bytes)
#
# The sort_mode value provides information about the contents of tuples in the sort buffer:
#
# 		) <sort_key, rowid>: This indicates that sort buffer tuples are pairs that contain the sort key value and row ID
# 									of the original table row. Tuples are sorted by sort key value and the row ID is used to read the row from the table.
#
# 		) <sort_key, additional_fields>: This indicates that sort buffer tuples contain the sort key value and columns referenced by the query.
#
# 													Tuples are sorted by sort key value nad column values are read directly from the tuple.
#
# 		) <sort_key, packed_additional_fields>: Like the previous variant, but the additional columns are packed tightly together instead of using
# 																a fixed-length encoding.
#
# EXPLAIN does not distinguish whether the optimizer does or does not perform a filesort in memory.
# Use of an in-memory filesort can be seen in optimizer trace output.
#
# Look for filesort_priority_queue_optimization. For info about the optimizer trace, see later.
#
# GROUP BY OPTIMIZATION
#
# The most general way to satisfy a GROUP BY clause is to scan the whole table and create a new temporary table
# where all rows from each group are consecutive and then use this temporary table to discover groups and apply
# aggregate functions (if any).
#
# In some cases, MySQL is able to do much better than that and avoid creation of temp tables by using index access.
#
# The most important preconditions for using indexes for GROUP BY are that all GROUP BY columns reference attributes
# from the same index, and that the index stores its keys in order (as is true, for example, for a BTREE index, but not for a HASH index).
#
# Whether use of temporary tables can be replaced by index access also depends on which parts of an index are used in a query,
# the conditions specified for these parts, and the selected aggregate functions.
#
# There are two ways to execute a GROUP BY query through index access, as detailed in teh following sections.
#
# The first method applies the grouping operation together with all range predicates (if any).
# The second method first performs a range scan, and then groups the resulting tuples.
#
# Loose index scan can also be used in the absence of GROUP BY under some conditions. More on this later.
#
# LOOSE INDEX SCAN
#
# The most efficient way to process GROUP BY is when an index is used to directly retrieve the grouping columns.
#
# With this access method, MySQL uses the property of some index types that the keys are ordered
# (for example, BTREE).
#
# This property enables use of lookup groups in an index without having to consider all keys in the index
# that satisfy all WHERE conditions.
#
# This access method considers only a fraction of the keys in an index, so it is called a Loose Index Scan.
#
# When there is no WHERE clause, a Loose Index Scan reads as many keys as the numebr of groups, which may be
# much smaller than that of all keys.
#
# If the WHERE clause contains range predicates (see the discussion of the range join type later),
# a Loose Index Scan looks up the first key of each group that satisfies the range conditions and again
# reads the smallest possible number of keys.
#
# This is possible under the following conditions:
#
# 		) The query is over a single table
#
# 		) The  GROUP BY names only columns that form a leftmost prefix of the index and no other columns.
#
# 			(If, instead of GROUP BY, the query has a DISTINCT clause, all distinct attributes refer to columns that
# 				form a leftmost prefix of the index)
#
# 			For example, if a table t1 has an index on (c1, c2, c3), Loose Index Scan is applicable if the query
# 			has GROUP BY c1,c 2.
#
# 			It is not applicable if the query has GROUP BY c2, c3 (the columns are not a leftmost prefix), or GROUP BY c1, c2, c4 (c4 is not in the index)
#
# 		) The only aggregate functions used in the select list (if any) are MIN() and MAX(), and all of them refer
# 			to the same column.
#
# 			The column must be in the index and must immediately follow the columns in the GROUP BY.
#
# 		) ANy other parts of the index than those from the GROUP BY referenced in teh query must be constants (that is, they must
# 			be referenced in equalities with constants), except for the argument of MIN() or MAX() functions.
#
# 		) For columns in the index, full column values must be indexed, not just a prefix.
#
# 			for example, with c1 VARCHAR(20), INDEX (c1(10)), the index uses only a prefix of c1 values
# 			and cannot be used for Loose Index Scan
#
# If Loose Index Scan is applicable to a query, the EXPLAIN output shows Using index for group-by in the Extra column.
#
# Assume that there is an index idx(c1, c2, c3) on table t1(c1, c2, c3, c4).
#
# The Loose Index Scan access method can be used for the following queries:
#
# 		SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 GROUP BY c1, c2;
# 		SELECT DISTINCT c1, c2 FROM t1;
# 		SELECT c1, MIN(c2) FROM t1 GROUP BY c1;
# 
# 		SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 < const GROUP BY c1, c2;
# 		SELECT MAX(c3), MIN(c3), c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c2 > const GROUP BY c1, c2;
#
# 		SELECT c2 FROM t1 WHERE c1 < const GROUP BY c1, c2;
# 		SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE c3 = const GROUP BY c1, c2;
#
# The following queries cannot be executed with this quick select method, for the reasons given:
#
# 		) There are aggregate functions other than MIN() or MAX():
#
# 			SELECT c1, SUM(c2) FROM t1 GROUP BY c1;
#
# 		) The columns in the GROUP BY clause do not form a leftmost prefix of the index:
#
# 			SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 GROUP BY c2, c3;
#
# 		) The query refers to a part of a key that comes after the GROUP BY part, and for which there is no equality with a constant:
#
# 			SELECT c1, c3 FROM t1 GROUP BY c1, c2;
#
# 			Were the query to include WHERE c3 = const, Loose Index Scan could be used.
#
# The Loose Index Scan access method can be applied to other forms of aggregate function references in teh select list,
# in addition to the MIN() and MAX() references already supported:
#
# 		) AVG(DISTINCT), SUM(DISTINCT), and COUNT(DISTINCT) are supported.
#
# 			AVG(DISTINCT) and SUM(DISTINCT) takes a single argument.
#
# 			COUNT(DISTINCT) can have more than once column argument.
#
# 		) There must be no GROUP BY or DISTINCT clause in the query
#
# 		) The Loose Index Scan limitations described previously still apply.
#
# Assume that there is an index idx(c1,c2,c3) on table t1(c1,c2,c3,c4).
#
# The Loose Index Scan access method can be used for the following queries:
#
# 		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c1), SUM(DISTINCT c1) FROM t1;
#
# 		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c1, c2), COUNT(DISTINCT c2, c1) FROM t1;
#
# TIGHT INDEX SCAN
#
# A Tight Index Scan may be either a full index scan or a range index scan, depending on the query conditions.
#
# When the conditions for a Loose Index Scan are not met, it still may be possible to avoid creation of temporary
# tables for GROUP BY queries.
#
# If there are range conditions in teh WHERE Clause, this method reads only the keys that satisfy these conditions.
#
# Otherwise, it performs an index scan.
#
# Because this method reads all keys in each range defined by the WHERE clause, or scans the whole index if there
# are no range conditions, it is called a Tight Index Scan.
#
# With a tight index scan, the grouping operation is performed only after all keys that satisfy the range conditions
# have been found.
#
# For this method to work, it is sufficient that there be a constant equality condition for all columns in a query referring
# to parts of the key coming before or in between parts of the GROUP BY key.
#
# The constants from the equality conditions fill in any "gaps" in the search keys so that it is possible to form complete
# prefixes of the index.
#
# These index prefixes then can be used for index lookups.
#
# If the GROUP BY result requires sorting, and it is possible to form search keys that are prefixes of the index,
# MySQL also avoids extra sorting operations because searching with prefixes in an ordered index already retrieves
# all the keys in order.
#
# Assume that htere is an index idx(c1,c2,c3) on table t1(c1,c2,c3,c4).
#
# The following queries do not work with the Loose Index Scan access method described 
# previously, but still work with the Tight Index Scan access method.
#
# 		) There is a gap in the GROUP BY, but it is covered by the condition c2 = 'a'
#
# 			SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 'a' GROUP BY c1, c3;
#
# 		) The GROUP BY does not begin with the first part of the key, but there is a condition that provides 
# 			a constant for that part:
#
# 			SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 'a' GROUP BY c2, c3;
#
# DISTINCT OPTIMIZATION
#
# DISTINCT combined with ORDER BY needs a temporary table in many cases.
#
# Because DISTINCT may use GROUP BY, learn how MySQL works with columns in ORDER BY or HAVING clauses
# that are not part of the selected columns.
#
# See later, in MySQL handling of GROUP BY.
#
# In most cases, a DISTINCT clause can be considered as a special case of GROUP BY.
# For example, the following two queries are equivalent:
#
# 		SELECT DISTINCT c1, c2, c3 FROM t1
# 		WHERE c1 > const;
#
# 		SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM t1
# 		WHERE c1 > const GROUP BY c1, c2, c3;
#
# Due to this equivalence, the optimizations applicable to GROUP BY queries can also be applied to queries with a DISTINCT
# clause.
#
# Thus, for more details on the optimization possibilities for DISTINCT queries, see group by optimization.
#
# When combining LIMIT row_count with DISTINCT, MySQL stops as soon as it finds row_count unique rows.
#
# If you do not use columns from all tables named in a query, MySQL stops scanning any unused tables as soon
# as it finds the first match.
#
# In the following case, assuming that t1 is used before t2 (which you can check with EXPLAIN), MySQL stops reading
# from t2 (for any particular row in t1) when it finds the first row in t2:
#
# 		SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a=t2.a;
#
# LIMIT QUERY OPTIMIZATION
#
# If you need only a specified number of rows from a result set, use a LIMIT clause in the query, rather than fetching
# the whole result set and throwing away the extra data.
#
# MySQL sometimes optimizes a query that has a LIMIT row_count clause and no HAVING clause:
#
# 		) If you select only a few rows with LIMIT, MySQL uses indexes in some cases when normally it would prefer to do a full table scan.
#
# 		) If you combine LIMIT row_count with ORDER BY, MySQL stops sorting as soon as it has found the first row_count rows of the sorted result,
# 			rather than sorting the entire result.
#
# 			If ordering is done by using an index, this is very fast.
#
# 			If a filesort must be done, all rows that match the query without the LIMIT clause are selected,
# 			and most or all of them are sorted, before the first row_count are found.
#
# 			After the intial rows have been found, MySQL does not sort any remainder of the result set.
#
# 			One manifestation of this behavior is that an ORDER BY query with and without LIMIT may return rows in different order,
# 			as described later in this section.
#
# 		) If you combine LIMIT row_count with DISTINCT, MySQL stops as soon as it finds row_count unique rows.
#
# 		) In some cases, a GROUP BY can be resolved by reading the index in order (or doing a sort on the index), then calculating
# 			summaries until the index value changes.
#
# 			In this case, LIMIT row_count does not calculate any unnecessary GROUP BY values.
#
# 		) As soon as MySQL has sent the required number of rows to the client, it aborts the query unless you are using SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS.
#
# 			In that case, the number of rows can be retrieved with SELECT FOUND_ROWS(). More later, on INFORMATION FUNCTIONS.
#
# 		) LIMIT 0 quickly returns an empty set.
#
# 			This can be useful for checking the validity of a query.
#
# 			It can also be employed to obtain the types of the result columns within applications that use a MYSQL API that makes
# 			result set metadata available.
#
# 			With the mysql client program, you can use the --column-type-info option to display result column types.
#
# 		) If the server uses temporary tables to resolve a query, it uses the LIMIT row_count clause to calculate how much space is required.
#
# 		) If an index is not used for ORDER BY but a LIMIT clause is also present, the optimizer may be able to avoid using a merge file
# 			and sort the rows in memory using an in-memory filesort operation
#
# If multiple rows have identical values in teh ORDER BY columns, the server is free to return those rows in any order,
# and may do so differently depending on the overall execution plan.
#
# In other words, the sort order of those rows is nondeterministic with respect to the nonordered columns.
#
# One factor that affects the execution plan is LIMIT, so an ORDER BY query with and without LIMIT may return rows
# in different orders.
#
# Consider this query,, which is sorted by the category column but nondeterministic with respect to the id and rating columns:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category;
# 		+----+-------------+--------------+
# 		| id | category 	 | rating 		 |
# 		+----+-------------+--------------+
# 		| 1  | 			1 	 | 		4.5 	 |
# 		| 5  | 			1 	 | 		3.2 	 |
# 		| 3  | 			2 	 | 		3.7 	 |
# 		| 4  | 			2 	 | 		3.5 	 |
# 		| 6  | 			2 	 | 		3.5 	 |
# 		| 2  | 			3   | 		5.0 	 |
# 		| 7  | 			3 	 | 		2.7 	 |
# 		+----+-------------+--------------+
#
# Including LIMIT may affect order of rows within each category value.
#
# For example, this is a valid query result:
#
# SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category LIMIT 5;
# +----+----------+--------+
# | id | category | rating |
# +----+----------+--------+
# | 1  | 		1  | 	4.5   |
# | 5  | 		1 	|  3.2 	|
# | 4  | 		2  |  3.5 	|
# | 3  | 		2  |  3.7   |
# | 6  |  		2  |  3.5 	|
# +----+----------+--------+
#
# In each case, the rows sorted by the ORDER BY column, which is all that is required by the SQL standard.
#
# If it is important to ensure that hte same row order with and without LIMIT, include additional columns in the ORDER BY clause to make the
# order deterministic.
#
# For example, if id values are unique, you can make rows for a given category value appear in id order by sorting like this:
#
# SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category, id;
# +----+---------------+--------+
# | id | category 	  | rating |
# +----+---------------+--------+
# | 1  | 			1 	  |  4.5   |
# | 5  | 			1 	  |  3.2   |
# | 3  | 			2 	  |  3.7   |
# | 4  | 			2    |  3.5   |
# | 6  | 			2    |  3.5   |
# | 2  | 			3 	  |  5.0   |
# | 7  | 			3    |  2.7   |
# +----+---------------+--------+
#
# SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category, id LIMIT 5;
#
# +---+----------------+--------+
# |id | category 		  | rating |
# +---+----------------+--------+
# | 1 | 			1 		  |  4.5   |
# | 5 | 			1 		  |  3.2   |
# | 3 | 			2 		  |  3.7   |
# | 4 | 			2 		  |  3.5   |
# | 6 | 			2 		  |  3.5   |

#
# FUNCTION CALL OPTIMIZATION
#
# MySQL functions are tagged internally as determnistic or nondeterministic.
#
# A function is nondeterministic if, given fixed values for its arguments - it can return different results for different invocations.
#
# Examples of nondeterministic functions: RAND, UUID()
#
# If a function is tagged nondeterministic, a reference to it in a WHERE clause is evaluated for every row (when selecting from one table)
# or by combination of rows (when selecting from a multiple-table join)
#
# MySQL also determines when to evaluate functions based on types of arguments, whether the arguments are table columns
# or constant values.
#
# A deterministic function that takes a table column as argument must be evaluated whenever that column changes value.
#
# Nondeterministic functions may affect query performance.
#
# FOr example, some optimizations may not be available, or more locking might be required.
#
# The following discussion uses RAND() but applies to other nondeterministic functions as well:
#
# SUppose that a table t has this definition:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, col_a VARCHAR(100));
#
# Consider these two queries:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = POW(1,2);
# 		SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = FLOOR(1 + RAN() * 49);
#
# Both queries appear to use a primary key lookup because of the equality comparisons against the primary key, but that is true only for the first one:
#
# 		) The first query always produces a maxium of one row because POW() with constant args is a constant value and is used for index lookup.
#
# 		) The second query contains an expression that uses the nondeterministic function RAND(), which is not constant in teh query but in fact has
# 			a new value for every row of table t.
#
# 			Consequently, the query reads every row of the table, evaluates the predicate for each row, and outputs all rows for which the primary key
# 			matches the random value.
#
# 			This might be 0, 1, or multiple rows - depending on the ID column values and the reuslt of RAND().
#
# The effects of nondeterminism are not limited to SELECT statements. 
# This UPDATE statement uses a nondeterministic function to select rows to be modified:
#
# 		UPDATE t SET col_a = some_expr WHERE id = FLOOR(1 + RAND() * 49);
#
# Presumably, the intent is to update at most a single row for which the primary key matches the expression.
#
# However, it might update  randomly many, due to afformentioned RNG.
#
# The behavior just described has implications for performance and replication:
#
# 		) Because a nondeterministic function does not produce a constant value, the optimizer cannot use strategies
# 			that might otherwise be applicable, such as index lookups.
#
# 			THe result may be a table scan.
#
# 		) InnoDB might escalate to a range-key lock rather than taking a single row lock for one matching row.
#
# 		) Updates that do not execute determinsitically are unsafe for replication.
#
# The difficulties stem form the fact that hte RAND() fuinction is evaluated once for every row in the table.
#
# To avoid multiple function evaluations, use one of these techniques:
#
# 		) Move the expression containing the nondeterministic function to a separate statement, saving the value in a variable.
#
# 			In the original statement, replace the expression with a reference to the variable, which the optimizer can treat
# 			as a constant value:
#
# 			SET @keyval = FLOOR(1 + RAND() * 49);
# 			UPDATE t SET col_a = some_expr WHERE id = @keyval;
#
# 		) Assign the random value to a variable in a derived table.
#
# 			This technique causes the variable to be assigned a value, once, prior to its use in the comparison in the WHERE clause:
#
# 			UPDATE /*+ NO_MERGE(dt) */ t, (SELECT FLOOR(1 + RAND() * 49) AS r) AS dt
# 			SET col_a = some_expr WHERE id = dt.r;
#
# AS mentioned previously, a nondeterministic expression in the WHERE clause might prevent oiptimization and result in a table scan.
#
# However, it may be possible to partially optimize the WHERE clause if other expressions are deterministic.
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t WHERE partial_key=5 AND some_column=RAND();
#
# If the optimizer cna use partial_key to reduce the set of rows selected, RAND() is executed fewer times,
# which diminishes the effect of nondeterminism on optimization.
#
# WINDOW FUNCTION OPTIMIZATION
#
# Window functions affect the strategies the optimizer considers:
#
# 		) Derived table merging for a subquery is disabled if the subquery has window functions. The subquery is always materialized.
#
# 		) Semi-joins are not applicable to Window function optimization because semi-joins apply to subqueries in WHERE and JOIN_---_ON,
# 			which cannot contain window functions.
#
# 		) The optimizer processes multiple windows that have the same ordering requirements in sequence, so sorting can be skipped for windows following the first one.
#
# 		) The optimizer makes no attempt to merge windows that could be evaluated in a single step;
#
# 			For example, when multiple OVER clauses contain identical WINDOW definitions.
#
# 			THe workaround is to define the window in a WINDOW clause and refer to the window name in the OVER clauses.
#
# An aggregate function not used as a window function is aggregated in the outermost possible query.
#
# For example, in thsi query, MySQL sees that COUNT(t1.b) is something that cannot exist in the outer query,
# because of its placement in teh WHERE clause:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a = (SELECT COUNT(t1.b) FROM t2);
#
# Conseuqently, MySQL aggregates inside the subquery, treating t1.b as a constant and returning the count of rows of t2.
#
# Replacing WHERE with HAVING results in an error:
#
# SELECT * FROM t1 HAVING t1.a = (SELECT COUNT(t1.b) FROM t2);
# ERROR 1140 (42000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1
# of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'test.t1.a';
#
# This is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
#
# The error occurs because COUNT(t1.b) can exist in teh HAVING, and so make the outer query aggregated.
#
# WIndow functions (including aggregated functions used as window functions), do not have the preceding complexity.
#
# They always aggregate in the subquery where they are written, never in the outer query.
#
# Window functions evaluation may be affected by the value of the windowing_use_high_precision system variable,
# which determines whether to compute window operations without loss of precision.
#
# By default, window_use_high_precision is enabled.
#
# FOr some moving frame aggregates, teh inverse aggregate function can be applied to remove values from the aggregate.
# This can improve performance but possibly with a loss of precision.
#
# FOr example, adding a very small floating-point vlaue to a very large value causes the small value to be hidden by the large value.
#
# WHen inverting the large value later, the effect of the small value is lost.
#
# Loss of precision due to inverse aggregation is a factor only for operations on floating point (approx) data types.
#
# For other types, inverse aggregation is safe; this includes DECIMAL, which permits a fractional part but is an exact-value type.
#
# For faster execution, MySQL always uses inverse aggregation when it is safe:
#
# 		) For floating-point values, inverse aggregation is not always safe and might result in loss of precision.
#
# 			The default is to avoid inverse aggregation, which is slower, but preserves precision.
#
# 			If it is permissible to sacrifice safety for speed, windowing_use_high_precision can be disabled
# 			to permit inverse aggregation.
#
# 		) FOr nonfloating-point data types, inverse aggregation is always safe and is used regardless of the windowing_use_high_precision value.
#
# 		) windowing_use_high_precision has no effect on MIN(), and MAX(), which do not use inverse aggregation in any case.
#
# For evaluation of the variance functions STDDEV_POP(), STDDEV_SAMP(), VAR_POP(), VAR_SAMP(), and their synonyms, evaluation can occur
# in optimized mode or default mode.
#
# Optimized mode may produce slightly different results in teh last sig. digits
#
# If such differences are permissible, windowing_use_high_precision can be disabled to permit optimized mode.
#
# For EXPLAIN, windowing executing plan information is too extensive to display in traditional output format.
#
# To see windowing information, use EXPLAIN_FORMAT=JSON and look for the Windowing element.
#
# ROW CONSTRUCTOR EXPRESSION OPTIMIZATION
#
# Row constructors permit simultaneous comparisons of multiple values.
#
# For example, these two statements are semantically equivalent:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (column1,column2) = (1,1);
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = 1 AND column2 = 1;
#
# In addition, the optimizer handles both expressions the same way.
#
# THe optimizer is less likely to use avaiable indexes if the row constructor columns
# do not cover the prefix of an index.
#
# Consider the following table, which has the primary key on (c1, c2, c3):
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 			c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT, c4 CHAR(100),
# 			PRIMARY KEY(c1,c2,c3)
# 		);
#
# In this query, the WHERE clause uses all columns in teh index.
#
# However, the row constructor itself does not cover an index prefix, with the result that the
# optimizer uses only c1(key_len=4, the size of c1):
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1
# 		WHERE c1=1 AND (c2,c3) > (1,1)\G
# 		***************** 1. row ************************
# 		
# 							id: 1
# 				select_type: SIMPLE
# 						table: t1
# 				partitions:  NULL
# 						type:  ref
# 			possible_keys:  PRIMARY
# 						key :  PRIMARY
# 					key_len:  4
# 						ref:  const
# 					 rows :  3
# 				Filtered :  100.00
# 				Extra     : Using where
#
# IN such cases,, rewriting the row constructor expression using an equivalent nonconstructor expression may
# result in a more complex index use.
#
# For the given query, the row constructor and equivalent nonconstructor expressions are:
#
# 	(c2, c3) > (1,1)
# 	c2 > 1 OR ((c2 = 1) AND (c3 > 1))
#
# Rewriting the query to use the nonconstructor expression results in the optimizer using all three
# columns in the index (key_len=12):
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1
# 		WHERE c1 = 1 AND (c2 > 2 OR ((c2 = 1) AND (c3 > 1)))\G
# 		***************** 1. row 	************************
# 							id: 1
# 				select_type: SIMPLE
# 						table: t1
# 				partitions:  NULL
# 						type:  range
# 			possible_keys:  PRIMARY
# 						key:   PRIMARY
# 					key_len:  12
# 						  ref: NULL
# 						rows:  3
# 					filtered: 100.00
# 					Extra   : Using where
#
# Thus, for better results, avoid mixing row constructors with AND/OR expressions.
#
# Use one or the other.
#
# Under certain conditions, the optimizer can apply the range across method to IN() expressions that have
# row constructor arguments.
#
# See more under range optimization of Row constructor Expressions
#
# AVOIDING FULL TABLE SCANS
#
# THe output from EXPLAIN shows ALL in the type column when MySQL uses a full table scan to resolve a query.
#
# THis usually happens under the following conditions:
#
# 		) The table is so small that it is faster to perform a table scan than to bother with a key lookup.
#
# 			This is common for tables with < 10 rows and a short row length.
#
# 		) There are no usable restrictions in teh ON or WHERE clause for indexed columns.
#
# 		) You are comparing indexed columns with constant values and MySQL has calculated (based on the index tree), 
# 			that the constants cover too large a part of the table and that a table scan would be faster.
#
# 		) You are using a keyy with low cardinality (many rows match the key value) through another column.
#
# 			In this case, MySQL assumes taht by using the key it probably will do many key lookups and that
# 			a table scan would be faster.
#
# For small tables, a table scan often is appropriate and the performance impact is negligble.
#
# For large tables, try the following techniques to avoid having the optimizer incorrectly choose a table scan:
#
# 		) Use ANALYZE TABLE tbl_name to update the key distribs for the scanned table. More on this later.
#
# 		) Use FORCE INDEX for the scanned table to tell MySQL that table scans are very expensive compared to using the given index:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM t1, t2 FORCE INDEX (index_for_column)
# 				WHERE t1.col_name=t2.col_name;
#
# 			See more on Index hints later.
#
# 		) Start mysqld with the --max-seeks-for-key=1000 option or use SET max_seeks_for_key=1000 to tell
# 			the opptimizer to assume that no key scan causes more than 1k key seeks.
#
# 			See server vars since earlier for more info about this.
#
# OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES, DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES, AND COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS
#
# The MySQL query optimizer has different strategies available to evaluate subqueries.
#
# For IN( Or =ANY) subqueries, the optimizer has these choices:
#
# 		) Semi-join
#
# 		) Materialization
#
# 		) EXISTS strategy
#
# For NOT IN ( or <>ALL) subqueries, the optimizer has these choices:
#
# 		) Materialization
#
# 		) EXISTS strategy
#
# For derived tables, the optimizer has these choices:
#
# 		) Merge the derived table into the outer query block
#
# 		) Materialize the derived table to an internal temporary table
#
# FOr view references and common tabl exp., the optimizer has the same choices as for derived tables.
#
# The following discussion provides more info about the preceding optimization strategies.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		A limitation on UPDATE and DELETE statements that uses a subquery to modify a single table
# 		is that the optimizer does not use semi-join or materialization subquery optimizations.
#
# 		As a workaround, try rewriting them as multiple-table UPDATE and DELETE statements that use a join
# 		rather than a subquery.
#
# OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES, DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES AND COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS WITH SEMI-JOIN TRANSFORMATIONS
#
# The optimizer uses semi-join strategies to improve subquery execution, as described here.
#
# For an inner join between two tables, teh join returns a row from one table as many times as there are 
# matches in the other table.
#
# But for some questions, the only information that matters is whether there is a match, not hte number
# of matches.
#
# Suppose that htere are tables named class and roster, that list classes in a course curriculum and class rosters
# (students enrolled in each class), respectively.
#
# TO list the classes that actually have students enrolled, you could use this join:
#
# 	SELECT class.class_num, class.class_name
# 	FROM class INNER JOIN roster
# 	WHERE class.class_num = roster.class_num;
#
# However, the result lists each class once for each enrolled student.
#
# This is unessecary duplication.
#
# Assuming that class_num is a primary key in the class table, duplication suppression is possible
# by using SELECT_DISTINCT, but it is inefficient to generate all matching rows first to eliminate duplicates later.
#
# THe same duplicate-free result can be obtained by using a subquery:
#
# 		SELECT class_num, class_name
# 		FROM class
# 		WHERE class_num IN (SELECT class_num FROM roster);
#
# HEre, the optimizer can recognize that the IN Clause requires the subquery to return only one instance of each
# class number from the roster table.
#
# In this case, teh query can use a semi-join, that is, an operation that returns only one instnace
# of each row in class that is matched by rows in roster.
#
# Outer join and inner join syntax is permitted in the outer query specification, and table references
# may be base tables, derived tables, view references, or common table expressions.
#
# In MySQL , a subquery must satisfy these criteria to be handled as a semi-join:
#
# 		) It must be an IN (or =ANY) subquery that appears at the top level of the WHERE or ON clause,
# 			possibly as a term in an AND expression.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 				SELECT ---
# 				FROM ot1, ---
# 				WHERE (oe1, ---) IN (SELECT ie1, --- FROM it1, --- WHERE ---);
#
# 			Here, ot_i and it_i represent tables in the outer and inner parts of the uqeyr,
# 			and oe_i and ie_i represent expressions that refer to columns in the outer and inner
# 			tables.
#
# 		) It must be a single SELECT without UNION constructs.
#
# 		) It must not contain a GROUP BY or HAVING clause.
#
# 		) It must not be implicitly grouped (it must contain no aggregate functions)
#
# 		) It must not have ORDER BY with LIMIT
#
# 		) The statement must not use the STRAIGHT_JOIN join type in the outer query
#
# 		) The STRAIGHT_JOIN modifier must noe be present
#
# 		) THe number of outer and inner tables together must be less than the max number of tables permitted in a join
#
# The subquery may be correlated or uncorrelated.
#
# DISTINCT is permitted, as is LIMIT unless ORDER BY is also used.
#
# iF a subquery meets the preceding criteria, MysQL converts it to a semi-join and makes
# a cost-based choice from these strategies:
#
# 		) Convert the subquery to a join, or use table pullout and run the query as an inner join between
# 			subquery tables and outer tables.
#
# 			Table pullout pulls a table out from the subquery to the outer query
#
# 		) Duplicate Weedout: Run the semi-join as if it was a join and remove duplicate records using a temp table
#
# 		) FirsTMatch: When scanning the inner tables for row combinations, and there are multiple instances of a given value group,
# 							choose one rather than returning them all.
#
# 							This "shortcuts" scanning and eliminates production of unessecary rows
#
# 		) LooseScan: Scan a subquery table using an index that enables a single value to be chosen from each subquery's value group
#
# 		) Materialize the subquery into an indexed temporary table that is used to perform a join, where the index is used
# 			to remove duplicates.
#
# 			The index might also be used later for lookups when joining the temporary table with the outer tables;
# 			If not, teh table is scanned.
#
# 			For more information about materialization, see later.
#
# Each of these strategies can be enabled or disabled using the following optimizer_switch system variable flags:
#
# 	) The semijoin flag controls whether semi-joins are used
#
# 	) If semijoin is enabled, teh firstmatch, loosescan, duplicateweedout and materialization flags enable finer control
# 			over hte permitted semi-join strats.
#
# 	) If the duplicateweedout semi-join strategy is disabled, it is not used unless all other applicable stats are also disabled
#
# 	) If duplicatweedout is disabled, on ocassion the optimizer may generate a query plan that is far from optimal.
#
# 		THis occurs due to heuristics pruning during greedy search, which can be avoided by setting optimizer_prune_level=0
#
# THese flags are enabled by default. More later.
#
# The optimizer minimizes differences in handling of views and derived tables.
#
# This affects queries that use the STRAIGHT_JOIN modifier and a view with an IN subquery that
# can be converted to a semi-join.
#
# The following query illustrates this because the change in processing causes a change in trasnformation,
# and thus a different execution strat:
#
# 		CREATE VIEW v AS
# 		SELECT
# 		FROM t1
# 		WHERE a IN (SELECT b
# 						FROM t2);
#
# 		SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN *
# 		FROM t3 JOIN v ON t3.x = v.a;
#
# The optimizer first looks at hte view and converts the IN subquery to a semi-join, then checks
# whether it is possible to merge the view into the outer query.
#
# BEcause the STRAIGHT_JOIN modifier in the outer query prevents semi-join, the optimizer refuses the merge,
# causing derived table evaluation using a materialzied table.
#
# EXPLAIN output indicates the use of a semi-join strat as follows:
#
# 		) For extended EXPLAIN output, the text displayed by a following SHOW_WARNING shows the rewritten query,
# 			which displays the semi-join structure.
#
# 			From this, you can get an idea about which tables were pulled out of the semi-join.
#
# 			If a subquery was converted to a semi-join, you will see that hte predicate is gone
# 			and its tables and WHERE clause were merged into teh outer query join list
# 			and WHERE Clause.
#
# 		) Temporary table use for Duplicate Weedout is indicated by Start Temporary and End Temporary in the Extra column.
#
# 			tables hat were not pulled out and are in the range of EXPLAIN output rows covered by Start temporary
# 			and End temporary have their rowid in the temp table.
#
# 		) FirstMatch(tbl_name) in the Extra column indicates join shortcutting
#
# 		) LooseScan(m--m) in the extra column indicates use of the LooseScan strat. m and n are key part numbers.
#
# 		) Temp table use for materialization is indicated by rows with a select_type value of MATERIALIZED
# 			and rows with a table value of <subqueryN>
#
# OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES WITH MATERIALIZATION
#
# The optimizer uses materialization to enable more efficient subquery processing.
#
# Materialization speeds up query execution by generating a subquery result as a temp table,
# normally in memory.
#
# The first time MySQl needs the subquery result, it materializes that result into a temp table.
# Any subsequent time the result is needed, MySQL refers again to the temp table.
#
# THe optimizer may index the table with a hash index to make lookups fast and inexpensive.
#
# The index is unique, which eliminates duplicates and makes the table smaller.
#
# SUbquery materialization uses a in-memory temp table when possible,
# falling back on disk storage if the table becomes too large.
#
# If materialization is not used, the optimizer sometimes rewrites a noncorrelated subquery as a correlated
# subqery.
#
# For example, the following IN subquery is noncorrelated (where_condition involves only columns from t2
# and not t1):
#
# 	SELECT * FROM t1
# 	WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT t2.b FROM t2 WHERE where_condition);
#
# The optimizer might rewrite this as an EXISTS correlated subquery:
#
# SELECT * FROM t1
# WHERE EXISTS (SELECT t2.b FROM t2 WHERE where_condition AND t1.a=t2.b);
#
# Subquery materialization using a temporary table avoids such rewrites and makes it possible
# to execute the subquery only once rather than once per row of the outer query.
#
# For subquery materialization to be used in MySQL, the optimizer_switch system variable materialization
# flag must be enabled.
#
# (see more on this under Switchable Optimizations)
#
# With the materialization flag enabled, materialization applies to subquery predicates that appear anywhere
# (in the select list, WHERE ON, GROUP BY, HAVING or ORDER BY), for predicates that fall into any of these use cases:
#
# 		) The predicate has this form, when no outer expression oe_i or inner expression ie_i is nullable.
# 			N is 1 or larger.
#
# 			(oe_1, oe_2, ---, oe_N) [NOT] IN (SELECT ie_1, i_2, ---, ie_N ---)
#
# 		) The predicate has this form, when there is a single outer expression oe and inner expression ie.
# 			The expression can be nullable.
#
# 			oe [NOT] IN (SELECT ie ---)
#
# 		) The predicate is IN or NOT IN and a result of UNKNOWN (NULL) has the same meaning as a result of FALSE.
#
# The following examples illustrate how the requirement for equivalence of UNKNOWN and FALSE predicate evaluation
# affects whether subquery materialization can be used.
#
# Assume that where_condition involves columns only from t2 and not t1 so that the subquery is noncorrelated.
#
# This query is subject to materialization:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 		WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT t2.b FROM t2 WHERE where_condition);
#
# Here, it does not matter whether the IN predicate returns UNKNOWN or FALSE.
# Either way, the row from t1 is not included in the query result
#
# An example where subquery materialization is not used is the following query, where t2.b is a nullable column:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 		WHERE (t1.a, t1.b) NOT IN (SELECT t2.a, t2.b FROM t2 WHERE where_condition);
#
# The following restrictions apply to the use of subquery materialization:
#
# 		) The types of the inner and outer expressions must match. 
#
# 			For example, the optimizer might be able to use materialization if both expressions
# 			 are integer or both are decimal, but cannot if one expression is integer and the other is decimal.
#
# 		) The inner expression cannot be a BLOB
#
# use of EXPLAIN with a query provides some indication of whether the optimizer uses subquery materialization.
#
# Compared to query execution that does not use materialization, select_type may change from DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
# to SUBQUERY.
#
# This indicates that, for a subquery that would be executed once per outer row, materialization enables the
# subquery to be executed just once.
#
# In addition, for extended EXPLAIN output, the text displayed by a following SHOW_WARNINGS includes
# materialize and materialized-subquery.
#
# OPTIMIZING DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES, AND COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS
#
# The optimizer can handle derived table references using two strategies:
#
# 		) merge the derived table into the outer query block
#
# 		) Materialize the derived table to an internal temporary table
#
# The optimizer uses the same strategies to handle view references and common table expressions.
#
# Example 1:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) AS derived_t1;
#
# 			With merging, that query is executed similar to:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM t1;
#
# Example 2:
#
# 			SELECT *
# 				FROM t1 JOIN (SELECT t2.f1 FROM t2) AS derived_t2 ON t1.f2=derived_t2.f1
# 				WHERE t1.f1 > 0;
#
# 			With merging, that query is executed similar to:
#
# 			SELECT t1.*, t2.f1
# 				FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.f2=t2.f1
# 				WHERE t1.f1 > 0;
#
# With materialization, derived_t1 and derived_t2 are treated as a separate table within their respective queries.
#
# The optimizer handles derived tables and view references the same way: it avoids unnecessary materializaton whenever
# possible, which enables pushing down conditions from the outer query to derived tables and produces more efficient
# execution plans.
#
# (For mroe on this, see earlier)
#
# If merging would result in an outer query block that references more than 61 base tables, the optimizer chooses materialization
# instead.
#
# The optimizer propagates an ORDER BY clause in a derived table or view reference to the outer query block if these conditions
# are all true:
#
# 		) The outer query is not grouped or aggregated
#
# 		) The outer query does not specify DISTINCT, HAVING or ORDER By
#
# 		) The outer query has this derived table or view reference as the only source in the FROM clause.
#
# Otherwise, the optimizer ignores the ORDER BY clause.
#
# The following means are available to influence whether the optimizer attempts to merge derived tables
# and view references into the outer query block:
#
# 		) The MERGE and NO_MERGE optimizer hints can be used.
#
# 			They apply assuming that no other rule prevents merging. See more under optimizer hints.
#
# 		) Similarly, you can use the derived_merge flag of the optimizer_switch system variable.
# 			More under switchable optimizations.
#
# 			By default, the flag is enabled to permit merging.
#
# 			Disabling the flag prevents merging and avoids ER_UPDATE_TABLE_USED errors.
#
# 			The derived_merge flag also applies to views that contain no ALGORITHM clause.
#
# 			Thus, if an ER_UPDATE_TABLE_USED error occurs for a view reference that uses an 
# 			expression equivalent to the subquery, adding ALGORITHM=TEMPTABLE to the view 
# 			definition prevents merging and takes precedence over the derived_merge value.
#
# 		) It is possible to disable merging by using in the subquery any constructs that prevent merging,
# 			although these are not as explicit in their effect on materialization.
#
# 			Constructs that prevent merging are the same for derived tables, common table expressions,
# 			and view references:
#
# 				) Aggregate functions or window functions (SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT() and so forth)
#
# 				) DISTINCT
#
# 				) GROUP BY
#
# 				) HAVING
#
# 				) LIMIT
#
# 				) UNION or UNION_ALL
#
# 				) Subqueries in the select list
#
# 				) Assignments to user variables
#
# 				) References only to literal values (in this case, there is no underlying table)
#
# If the optimizer choosses the materialization strategy rather than merging for a derived table,
# it handles the query as follows:
#
# 		) The optimizer postpones derived table materialization until its contents are needed during query execution.
#
# 			This improves performance because delaying materialization may result in not having to do it at all.
#
# 			Consider a query that joins the result of a derived table to another table: 
#
# 				If the optimizer processes that other table first and finds that it returns no rows,
# 				the join need not be carried out further and the optimizer can completely skip materializing
# 				the derived table.
#
# 		) During query execution, the optimizer may add an index to a derived table to speed up row retrieval from it.
#
# Consider the following EXPLAIN statement, for which a subquery appears in the FROM clause of a SELECT query:
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) AS derived_t1;
#
# The optimizer avoids materializing the subquery by delaying it until the result is needed during SELECT
# execution.
#
# IN this case, the query is not executed (because it occurs in an EXPLAIN statement), so the result is never needed.
#
# Even for queries that are executed, delay of subquery materialization may enable the optimizer to avoid
# materialization entirely.
#
# When this happens, query execution is quicker by the time needed to perform materialization.
# Consider the following query, which joins the result of a subquery in the FROM clause to another table:
#
# 		SELECT *
# 			FROM t1 JOIN (SELECT t2.f1 FROM t2) AS derived_t2
# 					  ON t1.f2=derived_t2.f1
# 			WHERE t1.f1 > 0;
#
# If the optimization processes t1 first and the WHERE clause produces an empty result,
# the join must necessarily be empty and the subquery need not be materialized.
#
# For cases when a derived table requires materialization, the optimizer may add an index
# to the materialized table to speed up access to it.
#
# If such an index enables ref access to the table, it can greatly reduce amount of data 
# read during query execution.
#
# Consider the following query:
#
# 		SELECT *
# 			FROM t1 JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT f1 FROM t2) AS derived_t2
# 						ON t1.f1=derived_t2.f1;
#
# The optimizer constructs an index over column f1 from derived_t2 if doing so would enable use of
# ref access for the lowest cost execution plan.
#
# After adding the index, the optimizer can treat the materialized derived table the same as a regular
# table with an index, and it benefits similarly from the generated index.
#
# The overhead of index creation is negligble compared to the cost of query execution without the index.
#
# If ref access would result in higher cost than some other access method, the optimizer creates no index
# and loses nothing.
#
# For optimizer trace output, a merged derived table or view reference is not shown as a node.
#
# Only its underlying tables appear in the top query's plan.
#
# What is true for materialization of derived tables is also true for common table expressions (CTEs).
# In addition, the following considerations pertain specifically to CTEs.
#
# If a CTE is materialized by a query, it is materialized once for the query, even if the query references
# it several times.
#
# A recursive CTE is always materialized.
#
# If a CTE is materialized, the optimizer automatically adds relevant indexes if it estimates that indexing will
# speed up access by the top-level statement to the CTE.
#
# This is similar to automatic indexing of derived tables, except that if the CTE is referenced multiple times,
# the optimizer may create multiple indexes to speed up access by each reference in the most appropriate way.
#
# THe MERGE and NO_MERGE optimizer hints can be applied to CTEs. Each CTE reference in the top-level statement
# can have its own hint, permitting CTE references to be selectively merged or materialized.
#
# The following statement uses hints to indicate that cte1 should be merged and cte2 should be materialized:
#
# 		WITH
# 			cte1 AS (SELECT a, b FROM table1),
# 			cte2 AS (SELECT c, d FROM table2)
# 		SELECT /*+ MERGE(cte1) NO_MERGE(cte2) */ cte1.b ,cte2.d
# 		FROM cte1 JOIN cte2
# 		WHERE cte1.a = cte2.c;
#
# The ALGORITHM clause for CREATE_VIEW does not affect materialization for any WITH clause preceding the SELECT
# statement in the view definition.
#
# Consider this statement:
#
# 		CREATE ALGORITHM={TEMPTABLE|MERGE} VIEW v1 AS WITH --- SELECT ---
#
# The ALGORITHM value affects materialization only of the SELECT, not the WITH clause.
#
# For CTEs, the storage engine used for on-disk internal temp tables cannot be MyISAM.
#
# If internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine=MyISAM, an error occurs for any attempt to materialize a CTE
# using an on-disk temporary table.
#
# As mentioned previously, a CTE, if materialized, is materialized once, even if referneced multiple times.
#
# To indicate one-time materialization, optimizer trace output contains an occurence
# of creating_tmp_table plus one or more occurrences of reusing_tmp_table.
#
# CTEs are similar to derived tables, for which the materialized_from_subquery node follows the reference.
#
# This is true for a CTE that is referenced multiple times, so there is no duplication of materialized_from_subquery
# nodes (which would give the impression that the subquery is executed multiple times, and produce unnecessarily
# verbose output).
#
# Only one reference to the CTE has a complete materialized_from_subquery node with the description
# of its subquery plan.
#
# Other references have a reduced materialized_from_subquery node.
#
# THe same idea applies to EXPLAIN output in TRADITIONAL format; Subqueries for other references
# are not shown.
#
# OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES WITH THE EXISTS STRATEGY
#
# Certain optimizations are applicable to comparisons that use IN (or =ANY) operator to test subquery results.
#
# This section discusses these optimizations, particularly with regards to the challenges that NULL values present.
#
# THe last part of the discussion suggests how you can help the optimizer.
#
# Consider the following subquery comparison:
#
# 		outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM --- WHERE subquery_where)
#
# MySQL evaluates queries "from outside to inside".
#
# That is, it first otbains the values of the outer expression outer_expr, and then runs the subquery and captures the rows
# that it produces.
#
# A very useful optimization is to "inform" the subquery that the only rows of interest are those where
# the inner expression inner_expr is equal to outer_expr.
#
# THis is done by pushing down an appropriate equality into the subquery's WHERE clause to make it more restrictive.
# The converted comparison looks like this:
#
# 		EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM --- WHERE subquery_where AND outer_expr=inner_expr)
#
# After the conversion, MySQL can use the pushed-down equality to limit the number of rows it must examine
# to evaluate the subquery.
#
# More generally, a comparison of N values to a subquery that returns N-value rows is subject to
# the same conversion.
#
# If oe_i and ie_i represent corresponding outer and inner expression values, this subquery comparison:
#
# 		(oe_1, ---, oe_N) IN
# 			(SELECT ie_1, ---, ie_N FROM --- WHERE subquery_where)
#
# Becomes:
#
# 		EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM --- WHERE subquery_WHERE
# 										  AND oe_1 = ie_1
# 										  AND ---
# 										  AND oe_N = ie_N)
#
# FOr simplicity, the following discussion assumes a single pair of outer and inner expression values.
#
# The conversion just described has its limitations. It is valid only if we ignore possible NULL values.
# That is, the "Pushdown" strategy works as long as both of tehse conditions are true:
#
# 		) outer_expr and inner_expr CANNOT be NULL
#
# 		) You need not distinguish NULL from FALSE subquery results.
#
# 			If the subquery is a part of an OR or AND expression in the WHERE clause,
# 			MySQL assumes that you do not care.
#
# 			Another instance where the optimizer notices that NULL and FALSE subquery results need not be
# 			distinguished is this construct:
#
# 				--- WHERE outer_expr IN (subquery)
#
# 			IN this case, the WHERE clause rejects the row whether IN (subquery) returns NULL or FALSE
#
# When either or both of those conditions do not hold, optimization is more complex.
#
# Suppose that outer_expr is known to be a non-NULL value but the subquery does not produce a row such that
# outer_expr = inner_expr 
#
# Then outer_expr IN (SELECT ---) evaluates as follows:
#
# 		) NULL, if the SELECT produces any row where inner_expr is NULL
#
# 		) FALSE, if the SELECT produces only non-NULL values or produces nothing
#
# In this situation, the approach of looking for rows with outer_expr = inner_expr is no longer valid.
#
# It is necessary to look for such rows, but if none are found, also look for rows where
# inner_expr is NULL.
#
# Roughly speaking, the subquery can be converted to something like this:
#
# 		EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM --- WHERE subquery_where AND 
# 					(outer_expr=inner_expr OR inner_expr IS NULL))
#
# THe need to evaluate the extra IS_NULL condition is why MySQL has the ref_or_null access method:
#
# 		EXPLAIN
# 		SELECT outer_expr IN (SELECT t2.maybe_null_key
# 									 FROM t2, t3 WHERE ---)
# 		FROM t1;
#
# 		****************** 1. row *******************************
# 							id: 1
# 				select_type: PRIMARY
# 						table: t1
# 		---
# 		****************** 2. row *******************************
# 							id: 2
# 				select_type: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
#  					table: t2
# 						 type: ref_or_null
# 			 possible_keys: maybe_null_key
# 						  key: maybe_null_key
# 					key_len : 5
# 						  ref: func
# 						rows : 2
# 					Extra   : Using where; Using index
#
# 	 	---
#
# The unique_subquery and index_subquery subquery-specific access methods also have "or NULL" variants.
#
# The additional OR --- IS NULL condition makes query execution slightly more complicated
# (and some optimizations within the subquery become inapplicable), but generally this is tolerable.
#
# The situation is much worse when outer_expr can be NULL.
#
# According to the SQL interpretation of NULL as "unknown value", NULL IN (SELECT inner_expr ---)
# should evaluate to:
#
# 		) NULL, if the SELECT produces any rows
#
# 		) FALSE, if the SELECT produces no rows
#
# For proper evaluation, it is necessary to be able to check whether the SELECT has produced any rows
# at all, so outer_expr = inner_expr cannot be pushed down into the subquery.
#
# This is a problem because many real world subqueries become very slow unless the equality can be pushed down.
#
# Essentially, there must be different ways to execute the subquery depending on the value of outer_expr
#
# The optimizer chooses SQL compliance over speed, so it accounts for the possibility that outer_expr
# might be NULL.
#
# 		) If outer_expr is NULL, to evaluate the following expression, it is necessary to execute the
# 			SELECT to determine whether it produces any rows:
#
# 			NULL IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM --- WHERE subquery_where)
#
# 			It is necessary to execute the original SELECT here, without any pushed-down equalities
# 			of the kind mentioned previously.
#
# 		) On the other hand, when outer_expr is not NULL, it is absolutely essential that this comparison:
#
# 			outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM --- WHERE subquery_where)
#
# 			Be converted to this expression that uses a pushed-down condition:
#
# 			EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM --- WHERE subquery_where AND outer_expr=inner_expr)
#
# 			Without this conversion, subqueries will be slow.
#
# To solve the dilemma of whether or not to push down conditions ino the subquery, the conditions
# are wrapped within "trigger" functions.
#
# Thus, an expression of the following form:
#
# 		outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM --- WHERE subquery_where)
#
# Is converted into:
#
# 		EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM --- WHERE subquery_where
# 										  AND trigcond(outer_expr=inner_expr))
#
# More generally, if the subquery comparison is based on several pairs of outer and inner
# expressions, the conversion takes this comparison:
#
# 		(oe_1, ---, oe_N) IN (SELECT ie_1, ---, ie_N FROM --- WHERE subquery_where)
#
# And converts it to this expression:
#
# 		EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM --- WHERE subquery_where
# 										  AND trigcond(oe_1=ie_1)
# 										  AND ---
# 										  AND trigcond(oe_N=ie_N)
# 					)
#
# Each trigcond(X) is a special function that evaluates to the following values:
#
# 		) X when the "linked" outer expression oe_i is not NULL
#
# 		) TRUE when the "linked" outer expression oe_i is NULL
#
# 		NOTE:
# 			Trigger functions are NOT triggers of the kind that you create with CREATE_TRIGGER
#
# Equalities that are wrapped within trigcond() functions are not first class predicates for the query
# optimizer.
#
# Most optimizations cannot deal with predicates that may be turned on and off at query execution time,
# so they assume any trigcond(X) to be an unknown function and ignore it.
#
# Triggered equalities can be used by those optimizations:
#
# 		) Reference optimizations: trigcond(X=Y [OR Y IS NULL]) can be used to construct ref, eq_ref, or ref_or_null table accesses.
#
# 		) Index lookup-based subquery execution engines: trigcond(X=Y) can be used to construct unique_subquery or index_subquery accesses.
#
# 		) Table-condition generator: If the subquery is a join of several tables, the triggered condition is checked as soon as possible.
#
# When the optimizer uses a triggered condition to create some kind of index lookup-based access
# (as for the first two items of the preceding list), it must have a fallback strategy for the case
# when the condition is turned off.
#
# This fallback strategy is always the same: Do a full table scan.
#
# In EXPLAIN output, the fallback shows up as Full scan on NULL key in the Extra column:
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT t1.col1,
# 		t1.col1 IN (SELECT t2.key1 FROM t2 WHERE t2.col2=t1.col2) FROM t1\G
# 		********************* 1. row ***********************
#
# 							id: 1
# 				select_type: PRIMARY
# 						table: t1

# 		********************* 2. row ************************

# 							id: 2
# 				select_type: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
# 						table: t2
# 						 type: index_subquery
# 			 possible_keys: key1
# 						  key: key1
# 					key_len : 5
# 						  ref: func
# 						 rows: 2
# 					   Extra: Using where; Full scan on NULL key
#
# If you run EXPLAIN followed by SHOW_WARNINGS, you can see the triggered condition:
#
# ******************************** 1. row ******************************
# 			
# 						Level: Note
# 						 Code: 1003
# 					Message : select `test`.`t1`.`col1` AS `col1`,
# 								 <in_optimizer>(`test`.`t1`.`col1`,
# 								 <exists>(<index_lookup>(<cache>(`test`.`t1`.`col1`) in t2
# 								 on key1 checking NULL
# 								 where (`test`.`t2`.`col2` = `test`.`t1`.`col2`) having
# 								 trigcond(<is_not_null_test>(`test`.`t2`.`key1`))))) AS
# 								 `t1.col1 IN (select t2.key1 from t2 where t2.col2=t1.col2)`
# 								 from `test`.`t1`
#
# The use of triggered conditions has some performance implications.
#
# A NULL IN (SELECT ---) expression now may cause a full table scan (which is slow),
# when it previously did not.
#
# This is the price paid for correct results (the goal of the trigger-condition strategy is to
# improve compliance, not speed)
#
# For multiple-table subqueries, execution of NULL IN (SELECT ---) is particularly slow because
# the join optimizer does not optimize for the case where the outer expression is NULL.
#
# It assumes that subquery evaluations with NULL on the left side are very rare, even if
# there are statistics taht indicate otherwise.
#
# On the other hand, if the outer expression might be NULL but never actually is, there is no
# performance penalty.
#
# To help the query optimizer better execute your queries, use these suggestions:
#
# 		) Declare a column as NOT NULL if it really is.
#
# 			This also helps other aspects of the optimizer by simplifying condition testing for the column.
#
# 		) If you need not distinguish a NULL from FALSE subquery result, you can easily avoid
# 			the slow execution path.
#
# 			Replace a comparison that looks like this:
#
# 				outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ---)
#
# 			with this expression:
#
# 				(outer_expr IS NOT NULL) AND (outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ---))
#
# 			Then NULL IN (SELECT ---) is never evaluated because MySQL stops evaluating AND parts as soon
# 			as the expression result is clear.
#
# 			Another possible rewrite:
#
# 				EXISTS (SELECT inner_expr FROM ---
# 						  WHERE inner_expr=outer_expr)
#
# 			This would apply when you need not distinguish NULL from FALSE subquery results, in which case you may actually want EXISTS.
#
# The subquery_materialization_cost_based flag of the optimizer_switch system variable enables
# control over the choice between subquery materialization and IN-to-EXISTS subquery transformations.
#
# OPTIMIZING INFORMATION_SCHEMA QUERIES
#
# Applications that monitor databases may make frequent use of INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.
# To write queries for these tables most efficiently, use the following general guidelines:
#
# 		) Try to query only INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables that are views on data dictionary tables
#
# 		) Try to query only for static metadata. Selecting columns or using retrieval conditions for dynamic metadata
# 			along with static metadata adds overhead to process the dynamic metadata.
#
# 			NOTE: 
# 				Comparison behavior for database and table names in INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries might differ from
# 				what you expect. See later in USING COLLATION IN INFORMATION SCHEMA SEARCHES
#
# These INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are implemented as views on data dictionary tables, so queries on them
# retrieve information from the data dictionary:
#
# 		CHARACTER_SETS
# 		COLLATIONS
# 		COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY
# 		COLUMNS
# 		EVENTS
# 		FILES
# 		INNODB_COLUMNS
# 		INNODB_DATAFILES
#
# 		INNODB_FIELDS
# 		INNODB_FOREIGN
# 		INNODB_FOREIGN_COLS
# 		INNODB_INDEXES
#
# 		INNODB_TABLES

# 		STATISTICS
# 		TABLES
# 
# 		TABLE_CONSTRAINTS
# 		TRIGGERS
# 		VIEWS
# 		VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE
# 		VIEW_TABLE_USAGE
#
# Some types of values, even for a non-view INFORMATION_SCHEMA table, are
# retrieved by lookups from the data dictionary.
#
# This includes values such as database and table names, table types, and storage engines.
#
# Some INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables contain columns that provide table statitics:
#
# 		STATISTICS.CARDINALITY
# 		TABLES.AUTO_INCREMENT
# 		TABLES.AVG_ROW_LENGTH
# 		TABLES.CHECKSUM
# 
# 		TABLES.CHECK_TIME
# 		TABLES.CREATE_TIME
# 		TABLES.DATA_FREE
# 		TABLES.DATA_LENGTH
#
# 		TABLES.INDEX_LENGTH
# 		TABLES.MAX_DATA_LENGTH
# 		TABLES.TABLE_ROWS
# 		TABLES.UPDATE_TIME
#
# Those columns represent dynamic table metadata; that is, information that changes as table contents change.
#
# By default, MySQL retrieves cached values for those columns from the mysql.index_stats and mysql.table_stats
# dictionary tables when the columns are queried, which is more efficient than retrieving statistics directly
# from the storage engine.
#
# If cached statistics are not available or have expired, MySQL retrieves teh latest statistics
# from the storage engine and caches them in the mysql.index_stats and mysql.table_stats dictionary tables.
#
# Subsequent queries retrieve the cached statistics until the cached statistics expire.
#
# The information_schema_stats_expiry session variable defines the period of time before cached statistics expire.
# The default is 86400 (24 hours), but the time period can be extended to as much as one year.
#
# To update cached values at any time for a given table, use ANALYZE_TABLE
#
# Querying statitics columns does not store or update statistics in the mysql.index_stats and
# mysql.table_stats dictionary table under these circumstances:
#
# 		) When cached statistics have not expired
#

# OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE SCHEMA QUERIES
#
# Applicatons that monitor databases may make frequent use of Performance Schema tables.
# To write queries for these tables most efficiently, take advantage of their indexes.
#
# For example, include a WHERE clause that restricts retrieved rows based on comparison
# to specific values in an indexed column.
#
# Most Performance Schema tables have indexes. Tables that do not are those that normally contain
# few rows or are unlikely to be queried frequently.
#
# Performance Schema indexes give the optimizer access to execution plans otehr than full table scans.
#
# These indexes also improve performance for related objects, such as sys schema views that
# use those tables.
#
# To see whether a given Performance Schema table has indexes and what they are, use SHOW_INDEX or
# SHOW_CREATE_TABLE:

#
# The EXPLAIN output indicates that hte optimizer uses the accounts table ACCOUNT index that
# comprises the USER and HOST columns.
#
# Performance Schema indexes are virtual: They are a construct of the Performance Schema storage engine
# and use no memory or disk storage.
#
# The Performance Schema reports index information to the optimizer so that it can construct efficient 
# execution plans.
#
# The Performance Schema in turn uses optimizer information about what to look for (for example, a particular key value)
# , so that it can perform efficient lookups without building actual index structures.
#
# This implementation provides two important benefits:
#
# 		) It entirely avoids the maintenance cost normally incurred for tables that undergo frequent updates.
#
# 		) It reduces at an early stage of query execution the amount of data retrieved.
#
# 			For conditions on the indexed columns, the Performance Schema efficiently returns only
# 			table rows that satisfy the query conditions.
#
# 			Without an index, the Performance Schema would return all rows in the table, requiring that
# 			the optimizer later evaluate the conditions against each row to produce the final result.
#
# Performance Schema indexes are predefined and cannot be dropped, added or altered.
#
# Performance Schema indexes are similar to hash indexes. For example:
#
# 		) They are used only for equality comparisons that use the = or <=> operators.
#
# 		) They are unordered. If a query result must have specific row ordering characteristics, include an ORDER BY clause.
#
# For additional information about hash indexes, see later.
#
# OPTIMIZING DATA CHANGE STATEMENTS
#
# This section explains how to speed up data change statements: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.
#
# Traditional OLTP applications and modern web applications typically do many small data change operations,
# where concurrency is vital.
#
# Data analysis and reporting applications typically run data change operations that affect many rows
# at once, where the main consideration is the I/O to write large amounts of data and keep indexes up-to-date.
#
# For inserting and updating large volumes of data (known in teh industry as ETL, or "extract-transform-load"),
# sometimes you use other SQL statements or external commands, that mimic the effects of INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.
#
# OPTIMIZING INSERT STATEMENTS
#
# To optimize insert speed, combine many operations into a single large operation.
#
# Ideally, you make a single connection, send the data for many new rows at once, and
# delay all index updates and consistency checking until the very end.
#
# The time required for inserting a row is determined by the following factors, where the numbers indicate
# approximate proportions:
#
# 		) Connecting: (3)
#
# 		) Sending query to the server: (2)
#
# 		) Parsing query: (2)
#
# 		) Inserting row: (1 * size of row)
#
# 		) Inserting indexes: (1 * number of indexes)
#
# 		) Closing: (1)
#
# This does not take into consideration the initial overhead to open tables, which is done once for each
# concurrently running query.
#
# The size of the table slows down the insertion if indexes by log N, assuming B-tree indexes.
#
# You can use the following methods to speed up inserts:
#
# 		) If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the same time, use INSERT statements with multiple
# 			VALUES lists to insert several rows at a time.
#
# 			This is considerably faster (many times faster in some cases) than using separate single-row INSERT
# 			statements.
#
# 			If you are adding data to a nonempty table, you can tune the bulk_insert_buffer_size variable to make
# 			data insertion even faster. See earlier.
#
# 		) When loading a table from a text file, use LOAD_DATA_INFILE. This is usually 20x faster than using INSERT statements.
# 			More later on the LOAD DATA INFILE syntax.
#
# 		) Take advantage of the fact that columns have default values.
#
# 			Insert values explicitly only when the value to be inserted differs from the default.
# 			THis reduces the parsing that MySQL must do and improves the insert speed.
#
# 		) See more later for bulk inserts in relation to InnoDB and MyISAM tables.
#
# OPTIMIZING UPDATE STATEMENTS
#
# An update statement is optimized like a SELECT query with the additional overhead of a write.
#
# The speed of the write depends on teh amount of data being updated and the number of indexes
# that are updated. Indexes that are not changed do not get updated.
#
# Another way to get fast updates is to delay updates and then do many updates in a row later.
#
# Performing multiple updates togetehr is much quicker than doing one at a time if you lock the table.
#
# For a MyISAM table that uses dynamic row format, updating a row to a longer total length may split the
# row.
#
# If you do this often, it is very important to use OPTIMIZE_TABLE ocassionally. 
#
# See more on the syntax of OPTIMIZE TABLE later.
#
# OPTIMIZING DELETE STATEMENTS
#
# The time required to delete individual rows in a MyISAM table is exactly proportional 
# to the number of indexes.
#
# To delete rows more quickly, you can increase the size of the key cache by increasing the
# key_buffer_size system variable.
#
# To delete all rows from a MyISAM table, TRUNCATE TABLE tbl_name is faster than DELETE FROM tbl_name.
#
# Truncate operations are not transaction-safe; an error occurs when attempting one in the course
# of an active transaction or active table lock.
#
# See more later on TRUNCATE TABLE syntax.
#
# OPTIMIZING DATABASE PRIVILEGES
#
# The more complex your privilege setup, the more overhead applies to all SQL statements.
#
# SImplifying the privileges established by GRANT statements enables MysQL to reduce permission-checking
# overhead when clients execute statements.
#
# For example, if you do not grant any table-level or column-level privileges, the server need not
# ever check the contents of the tables_priv and columns_priv tables.
#
# Similarly, if you place no resource limits on any accounts, the server does not have to
# perform resource counting.
#
# If you have a very high statement-processing load, consider using a simplified grant structure
# to reduce permission-checking overhead.
#
# OTHER OPTIMIZATION TIPS
#
# THis section lists a number of misc tips for improving query processing speed:
#
# 		) If your application makes several DB requests to perform related updates, combining
# 			the statements into a stored routine can help performance.
#
# 			Similarly, if your application computes a single result based on several columns values
# 			or large volumes of data, combining the computation into a UDF (user-defined function)
# 			can help performance.
#
# 			The resulting fast DB operations are then available to be reused by other queries,
# 			applications and even code written in different languages.
#
# 			More on this, USING STORED ROUTINES (PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS) and ADDING NEW FUNCTIONALITY TO MYSQL later.
#
# 		) To fix any compression issues that occur with ARCHIVE tables, use OPTIMIZE_TABLE. More later in THE ARCHIVE STORAGE ENGINE
#
# 		) If possible, classify reports as "live" or "statistical", where data needed for statistical reports is created
# 			only from summary tables that are generated periodically from the live data.
#
# 		) If you have data that does not conform well to a rows-and-columns table structure, you can pack
# 			and store data into a BLOB column.
#
# 			In this case, you must provide code in your application to pack and unpack information,
# 			but this might save I/O operations to read and write the sets of related values
#
# 		) With Web servers, store images and other binary assets as files, with the path name stored
# 			in the database rather than the file itself.
#
# 			Most web servers are better at caching files than DB contents, so using files is
# 			generally faster. (Although you must handle backups and storage issues yourself
# 			in this case)
#
# 		) If you need really high speed, look at the low-level MySQL interfaces.
#
# 			For example, by accessing the MySQL InnoDB or MyISAM storage engine directly,
# 			you could get a substansial speed increase compared to using the SQL interface.
#
# 		) Replication can provide a performance benefit for some operations.
#
# 			You can distribute client retrievals among replication servers to
# 			split up the load.
#
# 			To avoid slowing down the master while making backups, you can make
# 			backups using a slave server. More later on REPLICATION.
#
# OPTIMIZATION AND INDEXES
#
# The best way to improve performance of SELECT operations is to create indexes
# on one or more of the columns that are tested in the query.
#
# The index entries act like pointers to the table rows, allowing the query to
# quickly determine which rows match a condition in the WHERE clause, and retrieve
# the other column values for those rows.
#
# All MySQL data types can be indexed.
#
# although it can be tempting to create an index for every possible column used
# in a query, unecessary indexes waste space and time for MySQL to determine which
# indexes to use.
#
# Indexes also add to the cost of inserts, updates and deletes, because each index
# must be updated.
#
# You must find the right balance to achieve fast queries using the optimal set of
# indexes.
#
# HOW MYSQL USES INDEXES
#
# Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly.
#
# Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through
# the entire table to find the relevant rows.
#
# The larger the table, the more this costs.
#
# If the table has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly
# determine the position to seek to in the middle of the data file
# without having to look at all the data.
#
# This is much faster than reading every row sequentially.
#
# Most MySQL indexes (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE INDEX and FULLTEXT) are stored in B-trees.
# (More on thoose later)
#
# Exceptions: Indexes on spatial data types use R-trees; MEMORY tables also support
# hash indexes; InnoDB uses inverted lists for FULLTEXT indexes.
#
# In general, indexes are used as described in teh following discussion.
#
# Characteristics specific to hash indexes (as used in MEMORY tables) are described
# in a later section, COMPARISON OF B-TREE AND HASH INDEXES
#
# MySQL uses indexes for these operations:
#
# 		) To find the rows matching a WHERE clause quickly.
#
# 		) TO eliminate rows from consideration. If there is a choice between
# 			multiple indexes, MySQL normally uses the index that finds the smallest number of rows.
# 			(The most slective index)
#
# 		) If the table has multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the index can be used by
# 			the optimizer to look up rows.
#
# 			For example, if you have a three-column index on (col1, col2, col3), you have indexed 
# 			search capabilities on (col1), (col1, col2), and (col1, col2, col3)
#
# 			For more info on this, it is covered later in MULTIPLE COLUMN INDEXES
#
# 		) TO retrieve rows from other tables when performing joins, MySQL can use indexes
# 			on columns more effectively if they are declared as the same type and size.
#
# 			In this context, VARCHAR and CHAR are considered the same if they are declared
# 			as the same size.
#
# 			For example, VARCHAR(10) and CHAR(10) are the same size, but VARCHAR(10)
# 			and CHAR(15) are not.
#
# 			For comparisons between nonbinary string columns, both columns should use the same
# 			character set.
#
# 			For example, comparing a utf8 column with a latin1 column precludes use of an index.
#
# 			Comparison of dissimilar columns (comparing a string column to a temporal or numeric column,
# 			for example) - may prevent use of indexes if values cannot be compared directly
# 			without conversion.
#
# 			For a given value such as 1 in the numeric column, it might compare equal to any number
# 			of values in the string column such as '1', '1', '00001', or '01.e1'
#
# 			THis rules out use of any indexes for the string column.
#
# 		) To find the MIN() or MAX() value for a specified indexed column key_col.
# 			This is optimized by a preprocessor that checks whether you are using WHERE
# 			key_part_N = constant on all key parts that occur before key_col in the index.
#
# 			In this case, MysQL does a single key lookup for each MIN() or MAX() expression
# 			and replaces it with a constant.
#
# 			If all expressions are replaced with constants, the query returns at once.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 			SELECT MIN(key_part2), MAX(key_part2)
# 				FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=10;
#
# 		) To sort or group a table if the sorting or grouping is done on a leftmost prefix
# 			of a usable index (for example, ORDER BY key_part1, key_part2)
#
# 			If all key parts are followed by DESC, the key is read in reverse order.
#
# 			(Or, if the index is a descending index, the key is read in forward order)
#
# 			see earlier optimizations and more later in DESCENDING INDEXES
#
# 		) In some cases, a query can be optimized to retrieve values without consulting the 
# 			data rows. 
#
# 			(An index that provides all the necessary results for a query is called a
# 			covering index).
#
# 			If a query uses from a table only columns that are included in some index,
# 			the selected values can be retrieved from the index tree for greater speed:
#
# 				SELECT key_part3 FROM tbl_name
# 					WHERE key_part1=1;
#
# Indexes are less important for queries on small tables, or big tables where report queries process most
# or all of the rows.
#
# When a query needs to access most of the rows, reading sequentially is faster than working through an index.
#
# Sequential reads minimize disk seeks, even if not all the rows are needed for the query.
#
# SEe more in AVOIDING FULL TABLE SCANS
#
# PRIMARY KEY OPTIMIZATION
#
# The primary key for a table represents the column or set of columns that you use
# in your most vital queries.
#
# It has an associated index, for fast query performance.
#
# Query performance benefits from the NOT NULL optimization, because it cannot include any
# NULL values.
#
# With the InnoDB storage engine, the table data is physically organized to do ultra-fast
# lookups and sorts based on the primary key column or columns.
#
# If your table is big n important, but does not have an obvious column or set of columns
# to use as a primary key, you might create a separate column with auto-increment values to
# use as the primary key.
#
# These unique IDs can serve as pointers to corresponding rows in other tables when you
# join tables using foreign keys.
#
# SPATIAL INDEX OPTIMIZATION
#
# MySQL permits creation of SPATIAL indexes on NOT NULL geometry-valued columns (more later in CREATING SPATIAL INDEXES).
# 
# The optimizer checks the SRID attribute for indexed columns to determine which spatial reference system (SRS)
# to use for comparisons, and uses calculations appropriate to the SRS.
#
# (< 8.0, the optimizer performs comparisons of SPATIAL index values using Cartesian calculations; the result of such
# 	operations are undefined if the column contains values with non-Cartesian SRIDs)
#
# For comparisons to work properly, each column in a SPATIAL index must be SRID-restricted.
#
# That is, the column definition must include an explicit SRID attribute, and all column
# values must have the same SRID.
#
# The optimizer considers SPATIAL indexes only for SRID-restricted columns:
#
# 		) Indexes on columns restricted to a Cartesian SRID enable Cartesian bounding box computations.
#
# 		) Indexes on columns restricted to a geographic SRID enable geographic bounding box computations.
#
# The optimizer ignores SPATIAL indexes on columns that have no SRID attribute (and thus are not SRID-restricted).
# MySQL still maintains such indexes, as follows:
#
# 		) They are updated for table modifications (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and so forth).
#
# 			Updates occur as though the index was Cartesian, even though the column might contain
# 			a mix of Cartesian and geographical values.
#
# 		) They exist only for backward compatibility; for example, the ability to perform a dump in MySQL
# 			5.7 and restore in MySQL 8.0.
#
# 			Because SPATIAL indexes on columns that are not SRID-restricted are of no use to the optimizer,
# 			each such column should be modified:
#
# 				) Verify that all values within the column have the same SRID.
#
# 					To determine the SRIDs contained in a geometry column col_name, use
# 					the following query:
#
# 						SELECT DISTINCT ST_SRID(col_name) FROM tbl_name;
#
# 					If the query returns more than one row, the column contains a mix of SRIDs.
# 					In that case, modify its contents so all values have the same SRID.
#
# 				) Redefine the column to have an explicit SRID attribute.
#
# 				) Recreate the SPATIAL index.
#
# FOREIGN KEY OPTIMIZATION
#
# If a table has many columns, and you query many different combinations of columns,
# it might be efficient to split the less-frequently used data into separate tables
# with a few columns each, and relate them back to the main table by duplicating the
# numeric ID column from the main table.
#
# That way, each small table can have a primary key for fast lookups of its data,
# and you can query just the set of columns that you need using a join operation.
#
# Depending on how the data is distributed, the queries might perform less I/O
# and take up less cache memory because the relevant columns are packed together
# on disk.
#
# (To maximize performance, queries try to read as few data blocks as possible
# from disk; tables with only a few columns can fit more rows in each data block.)
#
# COLUMN INDEXES
#
# The most common type of index involves a single column, storing copies of the values from
# that column in a data structure, allowing fast lookups for the rows with the corresponding
# column values.
#
# The B-Tree data structure lets the index quickly find a specific value, a set of values,
# or a range of values, corresponding to operators such as =, >, <, BETWEEN, IN and so on,
# in a WHERE clause.
#
# THe maxium number of indexes per table and maximum index length is defiend per storage engine.
#
# See more in THE INNODB STORAGE ENGINE and ALTERNATIVE STORAGE ENGINES
#
# All storage engines support at least 16 indexes per table and a total index length
# of at least 256 bytes.
#
# Most storage engines have higher limits.
#
# For more info on column indexes, more later in CREATE INDEX SYNTAX
#
# INDEX PREFIXES
#
# With col_name(N) syntax in a index specification for a string column, you can create
# an index that uses only the first N characters of the column.
#
# INdexing only a prefix of column values in this way can make the index file much smaller.
#
# When you index a BLOB or TEXT column, you MUST specify a prefix length for the index.
# For example:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, INDEX(blob_col(10)));
#
# Prefixes can be up to  767 bytes long for InnoDB tables that use the REDUNDANT and COMPACT row format.
#
# The prefix length limit is 3072 bytes for InnoDB tables that use the DYNAMIC or COMPRESSED row format.
# For MyISAM tables, the prefix length limit is 1000 bytes.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Prefix limits are measured in bytes, whereas the prefix length in CREATE_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE
# 		and CREATE_INDEX statements is interpreted as number of characters for nonbinary string types
# 		(CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT) and number of bytes for binary string types (BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB)
#
# 		Take this into account when speicfying a prefix length ofr a nonbinary string column
# 		that uses a multibyte character set.
#
# For additional info about index prefixes, more later in CREATE INDEX SYNTAX
#
# FULLTEXT INDEXES
#
# FULLTEXT indexes are used for full-text searches. Only the InnoDB and MyISAM storage engines
# support FULLTEXT indexes and only for CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT columns.
#
# Optimizations are applied to certain kinds of FULLTEXT queries against single InnoDB tables.
# Queries with these characteristics are particularly efficient:
#
# 		) FULLTEXT queries that only return the document ID or the document ID and the search rank.
#
# 		) FULLTEXT queries that sort the matching rows in descending order of score and apply a LIMIT
# 			clause to take the top N matching rows.
#
# 			For this optimization to apply, there must be no WHERE clauses and only a single ORDER BY
# 			clause in desc. order
#
# 		) FULLTEXT queries that retrieve only the COUNT(*) value of rows matching a search term, with no additional
# 			WHERE clauses.
#
# 			Code the WHERE clauses as WHERE MATCH(text) AGAINST ('other_text), without any > 0 comparison operator.
#
# For queries that contain full-text expressions, MySQL evluates those expressions during the optimization
# phase of query execution.
#
# THe optimizer does not just look at full-text expressions and make estimates, it actually evaluates them
# in the process of developing an execution plan.
#
# An implication of this behavior is that EXPLAIN for full-text queries is typically slower
# than for non-full-text queries for which no expression evaluation occurs during the optimization phase.
#
# EXPLAIN for full-text queries may show Select tables optimized away in the Extra column due
# to matching occurring during optimization, in this case, no table access need occur during
# later execution.
#
# SPATIAL INDEXES
#
# You can create indexes on spatial data types.
# MyISAM and InnoDB support R-Tree indexes on spatial types.
#
# Other storage engines use B-trees for indexing spatial types
# (except for ARCHIVE, which does not support spatial type indexing)
#
# INDEXING IN THE MEMORY STORAGE ENGINE
#
# The MEMORY storage engine uses HASH indexes by default, but also supports
# BTREE indexes.
#
# MULTIPLE-COLUMN INDEXES
#
# MySQL can create composite indexes (that is, indexes on multiple columns).
#
# An index may consist of up to 16 columns. For certain data types, you can index a prefix
# of the column (see earlier)
#
# MySQL can use multiple-column indexes fore queries that test all the columns in teh index,
# or queries that test just the first column, the first two columns, the first three
# columns, etc.
#
# IF you specify the columns in the right order in the index definition, a single composite
# index can speed up several kinds of queries on the same table.
#
# A multiple-column index can be considered a sorted array, the rows of which contain values
# that are created by concatenating the values of the indexed columns.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		As an alternative to a composite index, you can introduce a column that is "hashed" based
# 		on information from other columns.
#
# 		If this column is short, reasonably unique and indexed, it might be faster than a "wide"
# 		index on many columns.
#
# 		In MysQL, it is very easy to use this extra column:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 				WHERE hash_col=MD5(CONCAT(val1,val2))
# 				AND col1=val1 AND col2=val2;
#
# SUppose that a table has the following specification:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE test (
# 			id 		INT NOT NULL,
# 			last_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
# 			first_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
# 			PRIMARY KEY (id),
# 			INDEX name (last_name, first_name)
# 		);
#
# The name index is an index over the last name and first name columns.
#
# The index can be used for lookups in queries that specifies values in a known range for 			
# combinations of last_name and first_name values.
#
# It can also be used for queries that specify just a last name value because the column
# is a leftmost prefix of the index (as described later here).
#
# Therefore, teh name index is used for lookups in the following queries:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name='Widenius';
#
# 		SELECT * FROM test
#			WHERE last_name='Widenius' AND first_name='Michael';
#
# 		SELECT * FROM test
# 			WHERE last_name='Widenius'
# 			AND (first_name='Michael' OR first_name='Monty');
#
# 		SELECT * FROM test
# 			WHERE last_name='Widenius'
# 			AND first_name >= 'M' AND first_name < 'N';
#
# However, the name index is NOT used for lookups in the following queries:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM test WHERE first_name='Michael';
#
# 		SELECT * FROM test
# 			WHERE last_name='Widenius' OR first_name='Michael';
#
# Suppose that you issue the following SELECT statement:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 			WHERE col1=val1 AND col2=val2;
#
# If a multiple-column index exists on col1 and col2, the appropriate rows can be fetched directly.
#
# If separate single-column indexes exist on col1 and col2, the optimizer attempts to use
# the Index Merge optimization (SEE INDEX MERGE OPTIMIZATION), or attempts to find the most
# restrictive index by deciding which index excludes more rows and using that index to 
# fetch the rows.
#
# If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the index can be used by the
# optimizer to look up rows.
#
# For example, if you have a three-column index on (col1, col2, col3), you have indexed search
# capabilities on (col1), (col1, col2) and (col1, col2, col3)
#
# MysQL cannot use the index to perform lookups if the columns do not form a leftmost prefix of the index.
# Suppose that you have the SELECT statements shown here:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1;
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1 AND col2=val2;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2;
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2 AND col3=val3;
#
# If an index exists on (col1, col2, col3), only the first two queries use the index.
#
# The first and fourth queries do involve indexes columns, but do not use an index to
# perform lookups because (col2) and (col2, col3) are not leftmost prefixes of (col1, col2, col3)
#
# VERIFYING INDEX USAGE
#
# Always check whether all your queries really use the indexes that you have created in the
# tables.
#
# Use the EXPLAIN statement, as described in OPTIMIZING QUERIES WITH EXPLAIN
#
# INNODB AND MYISAM INDEX STATISTICS COLLECTION
#
# Storage engines collect statitics about tables for use by the optimizer.
#
# Table statistics are based on value groups, where a value group
# is a set of rows with the same key prefix value.
#
# For optimizer purposes, an important statistic is the average value group size.
#
# MySQL uses the average value group size in the following ways:
#
# 		) To estimate how many rows must be read for each ref access.
#
# 		) To estimate how many rows a partial join will produce; that is,
# 			the number of rows that an operation of this form will produce:
#
# 				(---) JOIN tbl_name ON tbl_name.key = expr
#
# As the average value group size for an index increases, the index is less useful
# for those two purposes because the average number of rows per lookup increases:
#
# 		For the index to be good for optimization purposes, it is best that each index
# 		value target a small number of rows in the table.
#
# When a given index value yields a large number of rows, the index is less useful and
# MySQL is less likely to use it.
#
# The average value group size is related to the table cardinality, which is the number
# of value groups.
#
# The SHOW_INDEX statement displays a cardinality value based on N/S, where N is the number
# of rows in the table and S is the average value group size.
#
# That ratio yields the approximate number of value groups in the table.
#
# For a join based on the <=> comparison operator, NULL is not treated differently
# from any other value:
#
# 	NULL <=> NULL, just as N <=> N for any other N.
#
# However, for a join based on the operator of =, NULL is different from non-NULL values:
# 
# 		expr1 = expr2 is not true when expr1 or expr2 (or both) are NULL.
#
# This affects ref accesses for comparisons of the form tbl_name.key = expr:
# MySQL will not access the table if the current value of expr is NULL, because the comparison
# cannot be true.
#
# FOr = comparisons, it does not matter how many NULL values are in the table.
#
# For optimizaton purposes, the relevant value is the average size of the non-NULL value
# groups.
#
# However, MySQL does not currently enable that average size to be collected or used.
#
# For InnoDB and MyISAM tables, you have some control over collection of table stats by means
# of the innodb_stats_method and myisam_stats_method system variables, respectively.
#
# These variables have three possible values, which differ as follows:
#
# 		) When the variable is set to nulls_equal, all NULL values are treated as identical
# 			(that is, they all form a single value group)
#
# 			If the NULL value group size is much higher than the average non-NULL value group size,
# 			this method skews the average value group size upwards.
#
# 			This makes index appear to be the optimizer to be less useful than it really is for joins
# 			that look for non-NULL values.
#
# 			Consequently, the nulls_equal method may cause the optimizer not to use the index
# 			for ref accesses when it should.
#
# 		) When the variable is set to nulls_unequal, NULL values are not considered the same.
#
# 			Instead, each NULL value forms a separate value group of size 1.
#
# 			If you have many NULL values, this method skews the avg. value group downwards.
#
# 			If the average non-null value group size is large, counting NULL values each as a 
# 			group size of 1 causes the optimizer to overestimate the value of the index for joins
# 			that look for non-NULL values.
#
# 			Conseuqently, the nulls_unequal method may cause the optimizer to use this index
# 			for ref lookups when other methods may be beter.
#
# 		) When the variable is set to nulls_ignored, NULL values are ignored.
#
# If you tend to use many joins that use <=> rather than =, NULL values are not special
# in comparisons and one NULL is equal to another.
#
# IN this case, nulls_equal is the appropriate statistics method.
#
# The innodb_stats_method system variable has a global value; the myisam_stats_method
# system variable has both global and session values.
#
# Setting the global value affects statistics collection for tables from the corresponding
# storage engine.
#
# Setting the sesison value affects statistics collection only for the current client connection.
#
# THis means that you can force a tables statistics to be regenerated with a given method without
# affecting other clients by setting the session value of myisam_stats_method
#
# To regenerate MyISAM table statistics, you can use any of the following methods:
#
# 		) Execute myisamchk --stats_method=method_name --analyze
#
# 		) Change the table to cause its statistics to go out of date (for example, insert a row
# 			and then delete it), and then set myisam_stats_method and issue an ANALYZE_TABLE statement.
#
# Some caveats regarding the use of innodb_stats_method and myisam_stats_method:
#
# 		) You can force table statistics to be collected explicitly, as just described.
#
# 			However, MysQL may also collect statistics autoamtically.
#
# 			FOr example, if during the course of executing statements for a table, some of
# 			those statements modify teh table, MySQL may collect statistics.
#
# 		(This may occur for bulk inserts or deletes, or some ALTER_TABLE statements, for example)
#
# 			If this happens, the statistics are collected using whatever value innodb_stats_method
# 			or myisam_stats_method has at the time.
#
# 			Thus, if you collect statistics using one method, but the system variable is set to
# 			the other method when a table's statistics are collected automatically later, the other
# 			method will be used.
#
# 		) There is no way to tell which method was used to generate statitics for a given table.
#
# 		) These variables apply only to InnoDB and MyISAM tables.
#
# 			Other storage engines have only one method for collecting table statistics.
# 			Usually it is closer to the nulls_equal method.
#
# COMPARISON OF B-TREE AND HASH INDEXES
#
# Understanding the B-Tree and hash data structures can help predict how different queries perform
# on different storage engines that use these data structures in their indexes, particularly
# for the MEMORY storage engine that lets you choose B-tree or hash indexes.
#
# B-TREE INDEX CHARACTERISTICS
#
# A B-tree index can be used for column comparisons in expressions that use the =, >, >=, <=, or BETWEEN
# operators.
#
# The index also can be used for LIKE comparisons if the argument to LIKE is a constant string that
# does not start with a wildcard character.
#
# For example, the following SELECT statements use indexes:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE 'Patrick%';
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE 'Pat%_ck%';
#
# In the first statement, only rows with 'Patrick' <= key_col <= 'Patricl' are considered.
# IN the second statement, only rows with 'Pat' <= key_col 'Pau' are considered.
#
# The following SELECT statements do NOT use indexes:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE '%Patrick%';
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE other_col;
#
# IN the first statement, the LIKE value begins with a wildcard char.
# In the second statement, the LIKE value is not a constant.
#
# IF you use --- LIKE '%string%' and string is longer than 3 chars, MySQL uses the Turbo Boyer-Moore algorithm
# to initialize the pattern for the string and then uses this pattern to perform the search more quickly.
#
# A search using col_name IS NULL employs indexes if col_name is indexed.
#
# Any index that does not span all AND levels in the WHERE clause is not used to optimize
# the query.
#
# In other words, to be able to use an index, a prefix of the index must be used in every AND Group.
#
# The following WHERE clauses use indexes:
#
# 		--- WHERE index_part1=1 AND index_part2=2 AND other_column=3
#
# 		/* index = 1 OR index = 2 */
# 	--- WHERE index=1 OR A=10 AND index=2
# 		
# 		/* optimized like "index_part1='hello'" */
# 	--- WHERE index_part1='hello' AND index_part3=5
#
# 		/* Can use index on index1 but not on index2 or index3 */
# 	--- WHERE index1=1 AND index2=2 OR index1=3 AND index3=3;
#
# These where clauses do NOT use indexes:
#
# 		/* index_part1 is not used */
# 		--- WHERE index_part2=1 AND index_part3=2
#
# 		/* Index is not used in both parts of the WHERE clause */
# 		--- WHERE index=1 OR A=10
#
# 		/* No index spans all rows */
# 		--- WHERE index_part1=1 OR index_part2=10
#
# Sometimes MySQL does not use an index, even if one is available.
#
# One circumstance under which this occurs is when the optimizer estimates that using
# the index would require MysQL to access a very large percentage of the orws in the table.
#
# (In this case, a table scan is likely to be much faster, because it requires fewer seeks)
#
# However, if such a query uses LIMIT to retrieve only some of the rows, MysQL uses an index anyway.
# Because it can much more quickly find the few rows to return in the result.
#
# HASH INDEX CHARACTERISTICS
#
# Hash indexes have somewhat different characteristics from those just discussed:
#
# 		) They are used only for equality comparisons that use the = or <=> operators (but they are very fast).
#
# 			They are not used for comparison operators such as < that find a range of values.
#
# 			Systems that rely on this type of single-value lookup are known as "key-value stores",
# 			to use MySQL for such applications, use hash indexes wherever possible.
#
# 		) The optimizer cannot use a hash index to speed up ORDER BY operations. (This type of index cannot be used to search for the next entry in order)
#
# 		) MySQL cannot determine approximately how many rows there are between two values (this is used by the range optimizer to decide which index
# 			to use)
#
# 			This may affect some queries if you change a MyISAM or InnoDB table to a hash-indexed MEMORY table.
#
# 		) Only whole keys can be used to search for a row. (with a B-tree index, any leftmost prefix of the key can be used to find rows).
#
# USE OF INDEX EXTENSIONS
#
# InnoDB automatically extends each secondary index by appending the primary key columns to it.
# Consider this table definition:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 			i1 INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
# 			i2 INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
# 			d DATE DEFAULT NULL,
# 			PRIMARY KEY (i1, i2),
# 			INDEX k_d (d)
# 		) ENGINE = InnoDB;
#
# This table defines the primary key on columns (i1, i2).
#
# It also defines a secondary index k_d on column (d), but internally, InnoDB extends this index and treats
# it as (d, i1, i2)
#
# THe optimizer takes into account the primary key columns of the extended secondary index when determining
# how and whether to use that index.
#
# This can result in more efficient query execution plans and better performance.
#
# The optimizer can use extended secondary indexes for ref, range, and index_merge index access,
# for Loose Index Scan access, for join and sorting optimization and for MIN()/MAX() optimization.
#
# THe following example shows how execution plans are affected by whether the optimizer uses extended
# secondary indexes.
#
# Suppose that t1 is populated with these rows:
#
# 		INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
# 		(1, 1, '1998-01-01'), (1,2, '1999-01-01'),
# 		etc.
#
# Now consider this query:
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 WHERE i1 = 3 AND d = '2000-01-01'
#
# The optimizer cannot use the primary key in this case because that comprises columns
# (i1, i2) and the query does not refer to i2.
#
# Instead, the optimizer can use the secondary_index k_d on (d), and the execution plan
# depends on whether the extended index is used.
#
# WHen the optimizer does not consider index extensions, it treats the index k_d as only (d).
# EXPLAIN for the query produces this result:
#
# EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 WHERE i1 = 3 AND d = '2000-01-01'\G
# ************************ 1. row ***********************************
#
# 								id: 1
# 					select_type: SIMPLE
# 							table: t1
# 							type : ref
# 				possible_keys : PRIMARY,k_d
# 							  key: k_d
# 					    key_len: 4
#  						  ref: const
# 							rows : 5
# 						  Extra : Using where; Using index
#
# When the optimizer takes index extensions into account, it treats k_d as (d, i1, i2).
#
# In this case, it can use the leftmost index prefix (d, i1) to produce a better execution plan:
#
# EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 WHERE i1 = 3 AND d = '2000-01-01'\G
# ************************* 1. row **********************************
# 
# 								 id: 1
# 					 select_type: SIMPLE
# 						table    : t1
# 							type  : ref
# 				possible_keys  : PRIMARY, k_d
# 								key: k_d
# 						key_len  : 8
# 							   ref: const, const
# 							  rows: 1
# 							Extra : Using index
#
# In both cases, key indicates that the optimizer will use secondary index k_d but the EXPLAIN
# output shows these improvements from using the extended index:
#
# 		) key_len goes from 4 bytes to 8, indicating that key lookups use column d and i1, not just d
#
# 		) The ref value changes from const to const, const because the key lookup uses two key parts, not one.
#
# 		) The rows count decreased from 5 to 1, indicating that InnoDB should need to examine fewer rows to produce the result.
#
# 		) The Extra value changes from Using where; Using index to Using index.
#
# 			This means that rows can be read using only the index, without consulting
# 			columns in the data row.
#
# Differences in optimizer behavior for use of extended indexes can also be seen with
# SHOW_STATUS:
#
# FLUSH TABLE t1;
# FLUSH STATUS;
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 WHERE i1 = 3 AND d = '2000-01-01'
# SHOW STATUS LIKE 'handler_read%'
#
# The preceding statements include FLUSH_TABLES and FLUSH_STATUS to flush the table cache and
# clear the status counters.
#
# Without index extensions, SHOW_STATUS produces this result:
#
# 		+-------------------------+------+
# 		| Variable_name 			  | Value|
# 		+-------------------------+------+
# 		| Handler_read_first 	  | 0 	|
# 		| Handler_read_key 		  | 1 	|
# 		| Handler_read_last 		  | 0    |
# 		| Handler_read_next 		  | 5    |
# 		| Handler_read_prev 		  | 0    |
# 		| Handler_read_rnd 		  | 0    |
# 		| Handler_read_rnd_next   | 0    |
#  	+-------------------------+------+
#
# With index extensions, SHOW STATUS produces this result.
#
# The Handler_read_next value decreases from 5 to 1, indicating more efficient use of the index:
#
# 		+-------------------------+-------+
# 		| Variable_name 			  | Value |
# 		+-------------------------+-------+
# 		| Handler_read_first 	  | 0     |
# 		| Handler_read_key 		  | 1 	 |
# 		| Handler_read_last 		  | 0     |
# 		| Handler_read_next 		  | 1     |
# 		| Handler_read_prev 		  | 0     |
# 		| Handler_read_rnd 		  | 0     |
# 		| Handler_read_rnd_next   | 0     |
# 		+-------------------------+-------+
#
# THe use_index_extensions flag of the optimizer_switch system variable permits control over whether the
# optimizer takes the primary key columns into account when determining how to use an InnoDB table's
# secondary indexes.
#
# By default, use_index_extensions is enabled.
#
# TO check whether disable use of index extensions will improve performance, use this statement:
#
# 		SET optimizer_switch = 'use_index_extensions=off';
#
# Use of index extensions by the optimizer is subject to the usual limits on the number of key parts
# in an index (16) and the max key length (3072 bytes)
#
# OPTIMIZER USE OF GENERATED COLUMN INDEXES
#
# MySQL supports indexes on generated columns.
#
# for example:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (f1 INT, gc INT AS (f1 + 1) STORED, INDEX (gc));
#
# The generated column, gc, is defined as the expression f1 +1.
#
# The column is also indexed and the optimizer can take that index into account during
# execution plan construction.
#
# In the following query, the WHERE clause refers to gc and the optimizer considers whether
# the index on that column yields a more efficient plan:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE gc > 9;
#
# The optimizer can use indexes on generated columns to generate execution plans, even in teh absence
# of direct references in queries to those columns by name.
#
# This occurs if the WHERE, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause refers to an expression that matches the definition
# of some indexed generated column.
#
# The following query does not refer directly to gc, but does use an expression that matches the definition of gc:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE f1 + 1 > 9;
#
# The optimizer recognizes that hte expression f1 + 1 matches the definition of gc and that gc is indexed,
# so it considers that index during execution plan construction.
#
# You can see this using EXPLAIN:
#
# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE f1 + 1 > 9\G
# ************************* 1. row ***************************
#
# 						id: 1
# 			select_type: SIMPLE
# 					table: t1
# 			partitions : NULL
# 					type : range
# 		possible_keys : gc
# 					  key: gc
# 				key_len : 5
# 				     ref: NULL
# 				    rows: 1
# 				filtered: 100.00
# 				   Extra: Using index condition
#
# In effect, the optimizer has replaced the expression f1 +1 with the name of the generated column that
# matches the expression.
#
# THis is also apparent in the rewritten query available in teh extended EXPLAIN information displayed
# by SHOW_WARNINGS:
#
# SHOW WARNINGS\G
# *********************** 1. row ***********************
#
# 	 Level: Note
# 	  Code: 1003
# Message: /* select#1 */ select `test`.`t1`.`f1` AS `f1`, `test`.`t1`.`gc`
# 				AS `gc` from `test`.`t1` where (`test`.`t1`.`gc` > 9)
#
# The following restrictions and conditions apply to the optimizer's use of generated column indexes:
#
# 		) For a query expression to match a generated column definition, the expression must be identical
# 			and it must have the same result type.
#
# 			For example, if the generated column expressions f1 + 1, the optimizer will not recognize
# 			a match if the query uses 1 + f1, or if f1 + 1 (an integer exp.) is compared with a string.
#
# 		) The optimization applies to these operators: =, <, <=, >, >=, BETWEEN and IN().
#
# 			For operators other than BETWEEN and IN(), either operand can be replaced by a matching generated column.
#
# 			For BETWEEN and IN(), only the first argument can be replacted by a matching generated column, and the
# 			other arguments must have the same result type.
#
# 			BETWEEN and IN() are not yet supported for comparisons involving JSON values.
#
# 		) The generated column must be defined as an expression that contains at least a function call or one
# 			of the operators mentioned in the preceding item.
#
# 			The expression cannot consist of a simple reference to another column.
#
# 			For example, gc INT AS (f1) STORED consists only of a column reference, so indexes on gc are not
# 			considered.
#
# 		) For comparisons of strings to indexed generated columns that compute a value from a JSON function that
# 			returns a quoted string, JSON_UNQUOTE() is needed in the column definition to remove the extra quotes
# 			from the function value.
#
# 			(For direct comparison of a string to the function result, the JSON comparator handles quote removal,
# 			but this does not occur for index lookups).
#
# 			For example, instead of writing a column definition like this:
#
# 				doc_name TEXT AS (JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name')) STORED
#
# 			Write it like this:
#
# 				doc_name TEXT AS (JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name'))) STORED
#
# 			With the latter definition, the optimizer can detect a match for both of thse comparisons:
#
# 				--- WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name') = 'some_string' ---
# 				--- WHERE JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name')) = 'some_string' ---
#
# 			Without JSON_UNQUOTE() in the column definition, the optimizer detects a match only for the first of those comparisons.
#
# 		) If the optimizer picks the wrong index, an index hint can be used to disable it and force the optimizer
# 			to make a different choice.
#
# INVISIBLE INDEXES
#
# MysQL supports invisible indexes; that is, indexes that are not used by the optimizer.
#
# The feature applies to indexes other than primary keys (either explicit or implicit)
#
# Indexes are visible by default.
#
# TO control Index visibility explicitly for a new index, use a VISIBLE or INVISIBLE keyword
# as part of the index definition for CREATE_TABLE, CREATE_INDEX, or ALTER_TABLE.
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 			i INT,
# 			j INT,
# 			k INT,
# 			INDEX i_idx (i) INVISIBLE
# 		) ENGINE = InnoDB;
# 		CREATE INDEX j_idx ON t1 (j) INVISIBLE;
# 		ALTER TABLE t1 ADD INDEX k_idx (k) INVISIBLE;
#
# To alter the visibility of an existing index, use a VISIBLE or INVISIBLE keyword with the ALTER TABLE --- ALTER INDEX operation:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER INDEX i_idx INVISIBLE;
# 		ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER INDEX i_idx VISIBLE;
#
# Information about whether an index is visible or invisible is available from the
# INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS table or SHOW_INDEX output.
#
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT INDEX_NAME, IS_VISIBLE
# 		FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS
# 		WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'db1' AND TABLE_NAME = 't1';
# 		+-----------------------------+
# 		| INDEX_NAME 	| 	IS_VISIBLE  |
# 		+--------------+--------------+
# 		| í_idx 			| YES 			|
# 		| j_idx 			| NO 				|
# 		| k_idx 			| NO 				|
# 		+--------------+--------------+
#
# Invisible indexes make it possible to test the effect of removing an index on query performance,
# without making a destructive change that must be undone should the index turn out to be required.
#
# Dropping and re-adding an index can be expensive for a large table, whereas making it invisible and
# visible - are fast in-place operations.
#
# If an index made invisible actually is needed or used by the optimizer,
# there are several ways to notice the effect of its absence on queries for the table:
#
# 		) Errors occur for queries that include index hints that refer to the invisible index
#
# 		) Performance Schema data shows an increase in workload for affected queries.
#
# 		) Queries have different EXPLAIN execution plans.
#
# 		) Queries appear in the slow query log that did not appear there previously.
#
# The use_invisible_indexes flag of the optimizer_switch system variable controls whether the optimizer
# uses invisible indexes for query execution plan construction.
#
# If the flag is off (the default), the optimizer ignores invisible indexes (the same behavior as prior
# to the introduction of this flag).
#
# If the flag is on, invisible indexes remain invisible but the optimizer takes them into account for execution
# plan construction.
#
# Index visibility does not affect index maintenance. For example, an index continues to be updated
# per changes to the table rows, and a unique index prevents insertion of duplicates into a column,
# regardless of whether the index is visible or invisible.
#
# A table with no explicit primary key may still have an effective implicit primary key if it has any UNIQUE
# indexes on NOT NULL.
#
# In this case, the first such index places the same constraint on table rows as an explicit
# primary key and that index cannot be made invisible.
#
# Consider the following table definition:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t2 (
# 			i INT NOT NULL,
# 			j INT NOT NULL,
# 			UNIQUE j_idx (j)
# 		) ENGINE = InnoDB;
#
# The definition includes no explicit primary key, but hte index on NOT NULL column j places the same
# constraint on rows as a primary key, and cannot be made invisible:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t2 ALTER INDEX j_idx INVISIBLE;
# 		ERROR 3522 (HY000): A primary key index cannot be invisible.
#
# Now suppose that an explicit primary key is added to the table:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t2 ADD PRIMARY KEY (i);
#
# The explicit primary key cannot be made invisible.
#
# In addition, the unique key index on j no longer acts as an implicit primary key and
# as a result can be made invisible:
#
# ALTER TABLE t2 ALTER INDEX j_idx INVISIBLE;
# Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
#
# DESCENDING INDEXES
#
# MySQL supports descending indexes: DESC in a index definition is no longer ignored but causes
# storage of key values in desc. order.
#
# Previously, indexes could be scanned in reverse order but at a performance penalty.
#
# A descending index can be scanned in forward order, which is more efficient.
#
# Descending indexes also make it possible for the optimizer to use multiple-column indexes when the
# most efficient scan order mixes ascending order for some columns and descending order for others.
#
# Consider the following table definition, which contains two columns and four two-column index definitions
# for the various combinations of ascending and descending indexes on the columns:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t (
# 			c1 INT, c2 INT,
# 			INDEX idx1 (c1 ASC, c2 ASC),
# 			INDEX idx2 (c1 ASC, c2 DESC),
# 			INDEX idx3 (c1 DESC, c2 ASC),
# 			INDEX idx4 (c1 DESC, c2 DESC)
# 		);
#
# The table definition results in four distinct indexes.
#
# The optimizer can perform a forward index scan for each of the ORDER BY clauses and
# need not use a filesort operation:
# 
# ORDER BY c1 ASC, c2 ASC -- optimizer can use idx1
# ORDER BY c1 DESC, c2 DESC -- optimizer can use idx4
# ORDER BY c1 ASC, c2 DESC -- Optimizer can use idx2
# ORDER BY c1 DESC, c2 ASC -- optimizer  can use idx3
#
# Use of descending index is subject to these conditions:
#
# 		) Descending index are supported only for the InnoDB storage engine, with these limitations:
#
# 			) Change buffering is not supported for a secondary index if the index contains a descending
# 				index key column or if the primary key includes a descending index column.
#
# 			) The InnoDB SQL parser does not use descending indexes.
#
# 				For InnoDB full-text search, this means that the index required on the FTS_DOC_ID column of the
# 				indexed table cannot be defined as a descending index.
#
# 				For more information, see more later under INNODB FULLTEXT INDEXES
#
# 		) Descending indexes are supported for all data types for which ascending indexes are available.
#
# 		) Descending indexes are supported for ordinary (nongenerated) and genrated columns (both VIRTUAL and STORED)
#
# 		) DISTINCT can use any index containing matching columns, including descending key parts.
#
# 		) Indexes that have descending key parts are not used for MIN()/MAX() optimization of queries that invoke aggregate
# 			functions but do not have a GROUP BY clause.
#
# 		) Descending indexes are supported for BTREE but not HASH indexes. Descending indexes are not supported
# 			for FULLTEXT or SPATIAL indexes.
#
# 			Explicitly specified ASC and DESC designators for HASH, FULLTEXT, and SPATIAL indexes result in an error.
#
# OPTIMIZING DATABASE STRUCTURE
#
# In your role as DB designer, look for the most efficient way to organize your schemas, tables and columns.
# As when tuning application code, you can minimize I/O, keep related items together, and plan ahead
# so that performance stays high as the data volume increases.
#
# Starting with an efficient database design make it easier for team members to write high-performing
# application code, and makes the database likely to endure as applications evolve and are rewritten.
#
# OPTIMIZING DATA SIZE
#
# Design your tables to minimize their space on the disk.
# This can result in huge improvements by reducing the amount of data written to and read from disk.
#
# Smaller tables normally require less main memory while their contents are being actively processed
# during query execution.
#
# Any space reduction for table data also results in smaller indexes that can be processed faster.
#
# MysQL supports many different storage engines (table types) and row formats.
# For each table, you can decide which storage and indexing method to use.
#
# Choosing the proper table format for your application can give you a big performance gain.
#
# See more later in THE INNODB STORAGE ENGINE and ALTERNATIVE STORAGE ENGINES
#
# You can get better performance for a table and minimize storage space by using the techniques
# listed here:
#
# 		) TABLE COLUMNS
#
# 		) ROW FORMAT
#
# 		) INDEXES
#
# 		) JOINS
#
# 		) NORMALIZATION
#
# TABLE COLUMNS
#
# 		) use the most efficient (smallest) data types possible.
#
# 			MySQL has many specialized types that save disk space and memory.
# 			For example, use the smaller integer types if possible to get smaller tables.
#
# 			MEDIUMINT is often better of a choice than INT because MEDIUMINT columns use 25% less space.
#
# 		) Declare columns to be NOT NULL if possible.
#
# 			It makes SQL operations faster, by enabling better use of indexes and eliminating overhead for testing
# 			whether each value is NULL.
#
# 			You also save some storage space, one bit per column.
#
# 			If you really need NULL values in your tables, use them.
# 			Just avoid the default setting that allows NULL values in every column.
#
# ROW FORMAT
#
# 		) InnoDB tables are created using the DYNAMIC row format by default.
# 			To use a row format other than DYNAMIC, configure innodb_default_row_format,
# 			or specify the ROW_FORMAT option explicitly in a CREATE_TABLE or ALTER_TABLE statement.
#
# 			The compact family of row formats, which includes COMPACT, DYNAMIC, and COMPRESSED,
# 			decreases row storage space at the cost of increasing CPU use for some operations.
#
# 			If your workload is a typical one that is limited by cache hit rates and disk speed
# 			it is likely to be faster.
#
# 			If it is a rare case taht is limited by CPU speed, it might be slower.
#
# 			The compact family of row formats also optimizes CHAR column storage when using a 
# 			variable-length character set such as utf8mb3 or utf8mb4.
#
# 			With ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT, CHAR(N) occupies N x the max byte length of the char set.
#
# 			Many languages can be written primarly using a single-byte utf8 chars, so a fixed storage
# 			length often wastes space.
#
# 			With the compact family of row formats, InnoDB allocates a variable amount of storage
# 			in teh range of N to N x the max byte length of char set for these columns by stripping trailing spaces.
#
# 			The minimum storage length is N bytes to facilitate in-place updates in typical cases.
#
# 			For more information, see later under THE PHYSICAL ROW STRUCTURE OF AN INNODB TABLE
#
# 		) To minimize space even further by storing table data in compressed form, specify ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED
# 			when creating InnoDB tables, or run the myisampack command on an existing MyISAM table.
#
# 			(InnoDB compressed tables are readable and writable, while MyISAM compressed tables are read only)
#
# 		) For MyISAM tables, if you do not have any variable-length columns (VARCHAR, TEXT or BLOB columns),
# 			A fixed-size row foramt is used.
#
# 			This is faster but may waste some space.
#
# 			More later under MyISAM TABLE STORAGE FORMATS.
#
# 			You can hint that you want to have fixed length rows even if you have VARCHAR columns
# 			with the CREATE_TABLE option ROW_FORMAT=FIXED
#
# INDEXES
#
# 		) The primary index of a table should be as short as possible.
#
# 			This makes identification of each row easy and efficient.
#
# 			For InnoDB tables, the primary key columns are duplicated in each secondary
# 			index entry, so a short primary key saves considerable space if you have
# 			many secondary indexes.
#
# 		) Create only the indexes that you need to improve query performance.
#
# 			Indexes are good for retreival, but slow down insert and update operations.
#
# 			If you access a table mostly by searching on a combination of columns,
# 			create a single composite index on them rather than a separate index for each column.
#
# 			The first part of the index should be the column most used.
#
# 			If you ALWAYS use many columns when selecting from the table, the first column in the index
# 			should be the one with the most duplicates to obtain better compression of the index.
#
# 		) If it is very likely that a long string column has a unique prefix on the first number of characters,
# 			it is better to index only this prefix, using MySQL's support for creating an index on the leftmost
# 			part of the column.
#
# 			See more under CREATE INDEX SYNTAX.
#
# 			Shorter indexes are faster, not only because they require less disk space,
# 			but because they also give you more hits in teh index cache, and thus fewer disk seeks.
#
# 			See configuring the server.
#
# JOINS
#
# 		) In some circumstances, it can be beneficial to split into two a table that is scanned very often
#.
# 			This is especially true if it is a dynamic-format table and it is possible to use a 
# 			smaller static format table that can be used to find the relevant rows when scanning the table. 	
#
# 		) Declare columns with identical information in different tables with identical data types, to speed up
# 			joins based on the corresponding columns.
#
# 		) Keep column names simple, so that you can use the same name across different tables and simplify join queries.
# 			For example, in a table named customer, use a column name of name instead of customer_name.
#
# 			To make your names portable to other SQL servers, consider keeping them shorter than 18 chars.
#
# NORMALIZATION
#
# 		) Normally, try to keep all data nonredundant (observing what is referred to in database theory as third normal form).
#
# 			Instead of repeating lengthy values such as names and addresses, assign them unique IDs, repeat these IDs as needed
# 			across multiple smaller tables, and join the tables in queries by referencing the IDs in the join clause.
#
# 		) If speed is more important than disk space and the maintenance costs of keeping multiple copies of data,
# 		for example in a business intelligence scenario where you analyze all the data from large tables,
# 		you can relax the normalization rules, duplicating information or creating summary tables to gain more speed.
#
# OPTIMIZING MYSQL DATA TYPES
#
# OPTIMIZING FOR NUMERIC DATA
#
# 		) For unique IDs or other values that can be represented as either strings or numbers, prefer numeric columns
# 			to string columns.
#
# 			Since large numeric values can be stored in fewer bytes than the corresponding strings, it is faster
# 			and takes less memory to transfer and compare them.
#
# 		) If you are using numeric data, it is faster in many cases to access information from a database (using a live connection)
# 			than to access a text file.
#
# 			Information in the DB is likely to be stored in a more compact format than in the text file,
# 			so accessing involves fewer disk accesses.
#
# 			You can also save code in our application because you can avoid parsing the text file to find line
# 			and column boundaries.
#
# OPTIMIZING FOR CHARACTER AND STRING TYPES
#
#  For character and string columns, follow these guidelines:
#
# 		) Use binary collation order for fast comparison and sort operations,
# 			when you do not need language-specific collation features.
#
# 			You can use the BINARY operators to use binary collation within a particular query.
#
# 		) When comparing values from different columns, declare those columns with the same character
# 			set and collation wherever possible, to avoid string conversions while running the query.
#
# 		) For column values less than 8kb in size, use binary VARCHAR instead of BLOB.
#
# 			The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses can generate temporary tables, and these temporary
# 			tables can use the MEMORY storage engine if the original table does not contain any
# 			BLOB columns.
#
# 		) If a table contains string columns such as name and address, but many queries do not retrieve
# 			those columns, consider splitting the string columns into a separate table and using join queries
# 			with a foreign key when necessary.
#
# 			When MySQL retrieves any value from a row, it reads a data block containing all the columns of that row
# 			(and possibly other adjancet rows)
#
# 			Keeping each row small, with only the most frequently used columns, allows more rows to fit in each
# 			data block.
#
# 			Such compact tables reduce disk I/O and memory usage for common queries.
#
# 		) When oyu use a randomly generated value as a primary key in a InnoDB table, prefix it
# 			with an ascending value such as the current date and time if possible.
#
# 			When consecutive primary values are physically stored near each other, InnoDB
# 			can insert and retrieve them faster.
#
# 		) See OPTIMIZING FOR NUMERIC DATA to see why numeric columns are preferable to an equivalent string column.
#
# OPTIMIZING FOR BLOB TYPES
#
# 		) When storing a large blob containing textual data, consider compressing it first.
#
# 			Do not use this technique when the entire table is compresed by InnoDB or MyISAM.
#
# 		) For a table with several columns, to reduce memory requirements for queries that do not use
# 			the BLOB column, consider splitting the BLOB column into a separate table and referencing
# 			it with a join query when needed.
#
# 		) Since the performance requirements to retrieve and display a BLOB value might be very different
# 			from other data types, you could put the BLOB-specific table on a different storage device or
# 			even a separate database instance.
#
# 			For example, to retrieve a BLOB might require a large sequential disk read that is better suited
# 			to a traditional hard drive than to an SSD device.
#
# 		) See OPTIMIZING FOR CHARACTER AND STRING TYPES for reasons why a binary VARCHAR column is sometimes
# 			preferable to an equivalent BLOB column.
#
# 		) Rather than testing for equality against a very long text string, you can store a hash of the column
# 			value in a separate column, index that column, and test the hashed values in queries.
#
# 			(Use the MD5() or CRC32() function to produce the hash value.)
#
# 			Since hash functions can produce duplicate results for different inputs, you still
# 			include a clause AND blob_column = long_string_value in the query to guard against
# 			false matches.
#
# 			The performance benefit comes from the smaller, easily scanned index for the hashed values.
#
# OPTIMIZING FOR MANY TABLES
#
# Some techniques for keeping individual queries fast involve splitting data across many tables.
#
# When the number of tables run into the thousands or even millions, the overhead of dealing with
# all these tables become a new performance consideration.
#
# HOW MYSQL OPENS AND CLOSES TABLES
#
# When you execute a mysqladmin status command, you should see something like this:
#
# 		Uptime: 426 Running threads: 1 Questions: 11082
# 		Reloads: 1 Open tables: 12
#
# The Open tables value of 12 can be somewhat puzzling if you have fewer than 12 tables.
#
# MySQL is multithreaded, so there may be many clients issuing queries for a given table simultaneously.
#
# To minimize the problem with multiple client sessions having different states on the same table,
# the table is opened independently by each concurrent session.
#
# This uses additional memory but normally increaases performance.
#
# With MyISAM tables, one extra file descriptor is required for the data file for each client that
# has the table open. (By contrast, the index file descriptor is shared between all sessions)
#
# The table_open_cache and max_connections system variables affect the maximum number of files the server
# keeps open.
#
# If you increase one or both of these values, you may run up against a limit imposed by your operating system
# on the per-process number of open file descriptors.
#
# Many operating systems permit you to increase the open-files limit, although the method varies widely from
# system to system.
#
# Consult your OS documentation to determine whether it is possible to increaase the limit and how to do so.
#
# table_open_cache is related to max_connections.
#
# For example, for 200 concurrent running connections, specify a table cache size of at least 200 * N,
# where N is the maximum number of tables per join in any of the queries which you execute.
#
# You must also reserve some extra file descriptors for temporary tables and files.
#
# Make sure that your operating system can handle the number of open file descriptors implied by the table_open_cache
# setting.
#
# If table_open_cache is set too high, MySQL may run out of file descriptors and exhibit symptoms such as refusing
# connections or failing to perform queries.
#
# Also take into account that the MyISAM storage engine needs two file descriptors for each unique open table.
#
# To increase the number of file descriptors available to MySQL, use the --open-files-limit startup option to
# mysqld.
#
# SEE MORE UNDER FILE NOT FOUND AND SIMILAR ERRORS.
#
# The cache of open tables is kept at a level of table_open_cache entries. 
# The server autosizes the cache size at startup.
#
# To set the size explicitly, set the table_open_cache system variable at startup.
#
# MySQL may temporarily open more tables than this to execute queries, as described later in this section.
#
# MySQL closes an unused table and removes it from the table cache under the following circumstances:
#
# 		) WHen the cache is full and a thread tries to open a table that is not in the cache
#
# 		) When the cache contains more than table_open_cache entries and a table in the cache is no longer being
# 			used by any threads.
#
# 		) When a table-flushing operation occurs. This happens when someone issues a FLUSH_TABLES statement
# 			or executes a mysqladmin flush-tables or mysqladmin refresh command.
#
# When the table cache fills up, the server uses the following procedure to locate a cache entry to use:
#
# 		) Tables not currently in use are released, beginning with the table least recently used.
#
# 		) If a new table must be opened, but the cache is full and no tables can be released, the cache is temporarily
# 			extended as necessary.
#
# 			When the cache is in a temporary extended state and a table goes from a used to unused state, the table
# 			is closed and released from the cache.
#
# A MyISAM table is opened for each concurrent access.
#
# This means the table needs to be opened twice if two threads access the same table or if a thread
# accesses the table twice in the same query (for example, by joining the table to itself)
#
# Each concurrent open requires an entry in the table cache. 
#
# The first open of any MyISAM table takes two file descriptors: one for the data file and one
# for the index file.
#
# Each additional use of the table takes only one file descriptor for the data file.
#
# The index file descriptor is shared among all threads.
#
# If you are opening a table with the HANDLER tbl_name OPEN statement, a dedicated table object
# is allocated for the thread.
#
# This table object is not shared by other threads and is not closed until the thread calls HANDLER tbl_name CLOSE
# or the thread terminates.
#
# When this happens, the table is put back in the table cache (if the cache is not full), SEE MORE LATER IN THE HANDLER SYNTAX
#
# To determine whether your table cache is too small, check the Opened_tables status variable,
# which indicates the number of table-opening operations since the server started:
#
# 		SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Opened_tables';
# 		+--------------------------------------+
# 		| Variable_name 			| Value 		   |
# 		+--------------------------------------+
# 		| Opened_tables 			| 2741 			|
# 		+--------------------------------------+
#
# If the value is very large or increases rapidly, even when you have not issued
# many FLUSH_TABLES statements, increase the table_open_cache value at server startup.
#
# DISADVANTAGES OF CREATING MANY TABLES IN THE SAME DATABASE
#
# If you have many MyISAM tables in the same database directory, open, close and create operations are slow.
#
# IF you execute SELECT statements on many different tables, there is little overhead when the table cache is full,
# because for every table that has to be opened, another must be closed.
#
# You can reduce this overhead by increasing the number of entries permitted in the table cache.
#
# INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLE USE IN MYSQL
#
# In some cases, the server creates internal temporary tables while processing statements.
# Users have no direct control over when this occurs.
#
# The server creates temporary tables under conditions such as these:
#
# ) Evaluation of UNION statements, with some exceptions described later.
#
# ) Evaluation of some views, such those that use the TEMPTABLE algorithm, UNION or aggreggation
#
# ) Evaluation of derived  tables (MORE LATER IN DERIVED TABLES)
#
# ) Evaluation of common table expressions (SEE WITH SYNTAX (COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS) LATER)
#
# ) Tables created for subquery or semi-join materialization (SEE OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES, DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES, AND COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS LATER)
#
# ) Evaluation of statements that contain an ORDER BY clause and a different GROUP BY clause, or for which the
# 		ORDER BY or GROUP BY contains columns from tables other than the first table in the join queue.
#
# ) Evaluation of DISTINCT combined with ORDER BY may require a temporary table
#
# ) For queries that use the SQL_SMALL_RESULT modifier, MySQL uses an in-memory temporary table,
# 		unless the query also contains elements (described later) that require on-disk storage.
#
# ) To evaluate INSERT_---_SELECT statements that select from and insert into the same table, MySQL
# 		creates an internal temporary table to hold the rows from the SELECT, then inserts those
#		rows into the target table. SEE MORE LATER ON INSERT_---_SELECT SYNTAX
#
# ) Evaluation of multiple-table UPDATE statements
#
# ) Evaluation of GROUP_CONCAT() or COUNT(DISTINCT) expressions.
#
# ) Evaluation of window functions (MORE LATER IN WINDOW FUNCTIONS) uses temporary tables as necessary.
#
# To determine whether a statement requires a temporary table, use EXPLAIN and check the Extra column to see
# whether it says Using temporary (SEE UNDER OPTIMIZING WITH EXPLAIN)
#
# EXPLAIN will not nessecarily say Using temporary for derived or materialized temporary tables.
#
# For statements that use window functions, EXPLAIN with FORMAT=JSON always provides information
# about the windowing steps.
#
# If the windowing functions use temporary tables, it is indicated for each step.
#
# When the server creates an internal temporary table (either in memory or on disk),
# it increments the Created_tmp_tables status variable.
#
# If the server creates the table on disk (either initially or by converting an in-memory table),
# it increments the Created_tmp_disk_tables status variable.
#
# Some query conditions prevent the use of an in-memory temporary table, in which case the server
# uses an on-disk table instead:
#
# 		) PResence of a BLOB or TEXT column in teh table.
#
# 			However, the TempTable storage engine, which is the default storage engine for in-memory
# 			internal temporary tables in MySQL 8.0, supports binary large objects as of MySQL 8.0.13
#
# 			More under INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLE STORAGE ENGINE
#
# 		) Presence of any string column with a maximum length larger than 512 (bytes for binary strings, characters
# 			for nonbinary strings) in the SELECT list, if UNION or UNION ALL is used.
#
# 		) The SHOW_COLUMNS and DESCRIBE statements use BLOB as the type for some columns, thus the temporary table used
# 			for the results is an on-disk table.
#
# The server does not use a temporary table for UNION statements that meet certain qualifications.
#
# Instead, it retains from temporary table creation only the data structures necessary to perform
# result column typecasting.
#
# The table is not fully instansiated and no rows are written to or read from it; rows are sent
# directly to the client.
#
# The result is reduced memory and disk requirements, and smaller delay before the first row is sent to client
# because the server need not wait until the last query block is executed.
#
# EXPLAIN and optimizer trace output reflects this execution strat.
#
# The UNION RESULT query block is not present because that block corresponds to the part that reads from the temporary table.
#
# These conditions qualify a UNION for evaluation without a temporary table:
#
# 	) The union is UNION ALL, not UNION or UNION DISTINCT
#
# 	) There is no global ORDER BY clause
#
# 	) The union is not the top-level query block of an {INSERT | REPLACE} --- SELECT --- statement
#
# INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLE STORAGE ENGINE
#
# An internal temporary table can be held in memory and processed by the TempTable or MEMORY storage engine,
# or stored on disk by the InnoDB or MyISAM storage engine.
#
# STORAGE ENGINE FOR IN-MEMORY INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLES
#
# The internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine session variable defines the storage engine for in-memory
# temporary tables.
#
# Permitted values are TempTable (the default) and MEMORY.
#
# The TempTable storage engine provides efficient storage for VARCHAR and VARBINARY columns.
# Storage of other binary large object types is supported qs of 8.0.13
#
# The temptable_max_ram configuration option defines the maximum amount of random access memory
# (RAM) that can be occupied by the TempTable storage engine before it starts allocating space
# from disk in teh form of temporary files that are mapped into memory.
#
# The default temptable_max_ram setting is 1 GIB.
#
# Use of temporary files by the TempTable storage engine as an overflow mechanism for in-memory
# temporary tables is governed by these rules:
#
# ) Temporary files are created in teh directory defined by the tmpdir variable.
#
# ) Temporary files are deleted immediately after they created and opened, and therefore do not
# 		remain visible in the tmpdir directory.
#
# 		The space occupied by temporary files is held by the operating system while temporary files are open.
# 		
# 		The space is reclaimed when temporary files are closed by the TempTable storage engine,
# 		or when the mysqld process is shut down.
#
# ) Data is never moved between RAM and temporary files, within RAM or between temporary files.
#
# ) New data is stored in RAM if space becomes available within the limit defined by temptable_max_ram.
# 		Otherwise, new data is stored in temporary files.
#
# ) If space becomes avaialble in RAM after some of the data for a table is written to temporary files,
# 		it is possible for the remaining table data to be stored in RAM.
#
# The memory/temptable/physical_ram and memory/temptable/physical_disk Performance Schema instruments can
# be used to monitor TempTable space allocation from memory and disk.
#
# memory/temptable/physical_ram reports the amount of allocated RAM.
#
# memory/temptable/physical_disk reports the amount of space allocated from disk.
#
# If the physical_disk instrument reports a value other than 0, the temptable_max_ram threshold
# was reached at some point.
#
# Data can be queried in Performance Schema memory summary tables such as memory_summary_global_by_event_name.
#
# SEE MOATER LATER UNDER MEMORY SUMMARY TABLES
#
# WHen using the MEMORY storage engine for in-memory temporary tables, MySQL automatically converts an in-memory
# temporary table to an on-disk table if it becomes too large.
#
# The maxium size for in-memory temporary tables is defined by the tmp_table_size or max_heap_table_size value,
# whichever is smaller.
#
# This differs from MEMORY tables explicitly created with CREATE_TABLE.
#
# FOr such tables, only the max_heap_table_size variable determines how large a table can grow,
# and there is no conversion to on-disk format.
#
# STORAGE ENGINE FOR ON-DISK INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLES
#
# The internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine variable defines the storage engine the server uses to manage on-disk
# internal temporary tables.
#
# Permitted values are INNODB (default) and MyISAM.
#
# For common table expressions (CTEs), the storage engine used for on-disk internal temporary tables cannot be MyISAM.
#
# If internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine=MYISAM, an error occurs for any attempt to materialize a  CTE using
# an on-disk temporary table.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		When using internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine=INNODB, queries that generate on-disk internal temporary tables
# 		that exceed InnoDB row or column limits returns Row size too large or Too many columns errors.
#
# 		The workaround is to set internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine to MyISAM.
#
# INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLE STORAGE FORMAT
#
# When in-memory internal temporary tables are managed by the TempTable storage engine,
# rows that include VARCHAR columns, VARBINARY columns or other binary large object type
# columns (supported as of 8.0.13) are represented in memory by an array of cells, with each cell
# containing a NULL flag, the data length, and a data pointer.
#
# Column values are placed in consecutive order after the array, in a single region of memory,
# without padding.
#
# Each cell in the array uses 16 bytes of storage. The same storage format applies when the TempTable
# storage engine exceeds the temptable_max_ram limit and starts allocating space from disk in the form
# of temporary files that are mapped into memory.
#
# When in-memory internal temporary tables are managed by the MEMORY storage engine, fixed-length row
# format is used.
#
# VARCHAR and VARBINARY column values are padded to the maximum column length, in effect storing them as
# CHAR and BINARY columns.
#
# On-disk internal temporary tables are managed by the INnoDB or MyISAM storage engine (depending on the 
# internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine setting)
#
# Both engines store internal temporary tables using dynamic-width row format.
#
# Columns take only as much storage as needed, which reduces disk I/O, space requirements, and
# processing time compared to on-disk tables that use fixed-length rows.
#
# When using the MEMORY storage engine, statements can initially create an in-memory internal
# temporary table and then convert it to an on-disk table if the table becomes too large.
#
# In such cases, better performance might be achieved by skipping the conversion and creating
# the internal temporary table on disk to begin with.
#
# THe big_tables variable can be used to force disk storage of internal temporary tables.
#
# OPTIMIZING FOR INNODB TABLES
#
# InnoDB is the storage engine that MySQL customer typically use in production DBs where reliability
# and concurrency are important.
#
# InnoDB is the default storage engine in MySQl. This section explains how to optimize database operations
# for InnoDB tables.
#
# OPTIMIZING STORAGE LAYOUT FOR INNODB TABLES
#
# ) Once your data reaches a stable size, or a growing table has increased by tens or some hundreds of
# 	megabytes, consider using the OPTIMIZE TABLE statement to reorganize the table and compact any wasted space.
#
# 	THe reorganized table require less disk I/O to perform full table scans.
#
# This is a straightforward technique that can improve performance when other techniques such as improving index usage
# or tunning application code are not practical.
#
# 	OPTIMIZE TABLE copies the data part of the table and rebubilds the indexes.
#
# 	The benefits come from improved packing of data within indexes, and reduced
# 	fragmentation within the tablespaces and on disk.
#
# 	The benefits vary depending on the data in each table.
#
# 	You may find that ther are significant gains for some and not for others, or that the gains
# 	decrease over time until you next optimize the table.
#
# 	This operation can be slow if the table is large or if the indexes being rebuilt do not fit
# 	into the buffer pool.
#
# 	The first run after adding a lot of data to a table is often much slower than later runs.
#
# ) In InnoDB, having a long PRIMARY KEY (either single column with a lengthy value, or several columns
# 		that form a long composite value) wastes a lot of disk space.
#
# 		The primary key value for a row is duplicated in all the secondary index records that point to
# 		the same row. (SEE MORE UNDER CLUSTERED AND SECONDARY INDEXES)
#
# 		Create an AUTO_INCREMENT column as the primary key if your primary key is long, or index
# 		a prefix of a long VARCHAR column instead of the entire column.
#
# ) Use the VARCHAR data type instead of CHAR to store variable-length strings or for columns
# 		with many NULL values.
#
# 		A CHAR(N) column always takes N characters to store data, even if the string is shorter
# 		or its value is NULL.
#
# 		Smaller tables fit better in the buffer pool and reduce disk I/O
#
# 		WHen using COMPACT row format (the default InnoDB format) and variable-length character sets,
# 		such as utf8 or sjis, CHAR(N) columns occupy a variable amount of space, but still at least
# 		N bytes.
#
# ) For tables that are big, or contain lots of repetitive text or numeric data,
# 		consider using COMPRESSED row format.
#
# 		Less disk I/O is required to bring data into the buffer pool, or to perform
# 		full table scans.
#
# 		Before making a permanent decision, measure the amount of compression you can achieve
# 		by using COMPRESSED versus COMPACT row format.
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT
#
# To optimize InnoDB transaction processing, find the ideal balance between the performance overhead of
# transactional features and the workload of your server.
#
# For example, an application might encounter performance issues if it commits thousands of times per second,
# and different performance issues if it commits only every 2-3 hours.
#
# ) The default MySQL setting AUTOCOMMIT=1 can impose performance limitation on a busy DB server.
#
# 		Where practical, wrap several related data change operations into a single transaction,
# 		by issuing SET AUTOCOMMIT=0 or a START TRANSACTION statement, followed by a COMMIT statement
# 		after making all the changes.
#
# 		InnoDB must flush the log to disk at each transaction commit if that transaction made modifications
# 		to the database.
#
# 		When each change is followed by a commit (as with the default autocommit setting), the I/O throughput
# 		of the storage device puts a cap on the number of potentional operations per second.
#
# ) Alternatively, for transactions that consist only of a single SELECT statement, turning on AUTOCOMMIT
# 		helps InnoDB to recognize read-only transactions and optimize them.
#
# 		SEE OPTIMIZING INNODB READ-ONLY TRANSACTIONS later, for the requirements of this.
#
# ) Avoid performing rollbacks after inserting, updating or deleting huge numbers of rows.
#
# 		If a big transaction is slowing down server performance, rolling it back can make
# 		the problem worse, potentionally taking several times as long to perform as the
# 		original data change operations.
#
# 		Killing the DB process does not help, because the rollback starts again on server startup.
#
# 		To minimize the chance of this issue occurring:
#
# 			 ) Increase the size of the buffer pool so that all data change changes can be cached rather
#				than immediately written to disk.
#
# 			) Set innodb_change_buffering=all so that update and delete operations are buffered in addition to inserts.
#
# 			) Consider issuing COMMIT statements periodically during the big data change operation,
# 			possibly breaking a single delete or update into multiple statements that operate
# 			on smaller number of rows.
#
# 		To get rid of a runaway rollback once it occurs, increase the buffer pool so that the rollback
# 		becomes CPU-bound and runs fast, or kill the server and restart with innodb_force_recovery=3,
# 		as explained in INNODB RECOVERY 
#
# 		The issue is expected to be infrequent with the defualt setting innodb_change_buffering=all, which 
# 		allows update and delete operations to be cached in memory, making them faster to perform in
# 		the first place, and also faster to roll back if needed.
#
# 		Make sure to use this parameter setting on servers that process long-running transactions
# 		with many inserts, updates or deletes.
#
# ) If you can afford the loss of some of the latest committed transactions if a crash occurs,
# 		you can set the innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit parameter to 0.
#
# 		InnoDB tries to flush the log once per second anyway, although the flush is not guaranteed.
#
# ) WHen rows are modified or deleted, the rows and associated undo logs are not physically removed immediately,
# 		or even immediately after the transaction commits.
#
# 		The old data is preserved until transactions that started earlier or concurrently are finished,
# 		so that those transactions can access the previous state of modified or deleted rows.
#
# 		Thus, a long-running transaction can prevent InnoDB from purging data that was changed by a different transactions.
#
# ) When rows are modified or deleted with a long-running transaction, other transactions using
# 		the READ_COMMITTED and REPEATABLE_READ isolation levels have to do more work to reconstruct the
# 		older data if they read those same rows.
#
# ) When a long running transaction modifies a table, queries against that table from other transactions
# 		do not make use of the covering index technique.
#
# 		Queries that normally could retrieve all the results columns from a secondary index,
# 		instead look up the appropriate values from the table data.
#
# 		If secondary index pages are found to have a PAGE_MAX_TRX_ID that is too new, or if records
# 		in the secondary index are delete-marked, InnoDB may need to look up records using a clustered index.
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB READ-ONLY TRANSACTIONS
#
# InnoDB can avoid the overhead associated with setting up the transaction ID (TRX_ID field)
# for transactions that are known to be read-only.
#
# A transaction ID is only needed for a transaction that might perform write operations or locking
# reads such as SELECT_---_FOR UPDATE.
#
# Eliminating unecessary transaction IDs reduces the size of internal data structures that are
# consulted each time a query or data change statement constructs a read view.
#
# INNODB detects read-only transactions when:
#
# 		) The transaction is started with the START_TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY statement.
#
# 			IN this case, attempting to make changes to the database (for InnoDB, MyISAM or other
# 			types of tables) causes an error, and the transaction continues in read-only state:
#
# 				ERROR 1792 (25006): Cannot execute statement in a READ ONLY transaction
#
# 			You can still make changes to session-specific temporary tables in a read-only transaction,
# 			or issue locking queries for them, because those changes and locks are not visible to
# 			any other transaction.
#
# 		) The autocommit setting is turned on, so that the transaction is guaranteeed to be a single statement,
# 			and the single statement making up the transaction is a "Non-locking" SELECT statement.
#
# 			That is, a SELECT that does not use a FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARED MODE clause.
#
# 		) The transaction is started without the READ ONLY option, but on updates or statements that explicitly
# 			locks have been executed yet.
#
# 			Until updats or explicit locks are required, a transaction stays in read-only mode.
#
# THus, for a read-intensive application such as a report generator,  you can tune a sequence of InnoDB
# queries by grouping them inside START_TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY and COMMIT, or by turning on the autocommit
# setting before running the SELECT statements, or simply by avoiding any data change statements interspersed
# with the queries.
#
# For information about START_TRANSACTION and autocommit, see later under START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, AND ROLLBACK SYNTAX
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Transactions that qualify as auto-commit, non-locking and read-only (AC-NL-RO) are kept out of certain internal
# 		InnoDB data structures and are therefore not listed in SHOW_ENGINE_INNODB_STATUS output.
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB REDO LOGGING
#
# Consider the following guidelines for optimizing redo logging:
#
# 		) Make your redo files big, even as big as the buffer pool.
#
# 			When InnoDB has written the redo log files full, it must write the modified contents of the buffer
# 			pool to disk in a checkpoint.
#
# 			Small redo log files cause many unecessary disk writes.
#
# 			Although historically big redo log files caused lengthy recovery times, recovery is now
# 			much faster and you can confidently use large redo log files.
#
# 			The size and number of redo log files are configured using the innodb_log_file_size and innodb_log_files_in_group
# 			 configuration options.
#
# 			For information about modifying an existing redo log file configuration, see CHANGING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF REDO LOG FILES.
#
# 		) Consider increasing the size of the log buffer.
#
# 			A large log buffer enables large transactions to run without a need to write the log to disk before the transactions
# 			commit.
#
# 			Thus, if you have transactions that update, insert, or delete many rows, making the log buffer large saves disk i/O.
#
# 			Log buffer size is configured using the innodb_log_buffer_size configuration option, which can be configured
# 			dynamically in 8.0
#
# 		) Configure the innodb_log_write_ahead_size configuration option to avoid "read-on-write".
#
# 			This option defines the write-ahead block size for the redo log.
#
# 			Set innodb_log_write_ahead_size to match the operating system or file system cache block size.
#
# 			Read-on-write occurs when redo log blocks are not entirely cached to the operating system
# 			or file system due to a mismatch between write-ahead block size for the redo log and operating system
# 			or file system cache block size.
# 
# 			Valid values for innodb_log_write_ahead_size are multiples of the InnoDB log file block size (2^n).
# 			The minimum value is the InnoDB log file block size (512)
#
# 			Write-ahead does not occur when the minimum value if specified.
#
# 			THe maxium value is equal to the innodb_page_size value.
#
# 			If you specify a value for innodb_log_write_ahead_size that is larger than the innodb_page_size
# 			value, the innodb_log_write_ahead_size setting is truncated to the innodb_page_size value.
#
# 			Setting the innodb_log_write_ahead_size value too low in relation to the operating system or file system
# 			cache block size results in read-on-write.
#
# 			Setting the value too high may have a slight impact on fsync performance for log file writes due to several
# 			blocks being written at once.
#
# 		) Optimize the use of spin delay by user threads waiting for flushed redo.
#
# 			Spin delay helps reduce latency. 
# 
# 			During periods of low concurrency, reducing latency may be less of a priority, and avoiding the use of spin delay during these periods may reduce
# 			energy consumption.
#
# 			During periods of high concurrency, you may want to avoid expending processing power on spin delay
# 			so that it can be used for other work.
#
# 			The following system variables permit setting high and low watermark values that define boundaries for the use of spin delay:
#
# 				) innodb_log_wait_for_flush_spin_hwm: Defines the maximum average log flush time beyond which user threads no longer spin while
# 						waiting for flushed redo.
#
# 					The default is 400 microseconds.
#
# 				) innodb_log_spin_cpu_abs_lwm: Defines the minimum amount of CPU usage below which user threads no longer spin while waiting
# 						for flushed redo.
#
# 						The value is expressed as a sum of CPU core usage.
#
# 						For example, the default value of 80 is 80% of a single CPU core.
#
# 						On a system with a multi-core processor, a value of 150 represents 100% usage of one cpu core plus50% usage of a second CPU core.
#
# 				) innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm: Defines the maximum amount of CPU usage above which user threads no longer spin while waiting for flushed redo.
#
# 						The value is expressed as a percentage of the combined total processing power of all CPU cores.
#
# 						The default value is 50%. For example, 100% usage of two cpu cores is 50% of the combined CPU processing power on a server with 4 CPU cores.
#
# 						The innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm configuration option respects processor affinity.
#
# 						For example, if a server has 48 cores but the mysqld process is pinned to only 4 CPU cores, the other 44 CPU cores are ignored.
#
# BULK DATA LOADING FOR INNODB TABLES
#
# These performance tips supplement the general guidelines for fast inserts in OPTIMIZING INSERT STATEMENTS.
#
# ) WHen importing data into InnoDB, turn off autocommit mode, because it performs a log flush to disk for every insert.
#
# 		To disable autocommit during your import operation, surround it with SET_autocommit and COMMIT statements:
#
# 			SET autocommit=0;
# 			___ SQL import statements ___
# 			COMMIT;
#
# 		The mysqldump option --opt creates dump files that are fast to import into an INnoDB table,
# 		even without wrapping them with the SET_autocommit and COMMIT statements.
#
# ) If you have UNIQUE constraints on secondary keys, you can speed up table imports by temporarily
# 		turning off the uniqueness checks during the import session:
#
# 			SET unique_checks=0;
# 			___ SQL import statements ___
# 			SET unique_checks=1;
#
# 		For big tables, this saves a lot of disk I/O because InnoDB can use its change buffer to write secondary
# 		index records in a batch.
#
# 		Be certain that hte data contains no duplicate keys.
#
# ) If you have FOREIGN KEY constraints in your tables, you can speed up table imports by turning off the foreign key
# 	checks for the duration of the import session:
#
# 		SET foreign_key_checks=0;
# 		___ SQL import statements ___
# 		SET foriegn_key_checks=1;
#
# 		For big tables, this can save a lot of disk I/O
#
# ) Using the multiple-row INSERT syntax to reduce communication overhead between the client and the server
# 		if you need to insert many rows:
#
# 		INSERT INTO yourtable VALUES (1,2), (5,5), ---;
#
# 		This tip is valid for inserts into any table, not just InnoDB tables.
#
# ) When doing bulk inserts into tables with auto-increment columns, set innodb_autoinc_lock_mode to 2
# 		(interleaved) instead of 1 (consecutive).
#
# 		see AUTO_INCREMENT HANDLING IN INNODB for details
#
# ) When performing bulk inserts, it is faster to insert rows in PRIMARY KEY order.
#
# 	 InnoDB tables use a clustered index, which makes it relativily fast to use data in the order of the PRIMARY KEY.
#
# 	 Performing bulk inserts in PRIMARY KEY order is particularly important for tables taht do not fit entirely
# 	 within the buffer pool.
#
# ) For optimal performance when loading data into an InnoDB FULLTEXT index, follow this set of steps:
#
# 		a. Define a column FTS_DOC_ID at table creation time, of type BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, with a unique
# 			index named FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 			CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 			FTS_DOC_ID BIGINT unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
# 			title varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
# 			text mediumtext NOT NULL,
# 			PRIMARY KEY (`FTS_DOC_ID`)
# 			) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
#
# 			CREATE UNIQUE INDEX FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX on t1(FTS_DOC_ID);
#
# 		b. Load the data into the tabe
#
# 		c. Create the FULLTEXT index after the data is loaded.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				When adding  FTS_DOC_ID column at table creation time, ensure that the FTS_DOC_ID column
# 				is updated when the FULLTEXT indexed column is updated, as the FTS_DOC_ID must increase
# 				monotonically with each INSERT or UPDATE.
#
# 				If you choose not to add the FTS_DOC_ID at table creation time and have InnoDB manage DOC IDs
# 				for you, InnoDB will add the FTS_DOC_ID as a hidden column with the next CREATE_FULLTEXT_INDEX call.
#
# 				This approach, however, requires a table rebuild which will impact performance.
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB QUERIES
#
# To turn queries for InnoDB tables, create an appropriate set of indexes on each table.
#
# See HOW MYSQL USES INDEXES for details.
#
# Follow these guidelines for InnoDB indexes:
#
# 		) Because each InnoDB table has a primary key (whether you request one or not), specify a set
# 			of primary key columns for each table, columns that are used in the most important and 
# 			time-critical queries.
#
# 		) Do not specify too many or too long columns in the primary key, because these column values are
# 			duplicated in each secondary index.
#
# 			When an index contains unnecessary data, the I/O to read this data and memory to cache it
# 			reduce the performance and scalability of the server.
#
# 		) Do not create a separate secondary index for each column, because each query can only make use of one index.
#
# 			Indexes on rarely tested columns or columns with only a few different values might not be 
# 			helpful for any queries. 
#
# 			If you have many queries for the same table, testing different combinations of columns, try to
# 			create a small number of concatenated indexes rather than a large number of single-column indexes.
#
# 			If an index contains all the columns needed for the result set (known as a covering index)
# 			, the query might be able to avoid reading the table data at all.
#
# 		) If an indexed column cannot contain any NULL values, declare it as NOT NULL when you create the table.
#
# 			The optimizer can better determine which index is most effective to use for a query, when it knows
# 			whether each column contains NULL values. 	
#
# 		) You can optimize single-query transactions for InnoDB tables, using the technique in OPTIMZING INNODB READ-ONLY TRANSACTIONS
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB DDL OPERATIONS
#
# ) Many DDL operations on tables and indexes (CREATE, ALTER and DROP statements) can be performed online.
#
# 		See INNODB AND ONLINE DDL for details.
#
# ) Online DDL support for adding secondary indexes means that you can generally speed up the process of creating
# 		and loading a table and associated indexes by creating the table without secondary indexes, then adding
# 		secondary indexes after the data is loaded.
#
# ) Use TRUNCATE_TABLE to empty a table, not DELETE FROM tbl_name.
#
# 		Foreign key constraints can make a TRUNCATE statement work like a regular DELETE statement,
# 		in which case a sequence of commands like DROP_TABLE and CREATE_TABLE might be fastest.
#
# ) Because the primary key is integral to the storage layout of each InnoDB table, and changing
# 		the definition of the primary key involves organizing the whole table,
# 		always set up the primary key as part of the CREATE_TABLE statement, and plan ahead so
# 		that you do not need to ALTER or DROP the primary key afterwards.
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB DISK I/O
#
# If you follow best practices for database design and tuning techniques for SQL operations,
# but your database is still slow due to heavy disk I/O activity, consider these disk I/O optimizations.
#
# If the Unix top tool or the Windows Task Manager show that the CPU usage percentage with your workload
# is < than 70%, your workload is probably disk-bound.
#
# ) Increase buffer pool size
#
# 		When table data is cached in teh InnoDB buffer pool, it can be accessed repeatedly by queries
# 		without requiring any disk I/O.
#
# 		Specify the size of the buffer pool with the innodb_buffer_pool_size option.
#
# 		This memory are is important enough that it is typically recommended that innodb_buffer_pool_size
# 		is configured to 50 to 75 % of the system memory.
#
# 		For more info, see HOW MYSQL USES MEMORY
#
# ) Adjust the flush method
#
# 		In some versions of GNU/Linux and UNIX, flushing files to disk with the Unix fsync() call
# 		(which InnoDB uses by default) and similar methods is surprisingly slow.
#
# 		If database write performance is an issue, conduct benchmarks with the innodb_flush_method 
# 		parameter set to O_DSYNC
#
# ) Configure a threshold size for the write buffer.
#
# 		By default, when InnoDB creates a new data file, such as a new log file or tablespace file,
# 		it flushes the contents of the write buffer to disk only after the file is fully written,
# 		which can cause a large amount of disk write activity to occur at once.
#
# 		To force smaller, periodic flushes, use innodb_fsync_threshold (introduced in MySQL 8.0.13)
# 		to define a threshold size for the write buffer, in bytes.
#
# 		The contents of the write buffer are flushed to disk when the threshold size is reached.
#
# 		The default value of 0 forces the default behavior.
#
# 		Specifying a write buffer threshold size to force smaller, periodic flushes may be beneficial
# 		in cases where multiple MySQL instances use the same storage devices.
#
# 		For example, creating a new MySQL instance and its associated data files could cause large surges
# 		of disk write activity, impeding the performance of other MySQL instances that use
# 		the same storage devices.
#
# 		Configuring a write buffer threshold size helps avoid such surges in disk write activity.
#
# ) Use a noop or deadline I/O scheduler with native AIO on Linux
#
# 		InnoDB uses the asynchronous I/O subsystem (native AIO) on Linux to perform read-ahead and
# 		write requests for data file pages.
#
# 		This behavior is controlled by the innodb_use_native_aio configuration option, which is enabled
# 		by default.
#
# 		With native AIO, the type of I/O scheduler has greater influence on I/O performance.
#
# 		Generally, noop and deadline I/O schedulers are recommended.
#
# 		Conduct benchmarks to determine which I/O scheduler provides the best results for your
# 		workload and environment. For more information, see later under USING ASYNCHRONOUS I/O ON LINUX
#
# ) Use direct I/O on Solaris 10 for x86_64 architechture
#
# 		When using the InnoDB storage engine on Solaris 10 for x86_64 architechture (AMD Opteron), use direct I/O
# 		for InnoDB-related files to avoid degradation of InnoDB performance.
#
# 		TO use direct I/O for an entire UFS file system used for storing InnoDB-related files, mount it with
# 		the forcedirectio option; see mount_ufs(1M)
#
# 		(The default on Solaris 10/x86_64 is NOT to use this option)
#
# 		To apply direct I/O only to InnoDB file operations rather than the whole file system,
# 		set innodb_flush_method_=O_DIRECT
#
# 		With this setting, InnoDB calls directio() instead of fcntl() for I/O to data files
# 		(not for I/O to log files)
#
# ) Use raw storage for data and log files with Solaris >= 2.6
#
# 		When using the InnoDB storage engine with a large innodb_buffer_pool_size value on any
# 		release of Solaris >= 2.6 and any platform (sparc/x86/x64/amd64), conduct benchmarks
# 		with InnoDB data files and log files on raw devices or on separate direct I/O UFS file systems,
# 		using the forcedirectio mount option described as prev.
#
# 		(it is necessary to use the mount option rather than setting innodb_flush_method if you want
# 		direct I/O for the log files)
#
# 		Users of the Veritas file system VxFS should use the convosync=direct mount option
#
# 		Do not place other MySQL data files, such as those for MyISAM tables, on a direct I/O file system.
#
# 		Executables or libraries MUST NOT be placed on a direct I/O file system.
#
# ) Use additional storage devices
#
# 		Additional storage devices could be used to set up a RAID configuration.
#
# 		For related information, see OPTIMIZING DISK I/O
#
# 		Alternatively, InnoDB tablespace data files and log files can be placed on  different
# 		physical disks.
# 			
# 		For more info, read under:
#
# 			 ) INNODB STARTUP CONFIGURATION
#
# 			) CREATING A TABLESPACE OUTSIDE OF THE DATA DIRECTORY
#
# 			) CREATING A GENERAL TABLESPACE
#
# 			) MOVING OR COPYING INNODB TABLES
#
# ) Consider non-rotational storage
#
# 		Non-rotational storage generally provides better performance for random I/O operations;
# 		and rotational storage for sequential I/O operations.
#
# 		When distributing data and log files across rotational and non-rotational storage devices,
# 		consider the type of I/O operations that are predominantly performed on each file.
#
# 		Random I/O-oriented files typically include file-per-table and general tablespace data files,
# 		undo tablespaces files and temporary tablespace files.
#
# 		Sequential I/O-oriented files include InnoDB system tablespace files (due to doublewrite buffering
# 		and change buffering) and log files such as binary log files and redo log files.
#
# 		Review settings for the following configuration options when using non-rotational storage:
#
# 			) innodb_checksum_algorithm
#
# 				The crc32 option uses a faster checksum algorithm and is recommended for fast storage systems.
#
# 			) innodb_flush_neighbors
#
# 				This option optimizes I/O for rotational storage devices. Disable it for non-rotational storage
# 				or a mix of rotational and non-rotational storage.
#
# 				It is disabled by default.
#
# 			) innodb_io_capacity
#
# 				The default setting of 200 is generally sufficient for lower-end non-rotational storage device.
#
# 				For higher-end, bus-attached devices, consider a higher setting such as 1000.
#
# 			) innodb_io_capacity_max
#
# 				the default value of 2000 is intended for workloads that use non-rotational storage.
#
# 				For a high-end, bus-attached non-rotational storage device, consider a higher setting
# 				such as 2500.
#
# 			) innodb_log_compressed_pages
#
# 				If redo logs are on non-rotational storage, consider disabling this option to reduce logging.
# 				See DISABLE LOGGING OF COMPRESSED PAGES.
#
# 			) innodb_log_file_size
#
# 				If redo logs are on non-rotational storage, configure this option to maximize caching and write combining.
#
# 			) innodb_page_size
#
# 				Consider using a page size that matches the internal sector size of the disk.
#
# 				Early-generation SSD devices often have a 4kb sector size.
#
# 				SOme newer devices have a 16kb sector size.
#
# 				The default InnoDB page size is 16kb. Keeping the page size close to the storage device
# 				block size minimizes the amount of unchanged data that is rewritten to disk.
#
# 			) binlog_row_image
#
# 				If binary logs are on non-rotational storage and all tables have primary keys, consider setting this
# 				option to minimal to reduce logging.
#
# Ensure that TRIM support is enabled for your OS. It is typically enabled by default.
#
# ) Increase I/O capacity to avoid backlogs
#
# 	If throughput drops periodically because of InnoDB checkpoints operations, consider increasing the value
# 	of the innodb_io_capacity configuration option:
#
# 	Higher values cause more frequent flushing, avoiding the backlog of work that can cause dips in throughput.
#
# ) Lower I/O capacity if flushing does not fall behind
#
# 	If the system is not falling behind with InnoDB flushing operations, consider lowering the value of
# 	the innodb_io_capacity configuration option:
#
# 	Typically, you keep this option value as low as practical, but not so low that it causes periodic
# 	drops in throughput as mentioned in the preceding point.
#
# 	In a typical scenario where you could lower the option value, you might see a combination like this
# 	in the output from SHOW_ENGINE_INNODB_STATUS:
#
# 		) History list length low, below a few thousand
#
# 		) Insert buffer merges close to rows inserted
#
# 		) Modified pages in buffer pool consistently well below innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct of the buffer pool.
#
# 			(Measure at a time when the server is not doing bulk inserts; it is normal during bulk inserts for the
# 			modified pages percentage to rise significantly.)
#
# 		) Log sequence number - last checkpoint is at less than 7/8 or ideally less than 6/8 of the total size of the InnoDB log files.
#
# ) Store system tablespace files on Fusion-io devices
#
# 	You can take advantage of a doublewrite buffer-related I/O optimization by storing system tablespace files
# ("ibdata files") on Fusion-io devices that support atomic writes.
#
# IN this case, doublewrite buffer (innodb_doublewrite) is automatically disabled and Fusion-io atomic writes are used
# for all data files.
#
# This feature is only supported on Fusion-io hardware and is only enabled for Fusion-io NVMFS on Linux.
# To take full advantage of this feature, an innodb_flush_method setting of O_DIRECT is recommended.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		BEcause the doublewrite buffer setting is global, doublewrite buffering is also disabled for data files residing
# 		on non-Fusion-io hardware.
#
# ) Disable logging for compressed pages
#
# 		WHen using the InnoDB table compression feature, images of re-compressed pages are written to the redo log
# 		when changes are made to compressed data.
#
# 		This behavior is controlled by innodb_log_compressed_pages, which is enabled by default to prevent corruption
# 		that can occur if a different version of the zlib compression algorithm is used during recovery.
#
# 		If you are certain that the zlib version will not change, disable innodb_log_compressed_pages to reduce redo log
# 		generation for workloads that modify compressed data.
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
#
# Different settings work best for servers with light, predictable loads, versus servers that are running
# near full capacity all the time, or that experience spikes of high activity.
#
# Because the InnoDB storage engine performs many of its optimizations automatically, many performance
# tuning tasks involve monitoring to ensure that the database is performing well, and changing configuration
# options when performance drops.
#
# See INNODB INTEGRATION WITH MYSQL PERFORMANCE SCHEMA for more info about detailed InnoDB performance monitoring.
#
# The main configuration steps you can perform include:
#
# 		) Controlling the type of data change operations for which InnoDB buffers the changed data,
# 			to avoid frequent small disk writes.
#
# 			See CONFIGURING CHANGE BUFFERING.
#
# 			Because the default is to buffer all types of data change operations, only change this setting
# 			if you need to reduce the amount of buffering.
#
# 		) Turning the adaptive hash indexing feature on and off using the innodb_adaptive_hash_index option.
# 			See ADAPTIVE HASH INDEX later, for more info.
# 			 
# 			You might change this setting during periods of unusual activity, then restore it to its original setting.
#
# 		) Setting a limit on the number of concurrent threads that InnoDB processes, if context switching is a bottleneck.
# 			See CONFIGURING THREAD CONCURRENCY FOR INNODB for more info
#
# 		) Controlling the amount of prefetching that InnoDB does with its read-ahead operations.
#
# 			WHen the system has unused I/O capacity, more read-ahead can improve the performance of queries.
# 			
# 			Too much read-ahead can cause periodic drops in performance on a heavily loaded system.
# 			See CONFIGURING INNODB BUFFER POOL PREFETCHING (READ-AHEAD) later, for more info.
#
# 		) Increasing the number of background threads for read or write operations, if you have a high-end
# 			I/O subsystem that is not fully utilized by the default values.
#
# 			See CONFIGURING THE NUMBER OF BACKGROUND INNODB I/O THREADS later for more.
#
# 		) Controlling how much I/O InnoDB performs in the background.
#
# 			See CONFIGURING THE INNODB MASTER THREAD I/O RATE, later, for more info:
#
# 			You might scale back this setting if you observe periodic drops in performance.
#
# 		) Controlling the algorithm that determines when InnoDB performs certain types of
# 			background writes. SEE CONFIGURING INNODB BUFFER POOL FLUSHING later, for more info.
#
# 			The algorithm works for some type of workloads but not others, so might turn off this setting if you
# 			observe periodic drops in performance.
#
# 		) Taking advantage of multicore processors and their cache memory configuration, to minimize delays
# 			in context switching. SEE CONFIGURING SPIN LOCK POLLING later, for more.
#
# 		) Preventing one-time operations such as table scans from interfering with the frequently accessed data
# 			stored in the InnoDB buffer cache. See MAKING THE BUFFER POOL SCAN RESISTANT later, for more info.
#
# 		) Adjusting log files to a size that makes sense for reliability and crash recovery.
#
# 			InnoDB log files have often been kept small to avoid long startup times after a crash.
# 			Optimizations introduced in MySQL 5.5 speed up certain steps of the crash recovery process.
#
# 			In particular, scanning the redo log and applying the redo log are faster due to improved
# 			algorithms for memory management.
#
# 			If you have kept your log files artificially small to avoid long startup times, you can now
# 			consider increasing log file size to reduce the I/O that occurs due to recycling of redo log records.
#
# 		) Configuring the size and number of instances for the InnoDB buffer pool, especially important for systems
# 			with multi-gigabyte buffer pools. see CONFIGURING MULTIPLE BUFFER POOL INSTACES for more info, later.
#
# 		) Increasing the maxium number of concurrent transactions, which dramatically improves scalability for the
# 			busiest databases. see UNDO LOGS later, for more info.
#
# 		) Moving purge operations (a type of garbage collection) into a background thread.
# 			See CONFIGURING INNODB PURGE SCHEDULING, later, for more info.
#
# 			To effectively measure the results of this setting, tune the other I/O-related and thread-related
# 			configuration settings first.
#
# 		) Reducing the amount of switching that InnoDB does between concurrent threads, so that SQL operations
# 			on a busy server do not queue up and form a "traffic jam".
#
# 			Set a value for the innodb_thread_concurrency option, up to a approximately 32 for a high-powered
# 			modern system.
#
# 			Increase the value for the innodb_concurrency_tickets option, typically to 5000 or so.
#
# 			This combination of options sets a cap on the number of threads that InnoDB process at any one time,
# 			and allows each thread to do substansial work before being swapped out, so that the number
# 			of waiting threads stays low and operations can complete without excessive context switching.
#
# OPTIMIZING INNODB FOR SYSTEMS WITH MANY TABLES
#
# ) If you have configured non-persistent optimizer statistics (a non-default configuration),
# 	InnoDB computes index cardinality values for a table the first time that table is accessed after
# 	startup, instead of storing such values in teh table.
#
# 	This step can take significant time on systems that partition the data into many tables.
#
# 	Since this overhead only applies to the initial table open operation, to "warm up" a table
#  for later use, access it immediately after startup by issuing a statement such as SELECT
# 	1 FROM tbl_name LIMIT 1.
#
# 	Optimizer statistics are persisted to disk by default, enabled by the innodb_stats_persistent
# 	configuration option.
#
# 	For information about persistent optimizer statistics, see CONFIGURING PERSISTENT OPTIMIZER STATISTICS PARAMETERS later on.
# 
# OPTIMIZING FOR MYISAM TABLES
#
# The MyISAM storage engine performs best with read-mostly data or with low-concurrency operations,
# because table locks limit the ability to perform simultaneous updates.
#
# In MYSQL, InnoDB is the default storage engine rather than MyISAM.
#
# OPTIMIZING MYISAM QUERIES
#
# Some general tips for speeding up queries on MyISAM tables:
#
# 		) To help MySQL better optimize queries, use ANALYZE_TABLE or run myisamchk --analyze on a table after it has been
# 			loaded with data.
#
# 			This updates a value for each index part that indicates the average number of rows that have the same value.
#
# 			(For unique indexes, this is always 1)
#
# 			MySQL uses this to decide which index to choose when you join two tables based on a nonconstant expression.
#
# 			You can check the result from the table analysis by using SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name and exmaining
# 			the Cardinality 
#
# 			myisamchk --description --verbose shows index distribution information.
#
# 		) To sort an index and data according to an index, use myisamchk --sort-index --sort-records=1
# 			(assuming that you want to sort on index 1)
#
# 			This is a good way to make queries faster if you have a unique index from which  you want to read all
# 			rows in order according to the index.
#
# 			The first time you sort a large table this way, it may take a long time.
#
# 		) Try to avoid complex SELECT queries on MyISAM tables that are updated frequently, to avoid problems
# 			with table locking that occur due to contention between readers and writers.
#
# 		) MyISAM supports concurrent inserts: If a table has no free blocks in the middle of the data file, you can INSERT
# 			new rows into it at the same time that other threads are reading from the table.
#
# 			If it is important to be able to do this, consider using the table in ways that avoid deleting rows.
#
# 			Another possibility is to run OPTIMIZE_TABLE to defragment the table after you have deleted
# 			a lot of rows from it.
#
# 			This behavior is altered by setting the concurrent_insert variable.
#
# 			You can force new rows to be appended (and therefore permit concurrent inserts), even in tables
# 			that have deleted rows. See CONCURRENT INSERTS for more.
#
# 		) For MyISAM tables that change frequently, try to avoid all variable-length columns (VARCHAR, BLOB and TEXT)
#
# 			The table uses dynamic row format if it includes even a single variable-length column.
#
# 			See ALTERNATIVE STORAGE ENGINES for more.
#
# 		) It is normally not useful to split a table into different tables just because the rows become large.
#
# 			In accessing a row, the biggest performance hit is the disk seek needed to find the first byte of the row.
# 			After finding the data, most modern disks can read the entire row fast enough for most applications.
#
# 			The only cases where splitting up a table makes an appreciable difference is if it is a MyISAM table
# 			using dynamic row format that you can change to a fixed row size, or if you very often need
# 			to scan the table but do not need most of the columns.
#
# 			See ALTERNATIVE STORAGE ENGINES, later.
#
# 		) Use ALTER TABLE --- ORDER BY expr1, expr2, --- if you usually retrieve rows in expr1, expr2, --- order.
#
# 			By using this option after extensive changes to the table, you may be able to get
# 			higher performance.
#
# 		) If you often need to calculate results such as counts based on information from a lot of rows,
# 			it may be preferable to introduce a new table and update the counter in real time.
#
# 			An update of the following form is very fast:
#
# 				UPDATE tbl_name SET count_col=count_col+1 WHERE key_col=constant;
#
# 			This is very important when you use MySQL storage engines such as MyISAM that has only table-level locking
# 			(multiple readers with single writers)
#
# 			This also gives better performance with most database systems, because the row locking manager in this case
# 			has less to do.
#
# 		) Use OPTIMIZE TABLE periodically to avoid fragmentation with dynamic-format MyISAM tables. See MYISAM TABLE STORAGE FORMATS for more info.
#
# 		) Declaring a MyISAM table with the DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1 table option makes index updates faster because they are not flushed
# 			to disk until the table is closed.
#
# 			The downside is that if something kills the server while such a table is open, you must ensure that the table is okay
# 			by running the server with the --myisam-recover-options option, or by running myisamchk before restarting the server.
#
# 			(However, even in this case, you should not lose anything by using DELAY_KEY_WRITE, because
# 			the key information can always be generated from teh data rows)
#
# 		) Strings are automatically prefix- and end-space compressed in MyISAM indexes. See CREATE INDEX SYNTAX for more.
#
# 		) You can increase performance by caching queries or answers in your application and then executing many
# 			inserts or updates together.
#
# 			Locking the table during this operation ensures that the index cache is only flushed once after all updates.
#
# BULK DATA LOADING FOR MYISAM TABLES
#
# These performance tips supplement the general guidelines for fast inserts in OPTIMIZING INSERT STATEMENTS discussed earlier
#
# ) For a MyISAM table, you can use concurrent inserts to add rows at the same time that SELECT statements are running,
# 		if there are no deleted rows in middle of the data file.
#
# 		see CONCURRENT INSERTS for more.
#
# ) With some extra work, it is possible to make LOAD_DATA_ΙΝFILE run even faster for a MyISAM table when the tables has 
# 		many indexes.
#
# 		Use the following procedure:
#
# 			a. Execute a FLUSH TABLES statement or a mysqladmin flush-tables command
#
# 			b. Use myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name to remove all use of indexes for the table.
#
# 			c. Insert data into the table with LOAD_DATA_INFILE. This does not update any indexes and therefore is very fast.
#
# 			d. If you intend only to read from the table in the future, use myisampack to compress it. See COMPRESSED TABLE CHARACTERISTICS for more.
#
# 			e. Re-create the indexes with myisamchk -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name
#
# 				This creates the index tree in memory before writing it to disk, which is much faster than
# 				updating the index during LOAD_DATA_INFILE because it avoids lots of disk seeks.
#
# 				The resulting index tree is also perfectly balanced.
#
# 			f. Execute a FLUSH_TABLES statement or a mysqladmin flush-tables command
#
# LOAD_DATA_INFILE performs the preceding optimization automatically if the MyISAM table into which
# you insert data is empty.
#
# The main difference between automatic optimization and using the procedure explicitly is that you can
# let myisamchk allocate much more temporary memory for the index creation than you might want the server to allocate
# for index re-creation when it executes the LOAD_DATA_INFILE statement.
#
# You can also disable or enable the nonunique indexes for a MyISAM table by using the following statements
# rather than myisamchk.
#
# If you use these statements, you can skip the FLUSH_TABLES operations:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISABLE KEYS;
# 		ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENABLE KEYS;
#
# ) To speed up INSERT operations that are performed with multiple statements for nontransactional tables,
# 	lock your tables:
#
# 		LOCK TABLES a WRITE;
# 		INSERT INTO a VALUES (1,23), (2,34), (4,33), ---;
# 		INSERT INTO a VALUES (8, 26), (6,29);
# 		---
# 		UNLOCK TABLES;
#
# THis benefits performance because the index buffer is flushed to disk only once, after all INSERT
# statements have completed.
#
# Normally, there would be as many index buffer flushes as there are INSERT statements.
# Explicit locking statements are not needed if you can insert all rows with a single INSERT.
#
# Locking also lowers the total time for multiple-connection tests, although the maximum wait time
# for individual connections might go up because they wait for locks.
#
# Suppose that five clients attempts to perform inserts simultaneously as follows:
#
# 		) Connection 1 does 1000 inserts
#
# 		) Connection 2,3 and 4 do 1 insert
#
# 		) Connection 5 does 1000 inserts
#
# If you do not use locking, connection 2,3 and 4 finishes before 1 and 5.
#
# If you use locking, connections 2,3, 4 probably do not finish before 1 or 5, but the total time
# should be about 40% faster
#
# INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations are very fast in MySQL, but you can obtain better overall
# performance by adding locks around everything that does more than about five successive inserts or updates.
#
# If you do very many successive inserts, you could do a LOCK_TABLES followed by an UNLOCK_TABLES once in
# while (each 1000 rows or so) to permit other threads to access table.
#
# This would still result in a nice performance gain.
#
# INSERT is still much slower for loading data than LOAD_DATA_INFILE, even when using the strategies just outlined.
#
# ) To increase performance for MyISAM tables, for both LOAD_DATA_INFILE and INSERT, enlarge the key cache
# 	by increasing the key_buffer_size system variable.
#
# For more info, see CONFIGURING THE SERVER.
#
# OPTIMIZING REPAIR TABLE STATEMENTS
#
# REPAIR_TABLE for MyISAM tables is similar to using myisamchk for repair operations, and some of the same performance optimizations apply.
#
# 		) myisamchk has variables that control memory allocation. You may be able to improve its performance by setting these variables.
# 			See MYISAMCHK MEMORY USAGE earlier.
#
# 		) For REPAIR_TABLE, the same principle applies, but because the repair is done by the server, you set server system variables
# 			instead of myisamchk variables.
#
# 			Also, in addition to setting memory-allocation variables, increasing the myisam_max_sort_file_Size system variable
# 			increases the likelihood that the repair will use the faster filesort method and avoid the slower repair by key cache method.
#
# 			Set the variable to the maximum file size for your system, after checking to be sure that htere is enough free space
# 			to hold a copy of the table files.
#
# 			The free space must be available in the file system containing the original table files.
#
# Suppose that a myisamchk table-repair operation is done using the following options to 
# set its memory-allocation variables:
#
# 		--key_buffer_size=128M --myisam_sort_buffer_size=256M
# 		--read_buffer_size=64M --write_buffer_size=64M
#
# Some of those myisamchk variables correspond to server system variables:
#
# 	myisamchk Variable 		System variable
#
# 	key_buffer_size 			key_buffer_size
# 	myisam_sort_buffer_Size myisam_sort_buffer_size 			
# 	read_buffer_size 			read_buffer_size
# 	write_buffer_size 		None
#
# Each of the server system variables can be set at runtime, and some of them (myisam_sort_buffer_Size, read_buffer_Size) have a 
# session value in addition to a global value.
#
# Setting a session value limits the effect of the change to your current session and does not affect other users.
#
# Changing a global-only variable (key_buffer_size, myisam_max_sort_file_size) affects other users as well.
#
# For key_buffer_size, you must take into account that the buffer is shared with those users.
#
# For example, if you set the myisamchk key_buffer_size variable to 128 mb, you could set the corresponding key_buffer_size
# system variable larger than that (if it is not already set larger), to permit key buffer use by activity in other sessions.
#
# However, changing the global key buffer size invalidates the buffer, causing increased disk I/O and slowdown for other
# sessions.
#
# An alternative that avoids this problem is to use a separate key cache, assign to it the indexes from the table to be repaired,
# and deallocate it when the repair is complete.
#
# See MULTIPLE KEY CACHES for more info.
#
# Based on the preceding remarks, a REPAIR_TABLE operation can be done as follows to use settings similar to the
# myisamchk command.
#
# Here a separate 128MB key buffer is allocated and the file system is assumed to permit a file size 
# of at least 100gb.
#
# SET SESSION myisam_sort_buffer_size = 256*1024*1024;
# SET SESSION read_buffer_size = 64*1024*1024;
#
# SET GLOBAL myisam_max_sort_file_size = 100*1024*1024*1024;
# SET GLOBAL repair_cache.key_buffer_size = 128*1024*1024;
#
# CACHE INDEX tbl_name IN repair_cache;
# LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE tbl_name;
# REPAIR TABLE tbl_name;
# SET GLOBAL repair_cache.key_buffer_size = 0;
#
# If you intend to change a global variable but want to do so only for the duration of a REPAIR_TABLE operation to minimally
# affect other users, save its value in a user variable and restore it afterwards.
#
# FOr example:
#
# SET @old_myisam_sort_buffer_size = @@GLOBAL.myisam_max_sort_file_size;
# SET GLOBAL myisam_max_sort_file_size = 100*1024*1024*1024;
# REPAIR TABLE tbl_name;
# SET GLOBAL myisam_max_sort_buffer_size = @old_myisam_max_sort_file_size;
#
# The system variables that affect REPAIR_TABLE can be set globally at server startup if you want the values to be in effect by default.
# 
# FOr example, add these lines to the server my.cnf file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		myisam_sort_buffer_size=256M
# 		key_buffer_size=1G
# 		myisam_max_sort_file_size=100G
#
# These settings do not include read_buffer.size
#
# Setting read_buffer_size globally to a large value does so for all sessions and can cause performance
# to suffer due to excessive memory allocation for a server with many simultaneous sessions.
#
# OPTIMIZING FOR MEMORY TABLES
#
# Consider using MEMORY tables for noncritical data that is accessed often, and is read-only or rarely updated.
#
# Benchmark your application against equivalent InnoDB or MyISAM tables under a realistic workload, to confirm
# that any additional performance is worth the risk of losing data, or the overhead of copying data from a 
# disk-based table at application start.
#
# For best performance with MEMORY tables, examine the kinds of queries against each table, and specify the type
# to use for each associated index, either a B-Tree index or a hash index.
#
# On the CREATE_INDEX statement, use the clause USING BTREE or USING HASH.
#
# B-tree indexes are fast for queries that do greater than or less than comparisons through
# operators such as > or BETWEEN.
#
# Hash indexes are only fast for queries that look up single values through the = operator, or a restricted
# set of values through the IN operator.
#
# FOr why USING BTREE is often a better choice than the default USING HASH, see AVOIDING FULL TABLE SCANS previously.
#
# For implementation details on different types of MEMORY indexes, see earlier, COMPARISON OF B-TREE AND HASH INDEXES
#
# UNDERSTANDING THE QUERY EXECUTION PLAN
#
# Depending On the details of your tables, columns, indexes and conditions in your WHERE clause,
# the MySQL optimizer considers many techniques to efficiently perform the lookups involved in an
# SQL query.
#
# A query on a huge table can be performed without reading all the rows;
#
# A join involving several tables can be performed without comparing every combination of rows.
#
# The set of operations that hte optimizer chooses to perform the most efficient query is called
# "the query execution plan", also known as the EXPLAIN plan.
#
# Your goal is to recognize the aspects of the EXPLAIN plan that indicate a query is optimized well,
# and to learn the SQL syntax and indexing techniques to improve the plan, if possible.
#
# OPTIMIZING QUERIES WITH EXPLAIN
#
# THe EXPLAIN statement provides information about how MySQL executes statements:
#
# 		) EXPLAIN works with SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE and UPDATE statements.
#
# 		) When EXPLAIN is used with an explainable statement, MySQL displays information from the optimizer about
# 			the statement execution plan.
#
# 			That is, MySQL explains how it would process the statement, including information about how tables
# 			are joined and in which order.
#
# 			For information about using EXPLAIN to obtain execution plan information, see EXPLAIN OUTPUT FORMAT
#
# 		) When EXPLAIN is used with FOR CONNECTION connection_id rather than an explainable statement, it displays
# 			the execution plan for the statement executing in teh named connection.
#
# 			See OBTAINING EXECUTION PLAN INFORMATION FOR A NAMED CONNECTION
#
# 		) For SELECT statements, EXPLAIN produces additional execution plan information that can be displayed
# 			using SHOW_WARNINGS.
#
# 			See EXTENDED EXPLAIN OUTPUT FORMAT for more info.
#
# 		) EXPLAIN is useful for examining queries involving partitioned tables.
#
# 			See OBTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT PARTITIONS for more info
#
# 		) The FORMAT options can be used to select the output format.
#
# 			TRADITIONAL presents the output in tabular format.
#
# 			This is the default if not FORMAT option is present.
#
# 			JSON Format displays the information in JSON format.
#
# With the help of EXPLAIN, you can see where you should add indexes to tables so that the statement executes
# faster by using indexes to find rows.
#
# YOu can also use EXPLAIN to check whether the optimizer joins the tables in an optimal order.
#
# To give a hint to the optimizer to use a join order corresponding to the order in which the
# tables are named in a SELECT statement, begin the statement with SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN rather than just select.
#
# See SELECT SYNTAX for more.
#
# However, STRAIGHT_JOIN may prevent indexes from being used because it disables semi-join transformations.
#
# See OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES, DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES and COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS WITH SEMI-JOIN TRANSFORMATIONS.
#
# The optimizer trace may sometimes provide information complementary to that of EXPLAIn.
#
# However, the optimizer trace format and content are subject to change betwen versions.
#
# For details, see MYSQL INTERNALS: TRACING THE OPTIMIZER
#
# If you ahve a problem with indexes not being used when you believe that they should be, run ANALYZE_TABLE
# to update table statistics, such as cardinality of keys, that can affect the choices the optimizer makes.
#
# See ANALYZE TABLE syntax for more.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		EXPLAIN can also be used to obtain information about the columns in a table.
#
# 		EXPLAIN tbl_name is synonymous with DESCRIBE tbl_name and SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbL_name.
#
# 		For more info, see DESCRIBE syntax and SHOW COLUMNS syntax
#
# EXPLAIN OUTPUT FORMAT
#
# THe explain statement provides information about how MySQL executes statements.
#
# EXPLAIN works with SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE and UPDATE statements.
#
# EXPLAIN returns a row of information for each table used in the SELECT statement.
#
# It lists the tbales in the output in teh order that MySQL would read them while
# processing the statement.
#
# MySQL resolves all joins using a nested-loop join method.
#
# THis means that MySQL reads a row from the first table, and then finds a matching row
# in the second table, teh third table, and so on.
#
# When all tables are processed, MySQL outputs the selected columns and backtracks through
# the table list until a table is found for which there are more matching rows.
#
# The next row is read from this table and the process continues with the next table.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		mySQL Workbench has a Visual Explain capability that provides a visual representation of EXPLAIN output.
# 		See TUTORIAL: USING EXPLAIN TO IMPROVE QUERY PERFORMANCE
#
# EXPLAIN OUTPUT COLUMNS
#
# This section describes the output columns produced by EXPLAIN.
# Later sections provide additional information about the type and Extra columns.
#
# Each output row from EXPLAIN provides information about one table.
#
# Each row contains the values summarized in EXPLAIN IN OUTPUT COLUMNS, and described in
# more detail in the following table.
#
# Column names are shown in teh table's first column; the second column provides the
# equivalent property name shown in the output when FORMAT=JSON is used.
#
# EXPLAIN OUTPUT COLUMNS
#
# Column 				JSON name 				Meaning
#
# id 						select_id 				The SELECT identifier
# select_type 			None 						The SELECT type
#
# table 					table_name 				The table for the output row
# partitions 			partitions 				The matching partitions
#
# type 					access_type 			The join type
# Possible_keys 		possible_keys 			The possible indexes to choose
#
# key 					key 						The index actually chosen
# key_len 				key_length 				The length of the chosen key
#
# ref 					ref 						The columns compared to the index
# rows 					rows 						Estimate of rows to be examined
#
# filtered 				Filtered 				Percentage of rows filtered by table condition
# Extra 					None 						Additional information
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The JSON properties which are NULL are not displayed in JSON-formatted EXPLAIN output.
#
# ) id(JSON name: select_id)
#
# 		THe SELECT modified.
#
# 		This is the sequential number of the SELECT within the query.
#
# 		The value can be NULL if the row refers to the union result of other rows.
#
# 		In this case, the table column shows a value like <union M,N> to indicate that the
# 		rows refers to the union of the rows with ID values of M and N.
#
# ) select_type (JSON name: None)
#
# 		The type of SELECT, which can be any of those shown in the following table.
#
# 		A JSON-formatted EXPLAIN exposes the SELECT type as a property of a query_block
# 		unless it is SIMPLE or PRIMARY.
#
# 		The JSON names (where applicable) are also shown in the table.
#
# 		select_type Value 				JSON name 					Meaning
#
# 		SIMPLE 								None 							Simple SELECT (not using UNION or subqueries)
#
# 		PRIMARY 								None 							Outermost SELECT
#
# 		UNION 								None 							Second or later SELECT statement in a UNION
#
# 		DEPENDENT UNION 					dependent (True) 			Second or later SELECT statement in a UNION, dependant on outer query
#
# 		UNION RESULT 						union_result 				Result of a UNION
#
# 		SUBQUERY 							None 							First SELECT in subquery
#
# 		DEPENDANT SUBQUERY 				dependent (True) 			First SELECT in subquery, dependant on outer query
#
# 		DERIVED 								None 								Derived table
#
# 		MATERIALIZED 						materialized_from_subquery Materialized subquery
#
# 		UNCACHABLE SUBQUERY 				cacheable(false) 			A subquery for which the result cannot be cached and must be re-evaluated for each row of the outer query
#
# 		UNCACHABLE UNION 					cacheable(false) 			The second or later select in a UNION that belongs to an uncachable subquery (see above)
#
# DEPENDENT typically signifies the use of a correlated subquery. See CORRELATED SUBQUERIES later, for more info.
#
# DEPENDENT SUBQUERY evaluation differs from UNCACHABLE SUBQUERY evaluation.
#
# For DEPENDENT SUBQUERY, the subquery is re-evaluated only once for each set of different values of the variables from its outer context.
# FOr UNCACHABLE SUBQUERY, the subquery is re-evaluated for each row of the otuer context.
#
# When you specify FORMAT=JSON with EXPLAIN, the output has no single property directly equivalent to
# select_type; the query_block property corresponds to a given SELECT.
#
# Properties equivalent to the most of the SELECT subquery types just shown are available (en example being Materialized_from_subquery
# for MATERIALIZED) and are displayed when appropriate.
#
# There are no JSON equivalents for SIMPLE or PRIMARY.
#
# The select_type value for non-SELECT statements display the statement type for affected tables.
#
# For example, select_type is DELETED for DELETE statements.
#
# ) table (JSON name: table_name)
#
# The name of the table to which the row of output refers. This can also be one of the following values:
#
#		 ) <unionM,N>: The row refers to the union of the rows with id values of M and N
#
# 		) <derivedN>: The row refers to the derived table result for the row with an id value of N.
# 					A derived table may result, for example, from a subquery in the FROM clause.
#
# 		) <subqueryN>: The row refers to the result of a materialized subquery for the row with an id value of N.
# 						See OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES WITH MATERIALIZATION
#
# ) partitions (JSON name:partitions)
#
# 		The partitions from which records would be matched by the query.
# 		The value is NULL for nonpartitioned tables. See OBTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT PARTITIONS for more.
#
# ) type (JSON name: access_type)
#
# 		The join type. For descriptions of the different types, see EXPLAIN Join Types.
#
# ) possible_keys (JSON name: possible_keys)
#
# 		The possible_keys column indicates the indexes from which MySQL can choose to find the rows in this table.
# 		Note that this column is totally independent of the order of the tables as displayed in the output from EXPLAIN.
#
# 		That means that some of the keys in possible_keys might not be usable in practice with the generated table order.
#
# 		If this column is NULL (or undefined in JSON-formatted output), there are no relevant indexes.
#
# 		In this case, you may be able to improve the performance of  your query by examining the WHERE clause
# 		to check whether it refers to some column or columns that would be suitable for indexing.
#
# 		If so, create an appropriate index and check the query with EXPLAIN again. See ALTER TABLE SYNTAX for more info.
#
# 		To see what indexes a table has, use SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name.
#
# ) key (JSON name: key)
#
# 		The key column indicates the key (index) that MySQL actually decided to use.
# 		If MySQL decided to use one of the possible_keys indexes to look up rows, that index is listed as the key value.
#
# 		It is possible that key will name an index that is not present in the possible_keys value.
#
# 		This can happen if none of the possible_keys indexes are suitable for looking up rows, but all the columns
# 		selected by the query are columns of some other index.
#
# 		That is, the named index covers the selected columns, so although it is not used to determine
# 		which rows to retrieve, an index scan is more efficient than a data row scan.
#
# 		For InnoDB, a secondary index might cover the selected columns even if the query also selects the
# 		primary key because InnoDB stores the primary key value with each secondary index.
#
# 		If key is NULL, MySQL found no index to use for executing the query more efficiently.
#
# 		To force mySQL to use or ignore an index listed in the possible_keys column, use FORCE INDEX,
# 		USE INDEX, or IGNORE INDEX in your query.
#
# 		See INDEX HINTS for more info.
#
# 		For MyISAM tables, running ANALYZE_TABLE helps the optimizer choose better indexes.
#
# 		For MyISAM tables, myisamchk --analyze does the same.
#
# 		See ANALYZE TABLE SYNTAX and MyISAM TABLE MAINTENANCE AND CRASH RECOVERY
#
# ) key_len (JSON name: key_length)
#
# 		The key_len column indicates the length of the key that MySQL decided to use.
#
# 		The value of key_len enables you to determine how many parts of a multiple-part key
# 		MySQL actually uses. If the key column says NULL, the len_len column also says NULL.
#
# 		Due to the key storage format, the key length is one greater for a column that can be
# 		NULL than for a NOT NULL column.
#
# ) ref (JSON name: ref)
#
# 		The ref column shows which columns or constants are compared to the index named in the key column 
# 		to select rows from the table.
#
# 		If the value is func, the value used is the result of some function.
#
# 		To see which function, use SHOW_WARNINGS following EXPLAIN to see the extended
# 		EXPLAIN output.
#
#  	The function might actually be an operator such as an arithmetic operator.
#
# ) rows (JSON name: rows)
#
#		The rows column indicates the number of rows MySQL believes it must examine to execute the query.
#
# 		For InnoDB tables, this number is an estimate, and may not always be exact.
#
# ) filtered (JSON name: filtered)
#
# 		The filtered column indicates an estimated percentage of table rows that will be filtered
# 		by the table condition.
#
# 		The maximum value is 100, which means no filtering of rows occurred.
#
# 		Values decreasing from 100 indicate increasing amounts of filtering.
#
# 		Rows shows the estimated number of rows examined and rows * filtered shows hte
# 		number of rows that will be joined with the following table.
#
# 		For example, if rows is 1000 and filtered is 50.00 (50%), the number of rows
# 		to be joined with the following table is 1000 x 50% = 500
#
# ) Extra (JSON name: none)
#
# 		This column contains additional information about how MySQL resolves the query.
#
# 		For descriptions of the different values, see EXPLAIN under EXTRA INFORMATION.
#
# 		There is no single JSON property corresponding to the Extra column; however, values
# 		that can occur in this column are exposed as JSON properties, or as the text of
# 		the message property.
#
# EXPLAIN JOIN TYPES
#
# The type column of EXPLAIN output describes how tables are joined.
#
# In JSON-formatted output, these are found as values of the access_type property.
#
# The following list describes the join types, ordered from the best type to the worst:
#
# 		) system
#
# 			The table has only one row (= system table). This is a special case of the const join type.
#
# 		) const
#
# 			The table has at most one matching row, which is read at the start of the query.
#
# 			Because there is only one row, values from the column in this row can be regarded as
# 			constants by the rest of the optimizer.
#
# 			const tables are very fast because they are read only once.
#
# 			const is used when you compare all parts of a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index to constant values.
#
# 			In the following queries, tbl_name can be used as a const table:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE primary_key=1;
#
# 				SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 					WHERE primary_key_part1=1 AND primary_key_part2=2;
#
# 		) eq_ref
#
# 			One row is read from this table for each combination of rows from the previous tables.
#
# 			Other than the system and const types, this is the best possible join type.
#
# 			It is used when all parts of an index are used by the join and the index is a PRIMARY
# 			KEY or UNIQUE NOT NULL index.
#
# 			eq_ref can be used for indexed columns that are compared using the = operator.
#
# 			The comparison value can be a constant or an expression that uses columns from tables
# 			that are read before this table.
#
# 			In the following examples, MySQL can use an eq_ref join to process ref_table:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
# 					WHERE ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;
#
# 				SELECT * FROM ref_table, other_table
# 					WHERE ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column
# 					AND ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
#
# 		) ref
#
# 			All rows with matching index values are read from this table for each combination of rows from
# 			the previous tables.
#
# 			ref is used if the join uses only a leftmost prefix of the key or if the key is not a PRIMARY KEY
# 			or UNIQUE index (in other words, if the join cannot select a single row based on the key value)
#
# 			If the key is used matches only a few rows, this is a good join type.
#
# 			ref can be used for indexed columns that are compared using the = or <=> operator.
# 			In the following examples, MySQL can use a ref join to process ref_table:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM ref_table WHERE key_column=expr;
#
# 				SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
# 					WHERE ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;
#
# 				SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
# 					WHERE ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column
# 					AND ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
#
# 		) fulltext
#
# 			The join is performed using a FULLTEXT index.
#
# 		) ref_or_null
#
# 			This join type is like ref, but with the addition that MySQL does an extra search for
# 			rows that contain NULL values.
#
# 			This join type optimization is used most often in resolving subqueries.
#
# 			In the following examples, MySQL can use a ref_or_null join to process ref_table:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM ref_table
# 					WHERE key_column=expr OR key_column IS NULL;
#
# 			See IS NULL OPTIMIZATION for more
#
# 		) index_merge
#
# 			This join type indicates that the Index Merge optimization is used. In this case, the key column
# 			in the output row contains a list of indexes used, and key_len contains a list of the
# 			longest key parts of the indexes used.
#
# 			For more information, See INDEX MERGE OPTIMIZATION for more info
#
# 		) unique_subquery
#
# 			This type replaces eq_ref for some IN subqueries of the following form:
#
# 				value IN (SELECT primary_key FROM single_table WHERE some_expr)
#
# 			unique_subquery is just an index lookup function that replaces the subquery completely for better efficiency.
#
# 		) index_subquery
#
# 			This join type is similar to unique_subquery.
# 			It replaces IN subqueries, but it works for nonunique indexes in subqueries of the following form:
#
# 				value IN (SELECT key_column FROM single_table WHERE some_expr)
#
# 		) range
#
# 			Only rows that are in a given range are retrieved, using an index to select the rows.
#
# 			The key column in the output row indicates which index is used.
#
# 			The key_len contains the longest key part that was used.
# 			The ref column is NULL for this type.
#
# 			range can be used when a key column is compared to a constant using any of the
# 			=, <>, >, <=, IS_NULL, <=>, BETWEEN, LIKE or IN() operators:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 					WHERE key_column = 10;
#
# 				SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 					WHERE key_column BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
#
# 				SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 					WHERE key_column IN (10,20,30);
#
# 				SELECT * FROM tbl_name
# 					WHERE key_part1 = 10 AND key_part2 IN (10, 20, 30);
#
# 		) index
#
# 			The index join type is the same as ALL, except that the index tree is scanned. This occurs two ways:
#
# 				) If the index is covering index for queries and can be used to satisfy all data required from the table,
# 					only the index tree is scanned.
#
# 					In this case, the Extra column says Using index.
#
# 					An index-only scan usually is faster than ALL because the size of the index usually is smaller than the table data.
#
# 				) A full table scan is performed used reads from the index to look up data rows in index order.
#
# 					Uses index does not appear in the Extra column.
#
# 			MySQL can use this join type when the query uses only columns that are part of a single index.
#
# 		) ALL
#
# 			A full table scan is done for each combination of rows from the previous tables.
#
# 			This is normally not good if the table is the first table not marked const, and usually
# 			very bad in other cases.
#
# 			Normally, you can avoid ALL by adding indexes that enable row retrieval from the table based
# 			on constant values or column values from earlier tables.
#
# EXPLAIN EXTRA INFORMATION
#
# The Extra column of EXPLAIN output contains additional information about how MySQL resolves the query.
#
# The following list explains the values that can appear in this column.
#
# Each item also indicates for JSON-formatted output which property displays the Extra value.
#
# For some of these, there is a specific property.
#
# The others display as the text of the message property.
#
# If you want to make your queries as fast as possible, look out for Extra column values of Using
# filesort and Using temporary, or, in JSON-formatted EXPLAIN output, for using_filesort and using_temporary_table
# properties equal to true.
#
# 		) Child of 'table' pushed join@1 (JSON: message text)
#
# 			This table is referenced as the child of table in a join that can be pushed down to the NDB kernel.
#
# 			applies only in NDB Cluster, when pushed-down joins are enabled.

# 			See the description of the ndb_join_pushdown server system variable for more info and examples.
#
# 		) const row not found (JSON property: const_row_not_found)
#
# 			For a query such as SELECT --- FROM tbl_name, the table was empty.
#
# 		) Deleting all rows (JSON property: message)
#
# 			For DELETE, some storage engines (such as MyISAM) support a handler method that removes all
# 			table rows in a simple and a fast way.
#
# 			This Extra value is displayed if the engine uses this optimization.
#
# 		) Distinct (JSON property: distinct)
#
# 			MySQL is looking for distinct values, so it stops searching for more rows for the current row combination
# 			after it has found the first matching row.
#
# 		) FirstMatch (tbl_name) (JSON property: first_match)
#
# 			The semi-join FirstMatch join shortcutting strategy is used for tbl_name.
#
# 		) Full scan on NULL key (JSON property: message)
#
# 			This occurs for subquery optimization as a fallback strategy when the optimizer cannot use an index-lookup access method.
#
# 		) Impossible HAVING (JSON property: message)
#
# 			The HAVING clause is always false and cannot select any rows.
#
# 		) Impossible WHERE (JSON property: message)
#
# 			The WHERE clause is always false and cannot select any rows.
#
# 		) Impossible WHERE noticed after reading const tables (JSON property: message)
#
#  		MySQL has read all const (and system) tables and notice that the WHERE clause is always false.
#
# 		) LooseScan(m--n) (JSON property: message)
#
# 			The semi-join LooseScan strategy is used, m and n are key part numbers.
#
# 		) No matching min/max row (JSON property: message)
#
# 			No row satisfies the condition for a query such as SELECT MIN(---) FROM --- WHERE condition.
#
# 		) No matching row in const table (JSON property: message)
#
# 			For a query with a join, there was an empty table or a table with no rows satisfying a unique index condition.
#
# 		) No matching rows after partition pruning (JSON property: message)
#
# 			For DELETE or UPDATE, the optimizer found nothing to delete or update after partition pruning.
# 			It is similar in meaning to Impossible WHERE for SELECT statements.
#
# 		) No tables used (JSON property: message)
#
# 			The query has no FROM clause, or has a FROM DUAL clause.
#
# 			For INSERT or REPLACE statements, EXPLAIN displays this value when there is no SELECT part.
#
# 			For example, it appears for EXPLAIN INSERTS INTO t VALUES(10) because that is equivalent to
# 			to EXPLAIN INSERT INTO t SELECT 10 FROM DUAL.
#
# 		) Not exists (JSON property: message)
#
# 			MySQL was able to do a LEFT JOIN optimization on the query and does not examine more rows in this table
# 			for the previous row combination after it finds one row that matches the LEFT JOIN criteria.
#
# 			Here is an example of the type of query that can be optimized this way:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id=t2.id
# 					WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
#
# 			Assume that t2.id is defined as NOT NULL. In this case, MySQL scans t1 and looks up the rows
# 			in t2 using the values of t1.id
#
# 			If MySQL finds a matching row in t2, it knows that t2.id can never be NULL, and does not scan
# 			through the rest of the rows in t2 that have teh same id value.
#
# 			In other words, for reach row in t1, MySQL needs to do only a single lookup in t2, regardless
# 			of how many rows actually match in t2.
#
# 		) Plan isn't ready yet (JSON property: none)
#
# 			This value occurs with EXPLAIN_FOR_CONNECTION when the optimizer has not finished creating the
# 			execution plan for the statement executing in the named connection.
#
# 			If execution plan output comprises multiple lines, any or all of them could have this Extra
# 			value, depending on the progress of teh optimizer in determining the full execution plan.
#
# 		) Range checked for each record (index map: N) (JSON property: message)
#
# 			MySQL found no good index to use, but found that some of indexes might be used
# 			after column values from preceding tables are known.
#
# 			For each row combination in the preceding tables, MySQL checks whether it is possible to
# 			use a range or index_merge access method to retrieve rows.
#
# 			This is not very fast, but is faster than performing a join with no index at all.
#
# 			The applicability criteria are as described in RANGE OPTIMIZATION and INDEX MERGE OPTIMIZATION
# 			with the exception that all column values for the preceding table are known and considered to be
# 			constants.
#
# 			Indexes are numbered beginning with 1, in the same order as shown by SHOW_INDEX for the table.
#
# 			The index map value N is a bitmask value that indicates which indexes are candidates.
#
# 			For example, a value of 0x19 (binary 11001) means that indexes 1,4, and 5 will be considered.
#
# 		) Recursive (JSON property: recursive)
#
# 			This indicates that the row applies to the recursive SELECT part of a recursive common table
# 			expression.
#
# 			See WITH SYNTAX (COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS) for more info
#
# 		) Scanned N databases (JSON property: message)
#
# 			This indicates how many directory scans the server performs when processing a query
# 			for INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables, as described in OPTIMIZING INFORMATION_SCHEMA QUERIES.
#
# 			The value can be 0,1 or ALL.
#
# 		) Select tables optimized away (JSON property: message)
#
# 			The optimizer determined 1) that at most one row should be returned, and 2) that to produce this row,
# 			a deterministic set of rows must be read.
#
# 			When the rows to be read can be read during the optimization phase (for example, by reading index rows),
# 			there is no need to read any tables during query execution.
#
# 			The first condition is fullfilled when the query is implicitly grouped (contains an aggregate function but
# 			no GROUP BY clause)
#
# 			The second condition is fullfilled when one row lookup is performed per index used.
#
# 			The number of indexes read determines the number of rows to read.
#
# 			Consider the following implicitly grouped query:
#
# 				SELECT MIN(c1), MIN(c2) FROM t1;
#
# 			Suppose that MIN(c1) can be retrieved by reading one index row and MIN(c2) can be retrieved
# 			by reading one row from a different index.
#
# 			That is, for each column c1 and c2, there exists an index where the column is the first
# 			column of the index.
#
# 			In this case, one row is returned, produced by reading two deterministic rows.
#
# 			This Extra value does not occur if the rows to read are not deterministic.
# 			Consider this query:
#
# 				SELECT MIN(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c1 <= 10;
#
# 			SUppose that (c1, c2) is a covering index.
# 			Using this index, all rows with c1 <= 10 must be scanned to find the minimum c2 value.
#
# 			By contrast, consider this query:
#
# 				SELECT MIN(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 10;
#
# 			In this case, the first index row with c1 = 10 contains the minimum c2 value.
#
# 			Only one row must be read to produce the returend row.
#
# 			For storage engines that maintain an exact row count per table (such as MyISAM, but not InnoDB),
# 			this Extra value can occur for COUNT(*) queries for which the WHERE clause is missing or always
# 			true and there is no GROUP BY clause.
#
# 			(This is an instance of an implicitly grouped query where the storage engine influences whether a
# 				determinsitc number of rows can be read)
#
# 		) Skip_open_table, Open_frm_only, Open_full_table (JSON property: message)
#
# 			These values indicate file-opening optimizations that apply to queries for INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.
#
# 				) Skip_open_table: Table files do not need to be opened. The information is already a vailable from the data dictionary.
#
# 				) Open_frm_only: Only the data dictionary need be read for table information.
#
# 				) Open_full_table: Unoptimized information lookup. Table information must be read from the data dictionary and by reading table files.
#
# 		) Start temporary, End temporary (JSON property: message)
#
# 			This indicates temporary table use for the semi-join Duplicate Weedout Strategy
#
# 		) unique row not found (JSON property: message)
#
# 			For a query such as SELECT_---_FROM tbl_name, no rows satisfy the condition for a UNIQUE index or PRIMARY KEY on the table.
#
# 		) Using filesort (JSON property: using_filesort)
#
# 			MySQL must do an extra pass to find out how to retrieve the rows in sorted order.
#
# 			The sort is done by going through all rows according to the join type and storing
# 			the sort key and pointer to the row for all rows that match the WHERE clause.
#
# 			The keys then are sorted and the rows are retrieved in sorted order.
#
# 			See ORDER BY OPTIMIZATION
#
# 		) Using index (JSON property: using_index)
#
# 			The column information is retrieved from the table using only information in the index
# 			tree without having to do an additional seek to read the actual row.
#
# 			This strategy can be used when the query uses only columns that are part of a single index.
#
# 			For InnoDB tables that have a user-defined clustered index, that index can be used even when
# 			Using index is absent from the Extra column.
#
# 			This is the case if type is index and key is PRIMARY.
#
# 		) Using index condition (JSON property: using_index_condition)
#
# 			Tables are read by accessing index tuples and testing them first to determine whether
# 			to read full table rows.
#
# 			In this way, index information is used to defer ("Push down") reading full table rows
# 			unless it is necessary.
#
# 			See INDEX CONDITION PUSHDOWN OPTIMIZATION
#
# 		) Using index for group-by (JSON property: using_index_for_group_by)
#
# 			Similar to the Using index table access method, Using index for group-by indicates
# 			that MySQL found an index that can be used to retrieve all columns of a GROUP BY or DISTINCT
# 			query without any extra disk access to the actual table.
#
# 			Additionally, the index is used in the most efficient way so that for each group,
# 			only a few index entries are. See GROUP BY OPTIMIZATION for more info.
#
# 		) Using index for skip scan (JSON property: using_index_for_skip_scan)
#
# 			Indicates that the Skip Scan access method is used. See SKIP SCAN RANGE ACCESS METHOD.
#
# 		) Using join buffer (Block Nested Loop), Using join buffer (Batched Key Access)
# 			(JSON property: using_join_buffer)
#
# 			Tables from earlier joins are read in portions into the join buffer, and then their rows
# 			are used from the buffer to perform the join with the current table.
#
# 			(Block Nested Loop) indicates use of the Block Nested-Loop algorithm and (Batched Key Access)
# 			indicates use of the Batched Key Access algorithm.
#
# 			That is, the keys from the table on the preceding line of the EXPLAIN ouput will be buffered,
# 			and the matching rows will be fetched in batches from the table represented by the line
# 			in which Using join buffer appears.
#
# 			In JSON-formatted output, the value of using_join_buffer is always either one of Block Nested
# 			Loop or Batched Key Access.
#
# 		) Using MRR (JSON property: message)
#
# 			Tables are read using the Multi-Range Read optimization strategy. See MULTI-RANGE READ OPTIMIZATION, for more info.
#
# 		) Using sort_union(---), Using union(---), Using intersect (---) (JSON property: message)
#
# 			These indicate the particular algorithm showing how index scans are merged for the index_merge join type.
#
# 			See INDEX MERGE OPTIMIZATION for more info.
#
# 		) Using temporary(JSON property: using_temporary_table)
#
# 			To resolve the query, MySQL needs to create a temporary table to hold the result.
#
# 			This typically happens if the query contains GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses that list
# 			columns differently.
#
# 		) Using where (JSON property: attached_condition)
#
# 			A WHERE clause is used to restrict which rows to match against the next table or send to the client.
#
# 			Unless you specifically intend to fetch or examine all rows from the table,
# 			you may have something wrong in your query if the Extra value is not Using where
# 			and the table join type is ALL or index.
#
# 			Using where has no direct counterpart in JSON-formatted output; teh attached_condition
# 			property contains any WHERE condition used.
#
# 		) Using where with pushed condition (JSON property: message)
#
# 			This item applies to NDB tables only.
#
# 			It means that NDB Cluster is using the Condition Pushdown optimization to improve
# 			the efficiency of a direct comparison between a nonindexed column and a constant.
#
# 			In such cases, the condition is "pushed down" to the cluster's data nodes and is evaluated
# 			on all data nodes simultaneously.
#
# 			This eliminates the need to send nonmatching rows over the network, and can speed up
# 			such queries by a factor of 5 to 10 times over cases where Condition Pushdown could be
# 			but is not used.
#
# 			For more info, see ENGINE CONDITION PUSHDOWN OPTIMIZATION.
#
# 		) Zero limit (JSON property: message)
#
# 			The query had a LIMIT 0 clause and cannot select any rows.
#
# EXPLAIN OUTPUT INTERPRETATION
#
# You can get a good indication of how good a join is by taking the product of the values in the rows
# column of the EXPLAIN output.
#
# This should tell you roughly how many rows MySQL must examine to execute the query.
#
# If you restrict queries with the max_join_size system variable, this row product also is used to
# determine which multiple-table SELECT statements to execute and which to abort.
#
# See earlier, in relation to Configuring the  Server.
#
# The following example shows how a multiple-table join can be optimized progressively based on the
# information provided by EXPLAIN.
#
# Suppose that you have the SELECT statement shown here and that you plan to examine it using EXPLAIN:
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT tt.TicketNumber, tt.TimeIn,
# 							tt.ProjectReference, tt.EstimatedShipDate,
# 							tt.ActualShipDate, tt.ClientID,
# 							tt.ServiceCodes, tt.RepetitiveID,
# 							tt.CurrentProcess, tt.CurrentDPPerson,
# 							tt.RecordVolume, tt.DPPrinted, et.COUNTRY,
# 							et_1.COUNTRY, do.CUSTNAME
# 					FROM tt, et, et AS et_1 do
# 					WHERE tt.SubmitTime IS NULL
# 						AND tt.ActualPC = et.EMPLOYID
# 						AND tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
# 						AND tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR;
#
# For this example, make the following assumptions:
#
# 		) The columns being compared have been declared as follows:
#
# 			Table 			Column 					Data Type
# 			tt 				ActualPC 				CHAR(10)
# 			tt 				AssignedPC 				CHAR(10)
# 			tt 				ClientID 				CHAR(10)
# 			et 				EMPLOYID 				CHAR(15)
# 			do 				CUSTNMBR 				CHAR(15)
#
# 		) The tables have the following indexes
#
# 			Table 			Index
# 			tt 				ActualPC
# 			tt 				AssignedPC
# 			tt 				ClientID
# 			et 				EMPLOYID (primary key)
# 			do 				CUSTNMBR (primary key)
#
# 		) The tt.ActualPC values are not evenly distributed.
#
# Initially, before any optimizations have been performed, the EXPLAIN statement produces the following information:
#
# 	table 	Type 		Possible_keys 		key 		key_len 		ref 		rows 		Extra
# 	et 		ALL 		PRIMARY 				NULL 		NULL 			NULL 		74
# 	do 		ALL 		PRIMARY 				NULL 		NULL 			NULL 		2135
# 	et_1 		ALL 		PRIMARY 				NULL 		NULL 			NULL 		74
#
#  tt 		ALL 		AssignedPC, 		NULL 		NULL 			NULL 		3872
# 							ClientID,
# 							ActualPC 			 				
# 				Range checked for each record (index map: 0x23)
#
# Because type is ALL for each table, this output indicates that MySQL is generating a Cartesian product
# of all the tables;
#
# That is, every combination of rows.
#
# This takes quite a long time, because the product of the number of rows in each table must be examined.
#
# For the case at hand, this product is 74 x 2135 x 73 x 3872 = about 45 mil rows.
#
# If the tables were bigger, you can only imagine the growth.
#
# One problem here is that MySQL can use indexes on columns more efficiently if they are
# declared as the same type and size.
#
# In this context, VARCHAR and CHAR are considered the same if they are declared as the same size.
#
# tt.ActualPC is declared as CHAR(10) and et.EMPLOYID is CHAR(15), so there is a length mismatch.
#
# To fix this disparity between column lengths, use ALTER_TABLE to lengthen ActualPC from 10 characters
# to 15 characters:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY ActualPC VARCHAR(15);
#
# Now tt.ActualPC and et.EMPLOYID are both VARCHAR(15).
#
# Executing the EXPLAIN statement again produces this result:
#
# 		table type 			possible_keys 	key 		key_len 		ref 		rows 		Extra
# 		tt 	ALL 			AssignedPC, 	NULL 		NULL 			NULL 		3872 		Using 
# 								ClientID, 															where
# 								ActualPC
# 		do 	ALL 			PRIMARY 			NULL 		NULL 			NULL 		2135
#				Range checked for each record (index map: 0x1)
# 		et_1 	ALL 			PRIMARY 			NULL 		NULL 			NULL 		74
# 				Range checked for each record (index map: 0x1)
# 		et 	eq_ref 		PRIMARY 			PRIMARY 	15  			tt.ActualPC 1
#
# This is not perfect, but better.
#
# The product of the rows values is less by a factor of 74. This version executes in a couple of seconds.
#
# A second alternation can be to eliminate the column length mismatches for the tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
# and tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR comparisons:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY AssignedPC VARCHAR(15),
# 							MODIFY ClientID  	VARCHAR(15);
#
# After that modification, EXPLAIN produces the output shown here:
#
# 		table type 			possible_keys 	key 		key_len 		ref 				rows 		Extra
# 		et 	ALL 			PRIMARY 			NULL 		NULL 			NULL 				74
# 		tt 	ref 			AssignedPC, 	ActualPC 15 			et.EMPLOYID 	52 		Using
# 								ClientID, 																	where
# 								ActualPC
# 		et_1 	eq_ref 		PRIMARY 			PRIMARY 	15 			tt.AssignedPC 	1
# 		do  	eq_ref 		PRIMARY 			PRIMARY  15 			tt.ClientID 	1
#
# At this point, the query is optimized almost as well as possible.
#
# The remaining problem, is that by default MySQL assumes that values in the tt.ActualPC column are evenly
# distributed.
#
# That is not the case for the tt.table.
#
# Fortunately, it is easy to tell MySQL to analyze the key distrib:
#
# 		ANALYZE TABLE tt;
#
# With the additional index information, the join is perfect and EXPLAIN produces this result:
#
# 		table type 			possible_keys 	key 		key_len 		ref 				rows 		Extra
# 		tt 	ALL 			AssignedPC 		NULL 		NULL 			NULL 				3872 		Using
# 								ClientID, 																	where
# 								ActualPC
# 		et 	eq_ref 		PRIMARY 			PRIMARY 	15 			tt.ActualPC  	1
# 		et_1 	eq_ref 		PRIMARY 			PRIMARY  15 			tt.AssignedPC 	1 
# 		do 	eq_ref 		PRIMARY 			PRIMARY 	15 			tt.ClientID 	1
#
# The rows column in the output from EXPLAIN is an educated guess from the MySQL join optimizer.
#
# Check whether the numbers are even close to the truth by comparing the rows products with
# the actual number of rows that the query runs.
#
# If then umbers are quite different, you might get better performance by using STRAIGHT_JOIN
# in your SELECT statement and trying to list the tables in a different order in the FROM clause.
#
# (However, STRAIGHT_JOIN may prevent indexes from being used because it disables semi-join transformations.
# See OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES, DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES, AND COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIOSN WITH SEMI-JOIN TRANSFORMATIONS
#
# IT is possible in some cases to execute statements that modify data when EXPLAIN_SELECT is used
# with a subquery.

# For more info about this, see DERIVED TABLES, later.
#
# EXTENDED EXPLAIN OUTPUT FORMAT
#
# The EXPLAIN statement produces extra ("extended") information that is not part of EXPLAIN
# output but can be viewed by issuing a SHOW WARNINGS statement following EXPLAIN.
#
# As of MySQL 8.0.12, extended information is available for SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE and UPDATE statements.
#
# Prior to 8.0.12, extended info is only available for SELECT statements.
#
# The Message value in show_warnings output displays how the optimizer qualifies table and column
# names in the SELECT statement, what hte SELECT looks like after the application of rewriting
# and optimization rules, and possibly other notes about the optimizaiton process.
#
# The extended information displayable with a SHOW_WARNINGS statement following EXPLAIN is produced only
# for SELECT statements.
#
# SHOW_WARNINGS displays an empty result for other explainable statements. (DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE and UPDATE)
#
# Here is an example of extended EXPLAIN output:
#
# 		EXPLAIN SELECT t1.a, t1.a IN (SELECT t2.a FROM t2) FROM t1\G
# 		******************** 1. row *********************

#
# Because the statement displayed by SHOW_WARNINGS may contain special markers to provide info
# about query rewriting or optimizer actions, the statement is not necessarily valid SQL
# and is not intended to be executed.
#
# The output may also include rows with Message values that provide additional non-SQL explanatory
# notes about actions taken by the optimizer.
#
# The following list describes special markers that can appear in the extended output displayed
# by SHOW_WARNINGS:
#
# 		) <auto_key>
#
# 			An automatically generated key for a temporary table
#
# 		) <cache>(expr)
#
# 			The expression (such as scalar subquery) is executed once and the resulting value is saved
# 			in memory for later use.
#
# 			For results consisting of multiple values, a temporary table may be created and you will
# 			see <temporary table> instead.
#
# 		) <exists>(query fragment)
#
# 			THe subquery predicate is converted to an EXISTS predicate and the subquery is transformed
# 			so that it can be used together with the EXISTS predicate.
#
# 		) <in_optimizer>(query fragment)
#
# 			This is an internal optimizer object with no user significance
#
# 		) <index_lookup> (query fragment)
#
# 			The query fragment is processed using an index lookup to find qualifying rows
#
# 		) <if>(condition, expr1, expr2)
#
# 			If the condition is true, evaluate to expr1, otherwise expr2
#
# 		) <is_not_null_test>(expr)
#
# 			A test to verify that the expression does not evaluate to NULL
#
# 		) <materialize>(query fragment)
#
# 			Subquery materialization is used.
#
# 		) `materialized-subquery`.col_name
#
# 			A reference to the column col_name in an internal temporary table materialized to hold the result from evaluating a subquery.
#
# 		) <primary_index_lookup>(query fragment)
#
# 			The query fragment is processed using a primary key lookup to find qualifying rows
#
# 		) <ref_null_helper>(expr)
# 
# 			This is an internal otpimizer object with no user significance
#
# 		) /* SELECT#N */ select_stmt
#
# 			The SELECT is associated with the row in non-extended EXPLAIN output that has an id value of N.
#
# 		) outer_tables semi join (inner_tables)
#
# 			A semi-join operation.
#
# 			inner_tables shows the tables that were not pulled out. 
#
# 			See OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES, DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES AND COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS WITH SEMI-JOIN TRANSFORMATIONS.
#
# 		) <temporary table>
#
# 			This represents an internal temporary table created to cache an intermediate result.
#
# When some tables are of const or system type, expressions involving columns from these tables
# are evaluated early by the optimizer and are not part of the displayed statement.
#
# However, with FORMAT=JSON, some const table accesses are displayed as ref access
# that uses a const value.
#
# OBTAINING EXECUTION PLAN INFORMATION FOR A NAMED CONNECTION
#
# To obtain the execution plan for an explainable statement executing in a named connection,
# use this statement:
#
# 		EXPLAIN [options] FOR CONNECTION connection_id;
#
# EXPLAIN_FOR_CONNECTION returns the EXPLAIN information that is currently being used to
# execute a query in a given connection.
#
# Because of changes to data (and supporting statistics) it may produce a different result from
# running EXPLAIN on the equivalent query text.
#
# This difference in behavior can be useful in diagnosing more transient performance problems.
#
# FOr example, if you are running a statement in one session that is taking a long time to complete,
# using EXPLAIN_FOR_CONNECTION in another session may yield useful information about the cause of the delay.
#
# connection_id is the connection identifier, as obtained from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST table or
# the SHOW_PROCESSLIST statement.
#
# If you have the PROCESS privilege, you can specify the identifier for any connection.
#
# Otherwise, you can specify the identifier only for your own connections.
#
# If the named connection is not executing a statement, the result is empty.
#
# Otherwise, EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION applies only if the statement being executed in teh
# named connection is explainable.
#
# THis includes SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE and UPDATE.
#
# (However, EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION does not work for prepared statements, even prepared
# statements of those types.)
#
# If the named connection is executing an explainable statement, the output is what  you would
# obtain by using EXPLAIN on the statement itself.
#
# If the named connection is executing a statement that is not explainable, an error occurs.
#
# For example, you cannot name the connection identifier for your current session because EXPLAIN
# is not explainable:
#
# SELECT CONNECTION_ID();
# +----------------------------+
# | CONNECTION_ID() 				 |
# +----------------------------+
# | 					373 		    |
# +----------------------------+
# 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#
# EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION 373;
# ERROR 1889 (HY000): EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION command is not supported
# only for SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE/REPLACE
#
# The Com_explain_other status variable indicates the number of EXPLAIN_FOR_CONNECTION
# statements executed.
#
# ESTIMATING QUERY PERFORMANCE
#
# In most cases, you can estimate query performance by counting disk seeks.
#
# For small tables, you can usually find a row in one disk seek (because the index is probably
# cached)
#
# For bigger tables, you can estimate that, using B-TREE indexes, you need this many seeks to find
# a row:
#
# log(row_count) / log(index_block_length / 3 * 2 / (index_length + data_pointer_length)) + 1
#
# In MYSQL an index block is usually 1024 bytes and the data pointer is usually four bytes.
#
# For a 500,000-row table with a key value length of three bytes (the size of MEDIUMINT),
# the formula indicates:
#
# 		log(500,000)/log(1024/3*2/(3+4)) + 1 = 4 seeks
#
# This index would require storage of about 500,000 * 7 * 3/2=5.2MB, assuming a
# typical index buffer fill ratio of 2/3), so you probably have much of the index
# in memory and so need only one or two calls to read data to find the row.
#
# For writes, however, you need four seek requests to find where to place a new index value and
# normally two seeks to update the index and write the row.
#
# The preceding discussion does not mean that your application pperformance slowly degenerated
# by LOG N.
#
# As long as everything is cached by the OS or the MySQL server, things become only marginally
# slower as the tables get bigger.
#
# After the data gets too big to be cached, things start to go much slower until your applications
# are bound only by disk seeks
#
# (which increases by LOG N)
#
# To avoid this, increase the key cache size as the data grows.
#
# For MyISAM tables, the key cache is controlled by the key_buffer_size system variable.
#
# CONTROLLING THE QUERY OPTIMIZER
#
# MySQL provides optimizer control through system variables that affect how query plans are evaluated,
# switchable optimizations, optimizer and index hints, and the optimizer cost model.
#
# The server also maintains statistics about column values, although the optimizer does not
# yet use this information.
#
# CTRONLLING QUERY PLAN EVOLUTION
#
# The task of the query optimizer is to find an optimal plan for executing an SQL query.
#
# Because the difference in performance between "good" and "bad" plans can be orders of
# magnitudes (that is, seconds vs hours or even days), most query optimizers, include that of MySQL,
# perform a more or less exhaustive search for na optimal plan amongst all possible query evaluation plans.
#
# For join queries, the number of possible plans investigated by the MySQL optimizer grows exponentionally
# with the number of tables referenced in a query.
#
# For small number of tables (typically less than 7 to 10) this is not a problem.
#
# However, when large queries are submitted, the time spent in query optimization may easily
# become the major bottleneck in the server's performance.
#
# a more flexible method for query optimization enabvles the user to control how exhaustive
# the optimizer is in its search for an optimal query evaluation plan.
#
# The general idea is that the fewer plans that are investigated by the optimizer, the less time
# it spends in compiling a query.
#
# On the other hand, because the optimizer skips some plans, it may miss finding an optimal plan.
#
# The behavior of the optimizer with respect to the number of plans it evaluates can be controlled
# using two system variables:
#
# 		) The optimizer_prune_level variable tells the optimizer to skip certain plans based on
# 			estimates of the number of rows accessed for each table.
#
# 			Our experience shows that this kind of "educated guess" rarely misses optimal plans, and
# 			may dramatically reduce query compilation times.
#
# 			That is why this option is on (optimizer_prune_level=1) by default.
#
# 			However, if oyu believe that hte optimizer missed a better query plan, this option can be
# 			switched off (optimizer_prune_level=0) with the risk that query compilation
# 			may take much longer.
#
# 			Note that, even with the use of this heuristic, the optimizer still explores a
# 			roughly exponentional number of plans.
#
# 		) The optimizer_search_depth variable tells how far into the "future" of each incomplete
# 			plan the optimizer should look to evaluate whether it should be expanded further.
#
# 			Smaller values of optimizer_search_depth may result in orders of magnitudes smaller query
# 			compilation times.
#
# 			For example, queries with 12, 13 or more tables may easily require hours or even days
# 			to compile, if optimizer_search_depth is close to the number of tables in teh query.
#
# 			At the same time, if compiled with optimizer_saerch_depth equal to 3 or 4, the optimizer
# 			may compile in less than a minute for the same query.
#
# 			If you are unsure of what a reasonable value is for optimizer_search_depth,
# 			this variable can be set to 0 to tell the optimizer to determine the value automatically.
#
# OPTIMIZER HINTS
#
# 		One means of control over optimizer strategies is to set the optimizer_Switch system variable 
# 		(See SWITCHABLE OPTIMIZATIONS).
#
# 		Changes to this variable affect execution of all subsequent queries; to affect one query differently
# 		from another, it is necessary to change optimizer_switch before each one.
#
# 		Another way to control the optimizeri s by using optimizer hints, which can be specified within
# 		individual statements.
#
# 		BEcause optijmizer hints apoply on a per-statement basis,s they provide finer control over
# 		statement execution plans than can be achieved using optimizer_switch.
#
# 		For example, you can enable an optimization for one table in a statement and disable the
# 		optimization for a different table.
#
# 		Hints within a statement take precedence over optimizer_switch flags.
#
# 		Examples:
#
# 			SELECT /*+ NO_RANGE_OPTIMIZATION(t3 PRIMARY, f2_idx) */ f1
# 				FROM t3 WHERE f1 > 30 and f1 < 33;
# 			SELECT /*+ BKA(t1) NO_BKA(t2) */ * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 WHERE ---;
#
# 			SELECT /*+ NO_ICP(t1, t2) */ * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 WHERE ---;
# 			SELECT /*+ SEMIJOIN(FIRSTMATCH, LOOSESCAN) */ * FROM t1 ---;
#
# 			EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ NO_ICP(t1) */ * FROM t1 WHERE ---;
# 			SELECT /*+ MERGE(dt) */ * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) AS dt;
# 		
# 			INSERT /*+ SET_VAR(foreign_key_checks=OFF) */ INTO t2 VALUES(2);
#
# Optimizer hints described here, differ from index hints described in INDEX HINTS.
#
# Optimizer and index hints may be used separately or together.
#
# OPTIMIZER HINT OVERVIEW
#
# Optimizer hints apply at different scope levels:
#
# 		) Global: The hint affects the entire statement
#
# 		) Query block: The hint affects a particular query block within a statement
#
# 		) table-level: The hint affects a particular table within a query block
#
# 		) Index-level: The hint affects a particular index within a table
#
# The following table summarizes teh available optimizer hints, the optimizer strategies they affect,

#
# OPTIMIZER HINT SYNTAX
#
# MySQL supports comments in SQL statements as described in COMMENT SYNTAX later.
#
# Optimizer hints must be specified within /*+ --- */ comments
#
# That is, optimnizer hints use a variant of /* --- */ C-style comment syntax, with a + char
# following the /* comment opening sequence. Examples:
#
# /*+ BKA(t1) */
# /*+ BNL(t1, t2) */
# /*+ NO_RANGE_OPTIMIZATION(t4 PRIMARY) */
# /*+ QB_NAME(qb2) */
#
# Whitespace is permitted after the + character.
#
# The parser recognizes optimizer hints comments after the intial keyword of SELECt, UPDATE,
# INSERT, REPLACE and DELETE statements.
#
# Hints are permitted in thse contexts:
#
# 		) The beginning of query and data change statements:
#
# 			SELECT /*+ --- */ ---
# 			INSERT /*+ --- */ ---
# 			REPLACE /+ --- */ ---
# 			UPDATE /*+ --- */ ---
# 			DELETE /*+ --- */ ---
#
# 		) At the beginning of query blocks
#
# 			(SELECT /*+ --- */ --- )
# 			(SELECT --- ) UNION (SELECT /*+ --- */ --- )
# 			(SELECT /*+ --- */ --- ) UNION (SELECT /*+ --- */ --- )
#
# 			UPDATE --- WHERE x IN (SELECT /*+ --- */ ---)
# 			INSERT --- SELECT /*+ --- */ ---
#
# 		) In hintable statements prefaced by EXPLAIN. For example:
#
# 			EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ --- */ ---
# 			EXPLAIN UPDATE --- WHERE x in (SELECT /*+ --- */ ---)
#
# 			The impliation is that you can use EXPLAIN to see how optimizer hints affect execution plans.
# 			Use SHOW_WARNINGS immediately after EXPLAIN to see how hints are used.
#
# 			The extended EXPLAIN output displayed by a following SHOW_WARNINGS indicates which
# 			hints were used.
#
# 			Ignored hints are not displayed.
#
# A hint comment may contain multiple hints, but a query block cannot contain multiple hint comments.
# This is valid:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ BNL(t1) BKA(t2) */ ---
#
# But this is invalid:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ BNL(t1) */ /* BKA(t2) */ ---
#
# When a hint comment contains multiple hints, the possibility of duplicates and conflicts exists.
#
# The following general guidelines apply.
#
# For specific hint types, additional rules may apply, as indicated in teh hint descriptions.
#
# 		) Duplicate hints: For a hint such as /*+ MRR(idx1) MRR(idx1) */, MySQL uses the first hint and issues a warning about the duplicate hint
#
# 		) Conflicting hints: FOr a hint such as /*+ MRR(idx1) NO_MRR(idx1) */, MysQL uses the first hint and issues a warning about the second conflicting hint
#
# Query block names are identifiers and follow the usual rules about what names are valid and how to quote them.
# (See SCHEMA OBJECT NAMES for more info)
#
# Hint names, query block names and strategy names are not case sensitive.
#
# References to table and index names follow the usual identifier case sensitivity rules
# (see IDENTIFIER CASE SENSITIVITY)
#
# JOIN-ORDER OPTIMIZER HINTS
#
# Joint-order hints affect the order in which the optimizer joins tables.
#
# Syntax of the JOIN_FIXED_ORDER hint:
#
# 		hint_name([@query_block_name])
#
# Syntax of other join-order hints:
#
# 		hint_name([@query_block_name] tbl_name [, tbl_name] ---)
# 		hint_name(tbl_name[@query_block_name] [, tbl_name[@query_block_name]] ---)
#
# The syntax refers to these terms:
#
# 		) hint_name: These hint names are permitted:
#
# 			) JOIN_FIXED_ORDER: Force the optimizer to join tables using the order in which they appear in the FROM clause.
# 										This is the same as specifying SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN.
#
# 			) JOIN_ORDER: Instruct the optimizer to join tables using the specified table order.
#
# 								The hint applies to the named tables.
#
# 								The optimizer may place tables that are not named anywhere in the join order, including between specified tables.
#
# 			) JOIN_PREFIX: Instruct the optimizer to join tables using the specified table order for the first tables of the join execution plan.
# 		
# 								The hint applies to the named tables.
#
# 								The optimizer places all other tables after the named tables.
#
# 			) JOIN_SUFFIX: Instruct the optimizer to join tables using the specified table order for the last tables of the join execution plan.
# 								
# 								The hint applies to the named tables.
#
# 								The optimizer places all other tables before the named tables.
#
# 		) tbl_name: The name of a table used in the statement.
#
# 						A hint that names tables applies to all tables that it names.
#
# 						The JOIN_FIXED_ORDER hint names no tables and applies to all tables in the FROM
# 						clause of the query block in which it occurs.
#
# 						If a table has an alias, hints must refer to the alias, not the table name.
#
# 						Table names in hints cannot be qualified with schema names.
#
# 		) query_block_name:
#
# 						The query block to which the hint applies.
#
# 						If the hint includes no leading @query_block_name, the hint applies to 
# 						the query block in which it occurs.
#
# 						For tbl_name@query_block_name syntax, the hint applies to the named table
# 						in the named query block.
#
# 						To assign a name to a query block, see OPTIMIZER HINTS FOR NAMING QUERY BLOCKS
#
# Example:
#
# 		SELECT
# 		/*+ JOIN_PREFIX(t2, t5@subq2, t4@subq1)
# 			 JOIN_ORDER(t4@subq1, t3)
# 			 JOIN_SUFFIX(t1)  */
# 		COUNT(*) FROM t1 JOIN t2 JOIN t3
# 					  WHERE t1.f1 IN (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(subq1) */ f1 FROM t4)
# 						AND t2.f1  IN (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(subq2) */ f1 FROM t5);
#
# Hints control the behavior of semi-join tables that are merged to the outer query block.
#
# If subqueries subq1 and subq2 are converted to semi-joins, tables t4@subq1 and t5@subq2 are merged
# to the outer query block.
#
# In this case, the hint specified in the outer query block controls the behavior of t4@subq1, t5@subq2 tables.
#
# The optimizer resolves join-order hints according to these principles:
#
# 		) Multiple hint instances
#
# 			Only one JOIN_PREFIX and JOIN_SUFFIX hint of each type are applied.
#
# 			ANy later hints of the same type are ignored with a warning.
#
# 			JOIN_ORDER can be specified several times.
#
# 			Examples:
#
# 				/*+ JOIN_PREFIX(t1) JOIN_PREFIX(t2) */
#
# 			The second JOIN_PREFIX hint is ignored with a warning.
#
# 				/*+ JOIN_PREFIX(t1) JOIN_SUFFIX(t2) */
#
# 			Both hints are applicable. No warning occurs.
#
# 				/* JOIN_ORDER(t1, t2) JOIN_ORDER(t2, t3) */
#
# 			Both hints are applicable. No warning occurs.
#
# 		) Conflicting hints
#
# 			In some cases hints can conflict, such as when JOIN_ORDER and JOIN_PREFIX have table
# 			orders that are impossible to apply at the same time:
#
# 				SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER(t1, t2) JOIN_PREFIX(t2, t1) */ --- FROM t1, t2;
#
# 			In this case, the first specified hint is applied and subsequent conflicting hints
# 			are ignored with no warning.
#
# 			A valid hint that is impossible to apply is silently ignored with no warning.
#
# 		) Ignored hints
#
# 			A hint is ignored if a table specified in the hint has circular dependency
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				/*+ JOIN_ORDER(t1, t2) JOIN_PREFIX(t2, t1) */
#
# 			The JOIN_ORDER hint sets table t2 dependent on t1.
#
# 			The JOIN_PREFIX hint is ignored because table t1 cannot be dependant on t2.
#
# 			Ignored hints are not displayed in extended EXPLAIN output.
#
# 		) Interaction with  const tables
#
# 			The MySQL optimizer places const tables first in the join order, and the position of
# 			a const table cannot be affected by hints.
#
# 			References to const tables in join-order hints are ignored, although the hint
# 			is still applicable.
#
# 			For example, these are equivalent:
#
# 				JOIN_ORDER(t1, const_tbl, t2)
# 				JOIN_ORDER(t1, t2)
#
# 			Accepted hints shown in extended EXPLAIN output include const tables as they were specified.
#
# 		) Interaction with types of join operations
#
# 			MySQL supports several type of joins:
#
# 				LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, CROSS, STRAIGHT_JOIN.
#
# 			A hint that conflicts with the specified type of join is ignored with no warning.
#
# 			Example:
#
# 				SELECT /*+ JOIN_PREFIX(t1, t2) */FROM t2 LEFT JOIN t1;
#
# 			Here a conflict occurs between the requested join order in the hint and the order
# 			required by the LEFT JOIN.
#
# 			The hint is ignored with no warning.
#
# TABLE-LEVEL OPTIMIZER HINTS
#
# Table-level hints affect:
#
# 		) Use of the Block Nested-Loop (BNL) and Batched Key Access (BKA) join-processing algorithms
# 			(see BLOCKED NESTED-LOOP AND BATCHED KEY ACCESS JOINS)
#
# 		) Whether derived tables, view references or common table expressions should be merged into the
# 			outer query block, or materialized using an internal temporary table.
#
# These hint types apply to specific tables, or all tables in a query block.
#
# Syntax of table-level hints:
#
# 		hint_name([@query_block_name] [tbl_name [, tbl_name] ---])
# 		hint_name([tbl_name@query_block_name [, tbl_name@query_block_name] ---])
#
# The syntax refers to these terms:
#
# 		) hint_name: These hint names are permitted:
#
# 			) BKA, NO_BKA: Enable or disable BKA for the specified tables.
#
# 			) BNL, NO_BNL: Enable or disable BNL for the specified tables.
#
# 			) MERGE, NO_MERGE: Enable merging for the specified tables, view references or common table expressions; or disable
# 									merging and use materialization instead.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				To use a BNL or BKA hint to enable join buffer for any inner table of an outer join,
# 				join buffering must be enabled for all inner tables of the outer join.
#
# 		) tbl_name: The name of a table used in the statement.
#
# 			The hint applies to all tables that it names. 
#
# 			If the hint names no tables, it applies to all tables of the query block in which it occurs.
#
# 			If a table has an alias, hints must refer to the alias, not the table name.
#
# 			Table names in hints cannot be qualified with schema names.
#
# 		) query_block_name: The query block to which the hint applies.
#
# 			If the hint includes no leading @query_block_name, the hint applies to the query
# 			block in which it occurs.
#
# 			For tbl_name@query_block_name syntax, the hint applies to the named table in the named query block.
#
# 			To assign a name to a query block, see OPTIMIZER HINTS FOR NAMING QUERY BLOCKS.
#
# 	Examples:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ NO_BKA(t1, t2) */ t1 * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 INNER JOIN t3;
# 		SELECT /*+ NO_BNL() BKA(t1) */ t1 * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 INNER JOIN t3;
# 		SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE(dt) */ * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) AS dt;
#
# A table-level hint applies to tables that receives records from previous tables,
# not sender tables.
#
# Consider this statement:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ BNL(t2) */ FROM t1, t2;
#
# If the optimizer chooses to process t1 first, it applies a Block Nested-Loop join to t2 by buffering
# the rows from t1 before starting to read from t2.
#
# If the optimizer instead chooses to process t2 first, the hint has no effect because
# t2 is a sender table.
#
# For the MERGE and NO_MERGE hints, these precedence rules apply:
#
# 		) A hint takes precedence over any optimizer heuristic that is not a technical constraint.
# 			(If providing a hint as a suggestion has no effect, the optimizer has a reason for ignoring it)
#
# 		) A hint takes precedence over the derived_merge flag of the optimizer_switch system variable.
#
# 		) For view references, an ALGORITHM={MERGE|TEMPTABLE} clause in teh view definition takes precedence 
# 			over a hint specified in the query referencing the view.
#
# INDEX-LEVEL OPTIMIZER HINTS
#
# Index-level hints affect which index-processing strategies the optimizer uses for particular tables or indexes.
#
# These hint types affect use of Index Condition Pushdown (ICP), Multi-Range Read (MRR), Index Merge, and 
# range optimizations.
#
# SEE OPTIMIZING SELECT STATEMENTS.
#
# Syntax of index-level hints:
#
# 		hint_name([@query_block_name] tbl_name [index_name [, index_name] ---])
# 		hint_name(tbl_name@query_block_name [index_name [, index_name] ---])
#
# The syntax refers to these terms:
#
# 		) Hint_name: These hint names are permitted:
#
# 			) INDEX_MERGE, NO_INDEX_MERGE: Enable or disable the Index Merge access method for the specified
# 				table or indexes.
#
# 				For information about this access method, see INDEX MERGE OPTIMIZATION.
#
# 				These hints apply to all three Index Merge algorithms.
#
# 				The INDEX_MERGE hint forces the optimizer to use Index Merge for the specified
# 				table using the specified set of indexes.
#
# 				If no index is specified, the optimizer considers all possible index combinations
# 				and selects the least expensive one.
#
# 				The hint may be ignored if the index combination is inapplicable to the given statement.
#
# 				The NO_INDEX_MERGE hint disables Index Merge combinations that involve any of the specified indexes.
#
# 				If the hint specifies no indexes, Index Merge is not permitted for the table.
#
# 			) MRR, NO_MRR: Enable or disable MRR for the specified table or indexes.
#
# 				MRR hints apply only to InnoDB and MyISAM tables.
#
# 				For information about this access method, see MULTI-RANGE READ OPTIMIZATION
#
# 			) NO_ICP: Disable ICP for the specified table or indexes.
#
# 				By default, ICP is a candidate optimization strategy, so there is no hint
# 				for enabling it.
#
# 				For information about this access method, see INDEX CONDITION PUSHDOWN OPTIMIZATION
#
# 			) NO_RANGE_OPTIMIZATION:
#
# 				Disable index range access for the specified table or indexes.
#
# 				This hint also disables Index Merge and Loose Index Scan for the table or indexes.
#
# 				By default, range access is a candidate optimization strategy, so there is no hint for enabling it.
#
# 				This hint may be useful when the number of ranges may be high and range optimization would require many resources.
#
# 			) SKIP_SCAN, NO_SKIP_SCAN:
#
# 				Enable or disable the Skip Scan access method for the specified table or indexes.
#
# 				For information about this access method, see SKIP SCAN RANGE ACCESS METHOD.
#
# 				These hints are available as of MySQL 8.0.13
#
# 				The SKIP_SCAN hint forces the optimizer to use Skip Scan for the specified table using
# 				the specified set of indexes.
#
# 				If no index is specified, the optimizer considers all possible indexes and selects the
# 				least expensive one.
#
# 				The hint may be ignored if the index is inapplicable to the given statement.
#
# 				The NO_SKIP_SCAN hint disables Skin Scan for the specified indexes.
#
# 				If the hint specifies no indexes, Skip Scan is not permitted for the table.
#
# 			) tbl_name: The table to which the hint applies
#
# 			) index_name: The name of an index in the named table.
#
# 				The hint applies to all indexes that it names. If the hint names no indexes,
# 				it applies to all indexes in teh table.
#
# 				To refer to a primary key, use the name PRIMARY.
#
# 				To see the index names for a table, use SHOW_INDEX.
#
# 			) query_block_name: The query block to which the hint applies.
#
# 				If the hint includes no leading @query_block_name, the hint applies
# 				to the query block in which it occurs.
#
# 				For tbl_name@query_block_name syntax, the hint applies to the named table
# 				in teh named query block.
#
# 				To assign a name to a query block, see OPTIMIZER HINTS FOR NAMING QUERY BLOCKS.
#
# Examples:
#
# SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 f3, PRIMARY) */ f2 FROM t1
# 	WHERE f1 = 'o' AND f2 = f3 AND f3 <= 4;
#
# SELECT /*+ MRR(t1) */ * FROM t1 WHERE f2 <= 3 AND 3 <= f3;
#
# SELECT /*+ NO_RANGE_OPTIMIZATION(t3 PRIMARY, f2_idx) */ f1
# 		FROM t3 WHERE f1 > 30 AND f1 < 33;
#
# INSERT INTO t3(f1, f2, f3)
# 		(SELECT /*+ NO_ICP(t2) */ t2.f1, t2.f2, t2.f3 FROM t1, t2
# 		WHERE t1.f1=t2.f1 AND t2.f2 BETWEEN t1.f1
# 		AND t1.f2 AND t2.f2 + 1 >= t1.f1 + 1);
#
# SELECT /*+ SKIP_SCAN(t1 PRIMARY) */ f1, f2
# 	FROM t1 WHERE f2 > 40;
#
# The following examples use the Index Merge hints, but other index-level
# hints follow the same principles regarding hint ignoring and precedence
# of optimizer hints in relation to the optimizer_switch system variable or index hints.
#
# Assume that table t1 has columns a,b,c and d and that indexes named i_a, i_b and i_c exist
# on a, b and c, respectively:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_a, i_b, i_c)*/ * FROM t1
# 			WHERE a = 1 AND b = 2 AND c = 3 AND d = 4;
#
# Index Merge is used for (i_a, i_b, i_c) in this case.
#
# 		SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_a, i_b, i_c)*/ * FROM t1
# 			WHERE b = 1 AND c = 2 AND d = 3;
#
# Index merge is used for (i_b, i_c) in this case
#
# /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_a, i_b) NO_INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_b) */
#
# NO_INDEX_MERGE is ignored because there is a preceding hint for the same table.
#
# 
# /*+ NO_INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_a, i_b) INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_b) */
#
# INDEX_MERGE is ignored because there is a preceding hint for the same table.
#
# For the INDEX_MERGE and NO_INDEX_MERGE optimizer hints, these precedence rules apply:
#
# 		) If an optimizer hint is specified and is applicable, it takes precedence over the Index Merge-related flags of the optimizer_switch system variable.
#
# 			SET optimizer_switch='index_merge_intersection=off';
# 			SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_b, i_c) */ * FROM t1
# 			WHERE b = 1 AND c = 2 AND d = 3;
#
# 		) The hint takes precedence over optimizer_switch. Index merge is used for (i_b, i_c) in this case.
#
# 			SET optimizer_switch='index_merge_intersection=on';
# 			SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_b) */ * FROM t1
# 			WHERE b = 1 AND c = 2 AND d = 3;
#
# 		) The hint specifies only one index, so it is inapplicable, and the optimizer_switch flag(on) applies.
# 			Index Merge is used if the optimizer assesses it to be cost efficient.
#
# 			SET optimizer_switch='index_merge_intersection=off';
# 			SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_b) */ * FROM t1
# 			WHERE b = 1 AND c = 2 AND d = 3;
#
# 		) The hint specifies only one index, so it is inapplicable, and the optimizer_switch(off) applies. Index merge is not used.
#
# ) The USE INDEX, FORCE INDEX, and IGNORE INDEX hints have higher priority than the INDEX_MERGE and NO_INDEX_MERGE optimizer hints.
#
# 		) /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_a, i_b, i_c) */ --- IGNORE INDEX i_a
#
# 			IGNORE INDEX takes precedence over INDEX_MERGE, so index i_a is excluded from the possible ranges for Index Merge.
#
# 		) /*+ NO_INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_a, i_b) */ --- FORCE INDEX i_a, i_b
#
# 			Index Merge is disallowed for i_a, i_b because of FORCE INDEX, but the optimizer is forced to use either i_a or i_b for range or ref access.
# 			There are no conflicts. Both hints are applicable.
#
# 		) If an IGNORE INDEX hint names multiple indexes, those indexes are unavailable for Index Merge
#
# 		) The FORCE INDEX and USE INDEX hints make only the named indexes to be available for Index Merge.
#
# 			SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 i_a, i_b, i_c) */ a FROM t1
# 			FORCE INDEX (i_a, i_b) WHERE c = 'h' AND a = 2 AND b = 'b';
#
# 			The Index Merge intersection access algorithm is used for (i_a, i_b).
#
# 			The same is true if FORCE INDEX is changed to USE INDEX
#
# SUBQUERY OPTIMIZER HINTS
#
# Subquery hints affect whether to use semi-join transformations and which semi-join strategies
# to permit, and, when semi-joins are not used, whether to use subquery materialization or IN-to-EXISTS transformations.
#
# For more information about these optimizations, see OPTIMIZING SUBQUERIES, DERIVED TABLES, VIEW REFERENCES AND COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS for more info.
#
# Syntax of hints that affect semi-join strategies:
#
# 		hint_name([@query_block_name] [strategy [, strategy] ---])
#
# The syntax refers to these terms:
#
# 		) hint_name: These hint names are permitted:
#
# 				) SEMIJOIN, NO_SEMIJOIN: Enable or disable the named semi-join strats.
#
# 		) Strategy: A semi-join strategy to be enabled or disabled.
#
# 						These strategy names are permitted: DUPSWEEDOUT, FIRSTMATCH, LOOSESCAN, MATERIALIZATION.
#
# 						For SEMIJOIN hints, if no strategies are named, semi-join is used if possible based on the strategies
# 						enabled according to the optimizer_switch system variable.
#
# 						If strategies are named but inapplicable for the statement, DUPSWEEDOUT is used.
#
# 						For NO_SEMIJOIN hints, if no strategies are named, semi-join is not used.
#
# 						If strategies are named that rule out all applicable strategies for the statement,
# 						DUPSWEEDOUT is used.
#
# IF one subquery is nested within another and both are merged into a semi-join of an outer query,
# any specifications of semi-join strategies for the innermost query are ignored.
#
# SEMIJOIN and NO_SEMIJOIN hints can still be used to enable or disable semi-join transformations
# for such nested subqueries.
#
# If DUPSWEEDOUT is disabled, on occasion the optimizer may generate a query plan that is far from optimal.
#
# This occurs due to heuristic pruning during greedy search, which can be avoided by setting optimizer_prune_level=0
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ NO_SEMIJOIN(@subq1 FIRSTMATCH, LOOSESCAN) */ * FROM t2
# 			WHERE t2.a IN (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(subq1) */ a FROM t3);
#
# 		SELECT /*+ SEMIJOIN(@subq1 MATERIALIZATION, DUPSWEEDOUT) */ * FROM t2
# 			WHERE t2.a IN (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(subq1) */ a FROM t3);
#
# Syntax of hints that affect whether to use subquery materialization or IN-to-EXISTS transformations:
#
# 		SUBQUERY([@query_block_name] strategy)
#
# The hint name is always SUBQUERY.
#
# For SUBQUERY hints, these strategy values are permitted: INTOEXISTS, MATERIALIZATION.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT id, a IN (SELECT /*+ SUBQUERY(MATERIALIZATION */ a FROM t1) FROM t2;
# 		SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE t2.a IN (SELECT /*+ SUBQUERY(INTOEXISTS */ a FROM t1);
#
# For semi-join and SUBQUERY hints, a leading @query_block_name specifies teh query block
# to which the hint applies.
#
# If the hint includes no leading @query_block_name, the hint applies to the query block
# in which it occurs.
#
# To assign a name to a query block, see OPTIMIZER HINTS FOR NAMING QUERY BLOCKS.
#
# If a hint comment contains multiple subquery hints, the first is used.
#
# If there are other following hints of that type, they produce a warning.
#
# Following hints of other types are silently ignored.
#
# STATEMENT EXECUTION TIME OPTIMIZER HINTS
#
# The MAX_EXECUTION_TIME hint is permitted only for SELECT statements.
#
# It places a limit n(a timeout value in miliseconds) on how long a statement is permitted to execute before
# the server terminates it:
#
# 		MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(N)
#
# Examples with a timeout of 1 second (1000 miliseconds):
#
# 		SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000) */ * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 WHERE ---
#
# The MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(N) hint sets a statement execution timeout of N miliseconds.
#
# If this option is absent or N is 0, the statement timeout established by the max_execution_time system variable applies.
#
# The MAX_EXECUTION_TIME hint is applicable as follows:
#
# 		) For statements with multiple SELECT keywords,, such as unions or statements with subqueries, MAX_EXECUTION_TIME
# 			applies to the entire statement and must appear after the first SELECT.
#
# 		) It applies to read-only SELECT statements. Statements that are not read only are those that invoke a stored function that modifies data as a side effect.
#
# 		) It does not apply to SELECT statements in stored programs and is ignored.
#
# VARIABLE-SETTING HINT SYNTAX
#
# The SET_VAR hint sets the session value of a system variable temporarily (for the duration of a single statement).
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ SET_VAR(sort_buffer_size = 16M) */ name FROM people ORDER BY name;
# 		INSERT /*+ SET_VAR(foreign_key_checks=OFF) */ INTO t2 VALUES(2);
# 		SELECT /*+ SET_VAR(optimizer_switch = 'mrr_cost_based=off') */ 1;
#
# Syntax of the SET_VAR hint:
#
# 		SET_VAR(var_name = value)
#
# var_name names a system variable that has a session value (although not all such variables can be named, as explained later).
# value is the value to assign to the variable; the value must be a scalar.
#
# SET_VAR makes a temporary variable change, as demonstrated by these statements:
#
# 		SELECT @@unique_checks;
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| @@unique_checks 	 |
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| 						1   |
# 		+---------------------+
#
# 		SELECT /* SET_VAR(unique_checks=OFF) */ @@unique_checks;
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| @@unique_checks 	 |
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| 						0   |
# 		+---------------------+
#
# 		SELECT @@unique_checks;
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| @@unique_checks 	 |
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| 						1   |
# 		+---------------------+
#
# With SET_VAR, there is no need to save and restore the variable value.
#
# This enables you to replace multiple statements by a single statement.
# Consider this sequence of statements:
#
# 		SET @saved_val = @@SESSION.var_name;
# 		SET @@SESSION.var_name = value;
# 		SELECT ---
# 		SET @@SESSION.var_name = @saved_val;
#
# The sequence can be replaced by this single statement:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ SET_VAR(var_name = value) ---
#
# Standalone SET statements permit any of these syntaxes for naming session variables:
#
# 		SET SESSION var_name = value;
# 		SET @@SESSION.var_name = value;
# 		SET @@.var_name = value;
#
# Because the SET_VAR hint applies only to session variables, session scope is implicit,
# and SESSION @@SESSION., and @@ are neither needed nor permitted.

# 		 Message: Variable 'collation_server' cannot be set using SET_VAR hint.
#
# SET_VAR syntax permits setting only a single variable, but multiple hints cna be given to set multiple variables:

#
# In this case, the second hint is ignored with a warning that it is conflicting.
#
# A SET_VAR hint is ignored with a warning if no system variable has the specified

#
# For the first statement, there is no max_size variable.

# For the second statement, mrr_cost_flag takes values of on or off, so attempting to set "yes" is incorrect.
#
# In each case, the hint is ignored with a warning.
#
# The  SET_VAR hint is permitted only at the statement level.

#
# RESOURCE GROUP HINT SYNTAX
#
# The RESOURCE_GROUP optimizer hint is used for resource group management (see more under RESOURCE GROUPS).
#
# This hint assigns the thread that executes a statement to the named resource group temporarily (for the
# duration of the statement).
#
# It requires the RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN or RESOURCE_GROUP_USER privilege.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ RESOURCE_GROUP(USR_default) */ name FROM people ORDER BY name;
# 		INSERT /*+ RESOURCE_GROUP(Batch */ INTO t2 VALUES(2);
#
# Syntax of the RESOURCE_GROUP hint:
#
# 		RESOURCE_GROUP(group_name)
#
# group_name indicates the resource group to which the thread should be assigned
# for the duration of statement execution.
#
# If the group is nonexistent, a warning occurs and the hint is ignored.
#
# The RESOURCE_GROUP hint must appear after the initial statement keyword (SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE or DELETE)
#
# An alternative to RESOURCE_GROUP is the SET_RESOURCE_GROUP statement, which nontemporarily assigns threads
# to a resource group.
#
# See SET RESOURCE GROUP SYNTAX for more info.
#
# OPTIMIZER HINTS FOR NAMING QUERY BLOCKS
#
# Table-level, index-level and subquery optimizer hints permit specific query blocks
# to be named as part of their argument syntax.
#
# To create these names, use the QB_NAME hint, which assigns a name to the query block
# in which it occurs:
#
# 		QB_NAME(name)
#
# QB_NAME hints can be used to make explicit in a clear way which query blocks other hints apply to.
#
# They also permit all non-query block name hints to be specified within a single hint comment
# for easier understanding of complex statements.
#
# Consider teh following statement:
#
# 	SELECT ---
# 		FROM (SELECT ---
# 		FROM (SELECT --- FROM ---)) ---
#
# QB_NAME hints assign names to query blocks in the statement:
#
# 	SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(qb1) */ ---
# 		FROM (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(qb2) */ ---
# 		FROM (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(qb3) */ --- FROM ---)) ---
#
# Then other hints can use those names to refer to the appropriate query blocks:
#
# 	SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(qb1) MRR(@qb1 t1) BKA(@qb2) NO_MRR(@qb3t1 idx1, id2) */ ---
# 		FROM (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(qb2) */ ---
# 		FROM (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(qb3) */ --- FROM ---))---
#
# The resulting effect is as follows:
#
# 		) MRR(@qb1_t1) applies to table t1 in query block qb1
#
# 		) BKA(@qb2) applies to query block qb2
#
# 		) NO_MRR(@qb3_t1_idx1, id2) applies to indexes idx1 and idx2 in table t1 in query block qb3.
#
# Query block names are identifiers and follow the usual rules about what names are valid and how to quote them.
# (See more later under SCHEMA OBJECT NAMES)
#
# For example a query block name that contains spaces must be quoted, which can be done using backticks:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ BKA(@`my hint name`) */ ---
# 			FROM (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME(`my hint name`)` */ ---) --- 			
# 
# If the ANSI_QUOTES SQL mode is enabled, it is also possible to quote query block names
# within double quotation marks:
#
# 		SELECT /*+ BKA(@"my hint name") */ ---
# 			FROM (SELECT /*+ QB_NAME("my hint name") */ ---) ---
#
# SWITCHABLE OPTIMIZATIONS
#
# The optimizer_switch system variable enables control over optimizer behavior.
#
# Its value is a set of flags, each of which has a value of on or Off to indicate whether the
# corresponding optimizer behavior is enabled or disabled.

# This variable has global and session values and can be changed at runtime.
#
# The global default can be set at server startup.

#
# 			The semijoin flag controls whether semi-joins are used.
#
# 			If it is set to on, teh firstmatch and loosescan flags enable finer control over the permitted semi-join strategies.
#
# 			If the duplicateweedout semi-join strategy is disabled, it is not used unless all other applicable strategies are also disabled.
#
# 			If semijoin and materialization are both on, semi-joins also use materialization where applicable. These flags are on by default.

# 				Controls materialization (including semi-join materialization)
#
# 			) subquery_materialization_cost_based (default on)
#
# 				Use cost-based materialization choice.
#
# 			The materialization flag controls whether subquery materialization is used.
#
# 			If semijoin and materialization are both on, semi-joins also use materialization
# 			where applicable.
#
# 			These flags are on by default.
#
# 			The subquery_materialization_cost_based flag enables control over the choice between subquery materialization

#
# INDEX HINTS
#
# Index hints gives the optimizer information about how to choose indexes during query processing.
# Index hints, described here, differ from optimizer hints, described in OPTIMIZER HINTS.
#
# Index and optimizer hints may be used separately or together.
#
# Index hints apply only to SELECT statements. 
# (They are accepted by the parser for UPDATE statements but are ignored and have no effect)
# 		
# Index hints are specified following a table name. 
# (For the general syntax for specifying tables in a SELECT statement, see JOIN SYNTAX for more info)
#
# The syntax for referring to an individual table, including index hints, looks like this:
#
# 		tbl_name [[AS] alias] [index_hint_list]
#
# 		index_hint_list:
# 			index_hint [index_hint] ---
#
# 		index_hint:
# 			USE {INDEX|KEY}
# 				[FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] ([index_list])
# 		 | IGNORE {INDEX|KEY}
# 				[FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] (index_list)
# 		 | FORCE {INDEX|KEY}
# 				[FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] (index_list)
#
# 		index_list:
# 			index_name [, index_name] ---
#
# The USE INDEX (index_list) hint tells MySQL to use only one of the named indexes to find rows in the table.
# The alternative syntax IGNORE INDEX (index_list)  tells MySQL to not use some particular index or indexes.
#
# These hints are useful if EXPLAIN shows that MySQL is using the wrong index from the list of possible indexes.
#
# The FORCE INDEX hint acts like USE INDEX (index_list), with the addition that a table scan is assumed to be
# VERY expensive.
#
# In other words, a table scan is used only if there is no way to use one of the named indexes to find rows
# in the table.
#
# Each hint requires index names, not column names. To refer to a primary key, use the name PRIMARY.
# To see the index names for a table, use the SHOW_INDEX statement or the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS table.
#
# An index_name value need not be a full index name. It can be unambiguous prefix of an index name.
# If a prefix is ambiguous, an error occurs.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM table1 USE INDEX (col1_index, col2_index)
# 			WHERE col1=1 AND col2=2 AND col3=3;
#
# 		SELECT * FROM table1 IGNORE INDEX (col3_index)
# 			WHERE col1=1 AND col2=2 AND col3=3;
#
# The syntax for index hints has the following characteristics:
#
# 		) It is syntactically valid to omit index_list for USE_INDEX, which means "use no indexes".
#
# 			Omitting index_list for FORCE_INDEX or IGNORE INDEX is a syntax error.
#
# 		) You can specify the scope of an index hint by adding a FOR clause to the hint.
#
# 			This provides more fine-grained control over optimizer selection of an execution plan for
# 			various phases of query processing. 
#
# 			To affect only the indexes used when MySQL decides how to find rows in the table and how
# 			to process joins, use FOR JOIN.
#
# 			To influence index usage for sorting or grouping rows, use FOR ORDER BY or FOR GROUP BY.
#
# 		) You can specify multiple index hints:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1) IGNORE INDEX FOR ORDER BY (i2) ORDER BY a;
#
# 			It is not an error to name the same index in several hints (even with the same hint):
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1) USE INDEX (i1,i1);
#
# 			However, it is an error to mix USE INDEX and FORCE INDEX for the same table:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX FOR JOIN (i1) FORCE INDEX FOR JOIN (i2);
#
# If an index hint includes no FOR clause, the scope of the hint is to apply to all parts
# of the statement.
#
# For example, this hint:
#
# 		IGNORE INDEX (i1)
#
# is equivalent to this combination of hints:
#
# 		IGNORE INDEX FOR JOIN (i1)
# 		IGNORE INDEX FOR ORDER BY (i1)
# 		IGNORE INDEX FOR GROUP BY (i1)
#
# In MySQL 5.0, hint scope with no FOR clause was to apply only to row retrieval.
#
# To cause the server to use this older behavior when no FOR clause is present, enable
# the old system variable at server startup.
#
# Take care about enabling this variable in a replication setup.
#
# With statement-based binary logging, having different modes for the master and slaves
# might lead to replication errors.
#
# WHen index hints are processed, they are collected in a single list by type (USE, FORCE, IGNORE)
# and by scope (FOR JOIN, FOR ORDER BY, FOR GROUP BY)
#
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 			USE INDEX () IGNORE INDEX (i2) USE INDEX (i1) USE INDEX (i2);
#
# Is equivalent to:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1
# 			USE INDEX (i1,i2) IGNORE INDEX (i2);
#
# The index hints then are applied for each scope in the following order:
#
# 		1. {USE|FORCE} INDEX is applied if present. (If not, the optimizer-determined set of indexes is used)
#
# 		2. IGNORE INDEX is applied over the result of the previous step
#
# 			For example, the following two queries are equivalent:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1) IGNORE INDEX (i2) USE INDEX (i2);
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1);
#
# For FULLTEXT searches, index hints work as follows:
#
# 		) For natural language mode searches, index hints are silently ignored.
#
# 			For example, IGNORE INDEX(i1) is ignored with no warning and the index is still used.
#
# 		) For boolean mode searches, index hints with FOR ORDER BY or FOR GROUP BY are silently ignored.
#
# 			Index hints with FOR JOIN or no FOR modifier are honored.
#
# 			In contrast to how hints apply for non-FULLTEXT searches, the hint is used for all phases
# 			of query execution (finding rows and retrieval, grouping and ordering)
#
# 			This is true even if the hint is given for a non-FULLTEXT index.
#
# 			For example, the following two queries are equivalent:
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t
# 					USE INDEX (index1)
# 					IGNORE INDEX (index1) FOR ORDER BY
# 					IGNORE INDEX (index1) FOR GROUP BY
# 					WHERE --- IN BOOLEAN MODE ---
#
# 				SELECT * FROM t
# 					USE INDEX (index1)
# 					WHERE --- IN BOOLEAN MODE ---
#
# THE OPTIMIZER COST MODEL
#
# To generate execution plans, the optimizer uses a cost model that is based on estimates
# of the cost of various operations that occur during query execution.
#
# The optimizer has a set of compiled-in default "cost constants" available to it to make
# decisions regarding execution plans.
#
# The optimizer also has a database of cost estimates to use during execution plan construction.
#
# These estimates are stored in the server_cost and engine_cost tables in the mysql system
# database and are configurable at any time.
#
# The intent of these tables is to make it possible to easily adjust the cost estimates that the
# optimizer uses when it attempts to arrive at query execution plans.
#
# COST MODEL GENERAL OPERATION
#
# The configurable optimizer cost model works like this:
#
# 		) The server reads the cost model tables into memory at startup and uses the in-memory values at runtime.
#
# 			Any non-NULL cost estimate specified in the tables takes precedence over the corresponding compiled-in
# 			default  cost constant.
#
# 			Any NULL estimate indicates to the optimizer to use the compiled-in default.
#
# 		) At runtime, the server may reread the cost tables. This occurs when a storage engine is dynamically
# 			loaded or when a FLUSH_OPTIMIZER_COSTS statement is executed.
#
# 		) Cost tables enable server administrators to easily adjust cost estimates by changing entries in the tables.
#
# 			It is also easy to revert to a default by setting an entry's cost to NULL.
#
# 			The optimizer uses the in-memory cost values, so changes to the tables should be followed by FLUSH_OPTIMIZER_COSTS
# 			to take effect.
#
# 		) The in-memory cost estimates that are current when a client sessions begins apply throughout that session until it ends.
#
# 			In particular, if the server rereads the cost tables, any changed estimates apply only to subsequently started sessions.
#
# 			Existing sessions are unaffected.
#
# 		) Cost tables are specific to a given server instance. The server does not replicate cost table changes to replication slaves.
#
# THE COST MODEL DATABASE
#
# the optimizer cost model database consists of two tables in the mysql system database that contain cost
# estimate information for operations that occur during query execution:
#
# 		) server_cost : Optimizer cost estimates for general server operations
#
# 		) engine_cost : Optimizer cost estimates for operations specific to particular storage engines
#
# The server_cost table contains these columns:
#
# 		) cost_name
#
# 			The name of a cost estimate used in the cost model.
#
# 			The name is not case-sensitive. If the server does not recognize the cost name
# 			when it reads this tables, it writes a warning to the error log.
#
# 		) cost_value
#
# 			The cost estimate value. If the value is non-NULL, the server uses it as the cost.
# 			Otherwise, it uses the default estimate (the compiled-in value).
#
# 			DBAs can change a cost estimate by updating this column.
#
# 			If the server finds that the cost value is invalid (nonpositive) when it reads this table,
# 			it writes a warning to the error log.
#
# 			To override a default cost estimate (for an entry that specifies NULL), set the cost to
# 			a non-NULL value.
#
# 			To revert to the default, set the value to NULL.
#
# 			Then execute FLUSH_OPTIMIZER_COSTS to tell the server to reread the cost tables.
#
# 		) last_update
#
# 			The time of the last row update.
#
# 		) comment
#
# 			A descriptive comment associated with the cost estimate.
#
# 			DBAs can use this column to provide information about why a cost estimate row stores a particular value.
#
# 		) default_value
#
# 			The default (compiled-in) value for the cost estimate.
#
# 			This column is a read-only generated column that retains its value even if the associated
# 			cost estimate is changed.
#
# 			For rows added to the table at runtime, the value of this column is NULL.
#
# The primary key for the server_cost table is the cost_name column, so it is not possible to create multiple
# entries for any cost estimate.
#
# The server recognizes these cost_name values for the server_cost table:
#
# 		) disk_temptable_create_cost, disk_temptable_row_cost
#
# 			The cost estimates for internally created temporary table stored in a disk-based storage engine
# 			(either InnoDB or MyISAM)
#
# 			Increasing these values increases the cost estimate of using internal temporary tables and makes
# 			the optimizer prefer query plans with less use of them.
#
# 			For information about such tables, see INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLE USE IN MYSQL.
#
# 			The larger default value for these disk parameters compared to the default values for the
# 			corresponding memory parameters (memory_temptable_create_cost, memory_temptable_row_cost)
# 			reflects the greater cost of processing disk-based tables.
#
# 		) key_compare_cost
#
# 			The cost of comparing record keys. Increasing this value causes a query plan that compares
# 			many keys to become more expensive.
#
# 			For example, a query plan that performs a filesort becomes relativily more expensive compared to
# 			a query plan that avoids sorting by using an index.
#
# 		) memory_temptable_create_cost, memory_temptable_row_cost
#
# 			The cost estimates for internally created temporary tables stored in the MEMORY storage engine.
#
# 			Increasing these values increases the cost estimate of using internal temporary tables
# 			and makes the optimizer prefer query plans with less use of them.
#

#
# 			The smaller default  values for these memory parameters compared to the default values for the corresponding
# 			disk parameters (disk_temptable_create_cost, disk_temptable_row_cost) reflects the lesser cost of processing
# 			memory-based tables.
#
# 		) row_evaluate_cost
#
# 			The cost of evaluating record conditions. Increasing this value causes a query plan that examines
# 			rows to become more expensive compared to a query plan that examines fewer rows.
#
# 			For example, a table scan becomes relativily more expensive compared to a range scan that reads fewer rows.
#
# The engine_cost table contains these columns:
#
# 		) engine_name
#
# 			The name of the storage engine to which this cost estimate applies.
# 			The name is not case-sensitive.
#
# 			If the value is default, it applies to all storage engines that have no
# 			named entry of their own.
#
# 			If the server does not recognize the engine name when it reads this table, it writes a warning to the error log
#
# 		) device_type
#
# 			The device type to which this cost estimate applies.
#
# 			The column is intended for specifying different cost estimates for different
# 			storage device types, such as hard disk drives versus solid state drives.
#
# 			Currently, this information is not used and 0 is the only permitted value.
#
# 		) cost_name
#
# 			Same as in the server_cost table.
#
# 		) cost_value
#
# 			Same as in the server_cost table.
#
# 		) last_update
#
# 			Same as in the server_cost table.
#
# 		) comment
#
# 			Same as in the server_cost table
#
# 		) default_value
#
# 			The default (compiled-in) value for the cost estimate.
#
# 			This column is read-only column that retains its value even if the associated
# 			cost estimate is changed.
#
# 			For rows added to the table at runtime, the value of this column is NULL, with the
# 			exception that if the row has the same cost_name value as one of the original rows,
# 			the default value column will have the same value as that row.
#
# The primary key for the engine_cost table is a tuple comprising the (cost_name, engine_name, device_type)
# columns, so it is not possible to create multiple entries for any combination of values in those columns.
#
# The server recognizes these cost_name values for the engine_cost table:
#
# 		) io_block_read_cost
#
# 			The cost of reading an index or data block from disk.
#
# 			Increasing this value causes a query plan that reads many disk blocks to become more expensive compared to
# 			a query plan that reads fewer disk blocks.
#
# 			For example, a table scan becomes relatively more expensive compared to a range scan that reads fewer blocks.
#
# 		) memory_block_read_cost
#
# 			Similar to io_block_read_cost, but represents the cost of reading an index or data block from an in-memory database buffer.
#
# If the io_block_read_cost and memory_block_read_cost values differ, the execution plan may change between
# two runs of the same query.
#
# Suppose that the cost for memory access is less than the cost for disk access.
#
# In that case, at server startup before data has been read into the buffer pool, you may
# get a different plan than after the query has been run because then the data will be in memory.
#
# MAKING CHANGES TO THE COST MODEL DATABASE
#
# For DBAs who wish to change the cost model parameters from their defaults, try doubling
# or halving the value and measuring the effect.
#
# Changes to the io_block_read_cost and memory_block_read_cost parameters are most likely to
# yield worthwhile results.
#
# These parameter values enable cost models for data access methods to take into account the costs
# of reading information from different sources; that is, the cost of reading information from disk
# versus reading information already in a memory buffer.
#
# For example, all other things being equal, setting io_block_read_cost to a value larger than
# memory_block_read_cost causes the optimizer to prefer query plans that read information already
# held in memory to plans that must read from disk.
#
# This example shows how to change the default value for io_block_read_cost:
#
# 		UPDATE mysql.engine_cost
# 			SET cost_value = 2.0
# 			WHERE cost_name = 'io_block_read_cost';
# 		FLUSH OPTIMIZER_COSTS;
#
# This example show how to change the value of io_block_read_cost only for the InnoDB storage engine:
#
# 		INSERT INTO mysql.engine_cost
# 			VALUES ('InnoDB', 0, 'io_block_read_cost', 3.0,
# 			CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Using a slower disk for InnoDB');
# 		FLUSH OPTIMIZER_COSTS;
#
# OPTIMIZER STATISTICS
#
# The column_statistics data dictionary table stores histogram statistics about column values,
# for use by the optimizer in constructing query execution plans.
#
# To perform histogram management, use the ANALYZE_TABLE statement; see ANALYZE TABLE SYNTAX for more
#
# The column_statistics table has these characteristics:
#
# 		) The table contains statistics for columns of all data types except geometry types (spatial data) and JSON.
#
# 		) The table is persistent so that column stats need not be created each time the server starts.
#
# 		) The server performs updates to the table; users do not.
#
# The column_statistics table is not directly accessible by users because it is part of the data dictionary.
#
# Histogram information is available using INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_STATISTICS, which is implemented as a view
# on the data dictionary table.
#
# COLUMN_STATISTICS has these columns:
#
# 		) SCHEMA_NAME, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME: The names of the schema, table, and column for which the stats apply.
#
# 		) HISTOGRAM: A JSON value describing the column stats, stored as a histogram.
#
# Column histograms contain buckets for parts of the range of values stored in the column.
# Histograms are JSON objects to permit flexibility in the representation of column stats.
#
# Here is a sample histogram object:
#
# 		{
# 			"buckets": [
# 				[
# 					1,
# 					0,33---
# 				],
# 				[
# 					2,
# 					0,66---
# 				],
# 				[
# 					3,
# 					1,
# 				]
# 			],
# 			"null-values": 0,
# 			"last-udpated": "2017-03-24 13:32:40.00000";
# 			"sampling-rate": 1,
# 			"histogram-type": "singleton",
# 			"number-of-buckets-specified": 128,
# 			"data-type": "int",
# 			"collation-id": 8
# 		}
#
# histogram objects have these keys:
#
# 		) buckets: The histogram buckets. Bucket structure depends on the histogram type.
#
# 			For singleton histograms, buckets contain two values:
#
#  			) Value 1: The value for the bucket. The type depends on the column data type.
#
# 				) Value 2: A double representing the cumulative frequency for the value.
#
# 							For example, .25 and .75 indicate that 25% and 75% of the values in the columns are less
# 							than or equal to the bucket value.
#
# 			For equi-height histograms, buckets contain four values:
#
# 				) Values 1,2: The Lower and upper inclusive values for the bucket.
# 									The type depends on the column data type.
#
# 				) Value 3: A double representing the cumulative frequency for the value.
#
# 							For example, .25 and .75 indicates that 25% and 75% of the values in the columns are less
# 							than or equal to the bucket upper value. 				
#
#				) Value 4: The number of distinct values in the range from the bucket lower value to its upper value.
#
# 		) null-values: A number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the fraction of column values that are SQL NULL values. If 0, the column contains no NULL values.
#
# 		) last-updated: When the histogram was generated, as a UTC value in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.hhmmss format.
#
# 		) sampling-rate: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the fraction of data that was sampled to create the histogram.
#
# 							A value of 1 means that all of the data was read (no sampling)
#
# 		) histogram-type: The histogram type:
# 	
# 			) singleton: One bucket represents one single value in teh column.
#
# 							This histogram type is created when the number of distinct values in the column
# 							is less than or equal to the number of buckets specified in the ANALYZE_TABLE 
# 							statement that generate the histogram.
#
# 			) equi-height: One bucket represents a range of values.
#
# 							This histogram type is created when the number of distinct values in the column is
# 							greater than the number of buckets specified in the ANALYZE_TABLE statement that generated
# 							the histogram.
#
# 		) number-of-buckets-specified: The number of buckets specified in the ANALYZE_TABLE statement that generated the histogram.
#
# 		) data-type: The type of data this histogram contains.
#
# 						This is needed when reading and parsing histograms from persistent storage into memory.
# 						The value is one int, uint (unsigned integer), double, decimal, datetime or string (includes character and binary strings)
#
# 		) collation-id: The collation ID for the histogram data.
#
# 						It is mostly meaningful when the data-type value is string.
# 						Values corresponding to ID column values in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLLATIONS table.
#
# To extract particular values from the histogram objects, you can use JSON operations.
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT
# 			TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME,
# 			HISTOGRAM->>'$."data-type"' AS 'data-type',
# 			JSON_LENGTH(HISTOGRAM->>'$."buckets"') AS 'bucket-count'
# 		FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_STATISTICS;
#
# 	+-----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
# 	| TABLE_NAME 		| COLUMN_NAME   | data-type    | bucket-count |

#
# The optimizer uses histogram statistics, if applicable, for columns of any data type for which
# statistics are collected.
#
# The optimizer applies histogram statistics to determine row estimates based on the 
# selectivity (filtering effect) of column value comparisons against constant values.
#
# Predicates of these forms qualify for histogram use:
#
# 		col_name = constant
# 		col_name <> constant
# 		col_name != constant
# 		col_name > constant
#
# 		col_name < constant
# 		col_name >= constant
# 		col_name <= constant
#
# 		col_name IS NULL
# 		col_name IS NOT NULL
# 		col_name BETWEEN constant AND constant
# 
# 		col_name NOT BETWEEN constant AND constant
# 		col_name IN (constant[, constant] ---)
# 		col_name NOT IN (constant[, constant] ---)
#
# For example, these statements contain predicates that qualify for histogram use:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount BETWEEN 100.0 AND 300.0;
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col1 = 15 AND col2 > 100;
#
# The requirement for comparison against a constant value includes functions that are
# constant, such as ABS() and FLOOR():
#
# 		SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col1 < ABS(-34);
#
# Histogram stats are useful primarily for nonindexed columns.
#
# Adding an index to a column for which histogram stats are applicable
# might also help the optimizer make row estimates.
#
# The tradeoffs are:
#
# 		) An index must be updated when table data is modified.
#
# 		) A histogram is created or updated only on demand, so it adds no overhead when table data is modified.
# 		
# 			On the other hand, the stats become progressively more out of date when table modifications occur,
# 			until the next time they are updated.
#
# The optimizer prefers range optimizer row estimates to those obtained from histogram stats.
#
# If the optimizer determines that the range optimizer applies, it does not use histogram stats.
#
# For columns that are indexed, row estimates can be obtained for equality comparisons using index dives
# (see RANGE OPTIMIZATION)
#
# In this case, histogram stats are not necessarily useful because index dives can yield better estimates.
#
# In some cases, use of histogram stats may not improve query execution; for example, if the stats are
# out of date.
#
# To check whether this is the case, use ANALYZE TABLE to regenerate the histogram stats, then run the query again.
#
# Alternatively, to disable histogram stats, use ANALYZE_TABLE to drop them.
#
# A different method of disabling histogram stats is to turn off the condition_fanout_filter flag
# of the optimizer_switch system variable (although this may disable other optimizations as well):
#
# 		SET optimizer_switch='condition_fanout_filter=off';
#
# If histogram stats are used, the resulting effect is visible using EXPLAIN.
#
# Consider the following query, where no index is available for column col1:
#
# SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col1 < 24;
#
# If histogram stats indicate that 57% of the rows in t1 satisfy the col1 < 24 predicate,
# filtering can occur even in the absence of an index, and EXPLAIN shows 57.00 in the filtered column.
#
# BUFFERING AND CACHING
#
# MySQL uses several strategies that cache information in memory buffers to increase performance.
#
# InnoDB BUFFER POOL OPTIMIZATION
#
# InnoDB maintains a storage area called the buffer pool for caching data and indexes in memory.
#
# Knowing how the InnoDB buffer pool works, and taking advantage of it to keep frequently accessed
# data in memory, is an important aspect of MySQL tuning.
#
# For an explanation of the inner workings of the InnoDB buffer pool, an overview of its LRU replacement algorithm,
# and general configuration information, see BUFFER POOL.
#
# For additional InnoDB buffer pool configuration and tuning information, see these sections:
#
# 	) CONFIGURING INNODB BUFFER POOL PREFETCHING (READ-AHEAD)
#
# 	) CONFIGURING INNODB BUFFER POOL FLUSHING
#
# 	) MAKING THE BUFFER POOL SCAN RESISTANT

#
# THE MYISAM KEY CACHE
#
# To minimize disk I/O, the MyISAM storage engine exploits a strategy that is used by many DB management
# systems.
#
# It employs a cache mechanism to keep the most frequently accessed table blocks in memory:
#
# 		) For index blocks, a special structure called the key cache (or key buffer) is maintained.
# 			The structure contains a number of block buffers where the most-used index blocks are placed.
#
# 		) For data blocks, MYSQL uses no special cache. Instead it relies on the native operating system file system cache.
#
# This section first describes the basic operation of the MyISAM key cache.
#
# Then it discusses features that improve key cache performance and that enables you
# to better control cache operation:
#
# 		) Multiple sessions can access the cache concurrently.
#
# 		) You can set up multiple key caches and assign table indexes to specific caches.
#
# To control the size of the key cache, use the key_buffer_size system variable.
#
# If this variable is set equal to 0, no key cache is used.
#
# The key cache also is not used if the key_buffer_size value is too small to allocate
# the minimal number of block buffers (8).
#
# When the key cache is not operational, index files are accessed using only the native file system
# buffering provided by the operating system.
#
# (In other words, table index blocks are accessed using the same strategy as that employed for table data blocks)
#
# An index block is a contigous unit of access to the MyISAM index files.
#
# Usually the size of an index block is equal to the size of nodes of the index B-TREE.
#
# (Indexes are represented on disk using a B-tree data structure. Nodes at the bottom of the 
# tree are leaf nodes.
#
# Nodes above the leaf nodes are nonleaf nodes)
#
# All block buffers in a key cache structure are the same size.
#
# This size can be equal to, greater than, or less than size of a table index block. 
# Usually once these two values is a multiple of the other.
#
# When data from any table index block must be accessed, the server first checks whether it is
# available in some block buffer of the key cache.
#
# If it is, the server accesses data in the key cache rather than on disk.
#
# That is, it reads from the cache or writes into it rather than reading from or writing to disk.
#
# Otherwise, the server chooses a cache block buffer containing a different table index block (or blocks)
# and replaces the data there by a copy of required table index block.
#
# As soon as the new index block is in the cache, the index data can be accessed.
#
# If it happens that a block selected for replacement has been modified, the block is
# considered "dirty". In this case, prior to being replaced, its contents are flushed
# to the table index from which it came.
#
# Usually, the server follows an LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy.
#
# When choosing a block for replacement, it selects the least recently used index block.
# To make this choice easier, the key cache module maintains all used blocks in a special list
# (LRU chain) ordered by time of use.
#
# When a block is accessed, it is the most recently used and is placed at the end of the list.
#
# WHen blocks need to be replaced, blocks at the beginning of the list are the least recently
# used and become the first candidates for eviction.
#
# The InnoDB storage engine also uses an LRU algorithm, to manage its buffer pool.
# See BUFFER POOL for more, later.
#
# SHARED KEY CACHE ACCESS
#
# Threads can access key cache buffers simultaneously, subject to the following conditions:
#
# 		) A buffer that is not being updated can be accessed by multiple sessions.
#
# 		) A buffer that is being updated causes sessions that need to use it to wait until the update is complete.
#
# 		) Multiple sessions can initiate requests that result in cache block replacements, as long as they do
# 			not interfere with each other (that is, as long as they need different index blocks, and thus cause
# 			different cache blocks to be replaced)
#
# Shared access to the key cache enables the server to improve throughput significantly.
#
# MULTIPLE KEY CACHES
#
# Shared access to the key cache improves performance but does not eliminate contention among sessions entirely.
#
# They still compete for control structures that manage access to the key cache buffers.
#
# To reduce key cache access contention further, MySQL also provides multiple key caches.
# This feature enables you to assign different table indexes to different key caches.
#
# Where there are multiple key caches, the server must know which cache to use when processing
# queries for a given MyISAM table.
#
# By default, all MyISAM table indexes are cached in the default key cache.
#
# To assign table indexes to a specific key cache, use the CACHE_INDEX statement (See more under CACHE INDEX SYNTAX later).
#
# For example, the following statement assigns indexes from the tables t1, t2, and t3 to the key cache
# named hot_cache:
#
# 		CACHE INDEX t1, t2, t3 IN hot_cache;
# 		+-----------+--------------------+-------------+----------+
# 		| Table 		| Op 						| Msg_type 	  | Msg_text |
# 		+-----------+--------------------+-------------+----------+
# 		| test.t1   | assign_to_keycache | status 	  | OK 	    |
# 		| test.t2   | assign_to_keycache | status 	  | OK 	    |
# 	   | test.t3   | assign_to_keycache | status 	  | OK 		 |
# 		+-----------+--------------------+-------------+----------+
#
# The key cache referred to in a CACHE_INDEX statement can be created by setting its size with a SET_GLOBAL
# parameter setting statement or by using server startup options.
#
# 		SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=128*1024;
# 
# To destroy a key cache, set its size to zero:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=0;
#
# You cannot destroy the default key cache.
# Any attempt to do this is ignored:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL key_buffer_size = 0;
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'key_buffer_size';
# 		+-------------------------+-------------+
# 		| Variable_name 			  | Value 		 |
# 		+-------------------------+-------------+
# 		| key_buffer_size 		  | 8384512 	 |
# 		+-------------------------+-------------+
#
# Key cache variables are structured system variables that have a name and components.
#
# For keycache1.key_buffer_size, keycache1 is the cache variable name and key_buffer_size
# is the cache component.
#
# See STRUCTURED SYSTEM VARIABLES for more info, in regards to syntax used for structured key cache system vars.
#
# By default, table indexes are assigned to the main (default) key cache created at the server startup.
# When a key cache is destroyed, all indexes assigned to it are reassigned to the default key cache.
#
# For a busy server, you can use a strategy that involves three key caches:
#
# 		) A "hot" key cache that takes up 20% of the space allocated for all key caches. Use this for tables that are heavily used for searches but that are not updated.
#
# 		) A "cold" key cache that takes up 20% of the space allocated for all key caches. Use this cache for medium-sized, intensively modified tables, such as temporary tables.
#
# 		) A "warm" key cache that takes up 60% of the key cache space. Employ this as the default key cache, to be used by default for all other tables.
#
# One reason the use of three key caches is beneficial is that access to one key cache structure does not access to the others.
#
# Statements that access tables assigned to one cache do not compete with statements that access tables assigned to
# another cache.
#
# Performance gains occur for other reasons as well:
#
# 		) The hot cache is used only for retrieval queries, so its contents are never modified.
#
# 			Consequently, whenever an index block needs to be pulled in from disk, the 
# 			contents of the cache block chosen for replacement need not be flushed first.
#
# 		) For an index assigned to the hot cache, if there are no queries requiring an index scan,
# 			there is a high probability that the index blocks corresponding to nonleaf nodes of the
# 			index B-Tree remain in the cache.
#
# 		) An update operation most frequently executed for temporary tables is performed much faster
# 			when the updated node is in the cache and need not be read in from a disk first.
#
# 			If the size of the indexes of the temporary tables are comparable with the size of cold key cache,
# 			the probability is very high that the updated node is in the cache.
#
# The CACHE_INDEX statement sets up an association between a table and a key cache, but the association
# is lost each time the server restarts.
#
# If you want the association to take effect each time the server starts, one way to accomplish this is to
# use an option file:
#
# 		Include variable settings that configure your key caches, and an init-file option that names
# 		a file containing CACHE_INDEX statements to be executed.
#
# 		For example:
#
# 		key_buffer_size = 4G
# 		hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 2G
# 		cold_cache.key_buffer_size = 2G
# 		init_file=/path/to/data-directory/mysqld_init.sql
#
# The statements in mysqld_init.sql are executed each time the server starts.
#
# The file should contain one SQL statement per line.
# The following example assigns several tables each to hot_cache and cold_cache:
#
# 		CACHE INDEX db1.t1, db1.t2, db2.t3 IN hot_cache
# 		CACHE INDEX db1.t4, db2.t5, db2.t6 IN cold_cache
#
# MIDPOINT INSERTION STRATEGY
#
# By default, the key cache management system uses a simple LRU strategy for choosing key
# cache blocks to be evicted, but it also supports a more sophisticated method called the midpoint
# insertion strategy.
#
# When using the midpoint insertion strategy, the LRU chain is divided into two parts:
#
# 		a hot sublist and a warm sublist.
#
# The division point between two parts is not fixed, but the key cache management system
# takes care that the warm part is not "too short", always containing at least key_cache_division_limit percent
# of the key cache blocks.
#
# key_cache_division_limit is a component of structured key cache variables, so its value is a parameter
# that can be set per cache.
#
# When an index block is read from a table into the key cache, it is placed at the end of the warm sublist.
#
# After a certain number of hits (accesses of the block), it is promoted to the hot sublist.
#
# At present, the number of hits required to promote a block (3) is the same for all index blocks.
#
# A block promoted into the hot sublist is placed at the end of the list.
#
# The block then circulates within this sublist. IF the block stays at the beginning of the sublist
# for a long enough time, it is demoted to the warm sublist.
#
# This time is determined by the value of the key_cache_age_threshold component of the key cache.
#
# The threshold value perscribes that, for a key cache containing N blocks, the block at the beginning
# of the hot sublist not accessed within the last N * key_cache_age_threshold / 100 hits is to be moved
# to the beginning of the warm sublist.
#
# The midpoint insertion strategy enables you to keep more-valued blocks away in the  cache.
#
# If you prefer to use the plain LRU strategy, leave the key_cache_division_limit value set
# to its default of 100.
#
# The midpoint insertion strategy helps to improve performance when execution of a query that requires
# an index scan effectively pushes out of the cache all the index blocks corresponding to valuable
# high-level B-tree nodes.
#
# To avoid this, you must use a midpoint insertion strategy with the key_cache_division_limit set to much
# less than 100.
#
# Then valuable frequently hit nodes are preserved in teh hot sublist during an index scan operation as well.
#
# INDEX PRELOADING
#
# If there are enough blocks in a key cache to hold blocks of an entire index, or at least the blocks corresponding
# to its nonleaf nodes, it makes sense to preload the key cache with index blocks before starting to use it.
#
# Preloading enables you to put the table index blocks into a key cache buffer in teh most efficient way:
# 
# By reading the index blocks from disk sequentially.
#
# Without preloading, the blocks are still placed into the key cache as needed by queries.
#
# Although the blocks will stay in the cache, because there are enough buffers for all of them,
# they are fetched from disk in random order, and not sequentially.
#
# To preload an index into a cache, use the LOAD_INDEX_INTO_CACHE statement.
#
# For example, the following statement preloads nodes (index blocks) of indexes of the tables
# t1 and t2:
#
# 		LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE t1, t2 IGNORE LEAVES;
# 		+-----------+--------------+----------+------------+
# 		| Table 	   | Op 		  		| Msg_type | Msg_text   |
# 		+-----------+--------------+----------+------------+
# 		| test.t1 	| preload_keys | status   | OK 		   |
# 		| test.t2 	| preload_keys | status   | OK 			|
# 		+-----------+--------------+----------+------------+
#
# The IGNORE LEAVES modifier causes only blocks for the nonlead nodes of the index to be preloaded.
#
# Thus, the statement shown preloads all index blocks from t1, but only blocks for the nonleaf
# nodes from t2.
#
# If an index has been assigned to a key cache using a CACHE_INDEX statement, preloading places
# index blocks into that cache.
#
# Otherwise, the index is loaded into the default key cache.
#
# KEY CACHE BLOCK SIZE
#
# It is possible to specify the size of the block buffers for an individual key cache using
# the key_cache_block_size variable.
#
# This permits tuning of the performance of I/O operations for index files.
#
# The best performance for I/O operations is achieved when the size of read buffers
# is equal to the size of the native operating system I/O buffers.
#
# But setting the size of key nodes equal to the size of the I/O buffer does not always
# ensure the best overall performance.
#
# When reading the big leaf nodes, the server pulls in a lot of unecessary data, effectively
# preventing reading other leaf nodes.
#
# To control the size of blocks in the .MYI index file of MyISAM tables, use the --myisam-block-size
# option at server startup.
#
# RESTRUCTURING A KEY CACHE
#
# A key cache can be restructured at any time by updating its parameter values.
# for example:
#
# 		SET GLOBAL cold_cache.key_buffer_size=4*1024*1024;
#
# If you assign to either the key_buffer_size or key_cache_block_size key cache component 
# a value that differs from the component's current value, the server destroys the cache's old structure
# and creates a new one based on the new values.
#
# If the cache contains any dirty blocks, the server saves them to disk before destroying and 
# re-creating the cache.
#
# Restructuring does not occur if you change other key cache parameters.
#
# When restructuring a key cache, the server first flushes the contents of any dirty buffers to disk.
#
# After that, the cache contents become unavailable. However, restructuring does not
# block queries that need to use indexes assigned to the cache.
#
# INstead, the server directly accesses the table indexes using native file system caching.
#
# File system caching is not as efficient as using a key cache, so although queries execute,
# a slowdown can be anticipated.
#
# After the cache has been restructured, it becomes available again for caching indexes assigned
# to it, and the use of file system  caching for the indexes ceases.
#
# CACHING OF PREPARED STATEMENTS AND STORED PROGRAMS
#
# For certain statements that a client might execute multiple times during a session, the server converts
# the statement to an internal structure and caches that structure to be used during execution.
#
# Caching enables the server to perform more efficiently because it avoids the overhead of reconverting
# the statement should it be needed again during the session.
#
# Conversion and caching occurs for these statements:
#
# 		) Prepared statements, both those processed at the SQL level (using the PREPARE statement) and those
# 			processed using the binary client/server protocol (using the mysql_stmt_prepare() C API function)
#
# 			The max_prepared_stmt_count system variable controls the total number of statements the server caches.
#
# 			(The sum of the number of prepared statements across all sessions)
#
# 		) Stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers, and events).
#
# 			In this case, teh server converts and caches the entire program body.
#
# 			The stored_program_cache system variable indicates the approximate number of stored
# 			programs the server caches per session.
#
# The server maintains caches for prepared statements and stored programs on a per-session basis.
#
# Statements cached for one session are not accessible to other sessions. When a session ends,
# the server discards any statements cached for it.
#
# When the server uses a cached internal statement structure, it must take care taht the structure does not
# go out of date.
#
# Metadata changes can occur for an object used by the statement, causing a mismatch between the current
# object definition and the definition as represented in the internal statement structure.
#
# Metadata changes occur for DDL statements such as those that create drop, alter, rename or truncate tables,
# or that analyze, optimize or repair tables.
#
# Table content changes (for example, with INSERT or UPDATE) do not change metadata, nor do SELECT statements.
#
# Here is an illustration of the problem, Suppose that a client prepares this statement:
#
# 		PREPARE s1 FROM 'SELECT * FROM t1';
#
# The SELECT * expands in teh internal structure to the list of columns in the table.
#
# If the set of columns in the table is modified with ALTER TABLE, the prepared statement goes otu of date.
#
# If the server does not detect this change the next time the client executes s1, the prepared statement returns incorrect results.
#
# To avoid problems caused by metadata changes to tables or views referred to by the prepared statement, the server
# detects these changes and automatically prepares the statement when it is next executed.
#
# That is, the server reparses the statement and rebuilds the internal structure.
#
# Reparsing also occurs after referenced tables or views are flushed from the table definition cache,
# either implicitly to make room for new entries in the cache, or explicitly due to FLUSH_TABLES.
#
# Similarly, if changes occur to objects used by a stored program, the server reparses affected statements
# within the program.
#
# The server also detects metadata changes for objects in expressions. These might be used in statements specific
# to stored programs, such as DECLARE CURSOR or flow-control statements such as IF, CASE, and RETURN.
#
# To avoid reparsing entire stored programs, the server reparses affected statements or expressions within a program
# 	only as needed.
#
# 	Examples:
#
# 		) Suppose that metadata for a table or view is changed. Reparsing occurs for a SELECT * that accesses the table or view,
# 			but not for a SELECT * that does not access the table or view.
#
# 		) When a statement is affected, the server reparses it only partially if possible. Consider this CASE statement:
#
# 			CASE case_expr 
# 				WHEN when_expr1 ---
# 				WHEN when_expr2 ---
# 				WHEN when_expr3 ---
# 				---
# 			END CASE
#
# 		If a metadata change affects only WHEN when_expr3, that expression is reparsed.
# 		case_expr and the other WHEN expressions are not reparsed.
#
# Reparsing uses the default DB and SQL mode that were in effect for the original conversion to internal form.
#
# The server attempts reparsing up to three times. An error occurs if all attempts fail.
#
# Reparsing is automatic, but to the extent that it occurs, diminishes prepared statements and stored program
# performance.
#
# For prepared statements, the Com_stmt_reprepare status variable tracks the number of repreparations.
#
# OPTIMIZING LOCKING OPERATIONS
#
# MySQL manages contention for table contents using locking:
#
# 		) Internal locking is performed within the MySQL server itself to manage contention for table contents by multiple threads.
#
# 			This type of locking is internal because it is performed entirely by the server, and involves no other programs.
#
# 			See INTERNAL LOCKING METHODS, later.
#
# 		) External locking occurs when the server and other programs lock MyISAM table files to coordinate among themselves
# 			which program can access the tables at which time.
#
# 			See EXTERNAL LOCKING, later.
#
# INTERNAL LOCKING METHODS
#
# This section discusses internal locking; that is, locking performed within the MySQL server itself to manage
# contention for table contents by multiple sessions.
#
# This type of locking is internal because it is performed entirely by the server and involves no other programs.
#
# For locking performed on MYSQL files by other programs, see EXTERNAL LOCKING.
#
# 		) Row-level Locking
#
# 		) Table-Level Locking
#
# 		) Choosing the Type of Locking
#
# ROW-LEVEL LOCKING
#
# MySQL uses row-level locking for InnoDB tables to support simultaneous write access by multiple sessions,
# making them suitable for multi-user, highly concurrent and OLTP applications.
#
# To avoid deadlocks when performing multiple concurrent write operations on a single InnoDB tables,
# acquire necessary locks at the start of the transaction by issuing a SELECT --- FOR UPDATE statement
# for each group of rows expected to be modified, even if the data changes come later in teh transaction.
#
# If transactions modify or lock more than one table, issue the applicable statements in the same order
# within each transaction.
#
# Deadlocks affect performance rather than representing a serious error, because InnoDB automatically detects
# deadlock conditions by default and rolls back one of the affected transactions.
#
# On high concurrency systems, deadlock detection can cause a slowdown when numerous threads wait for the same lock.
#
# At times, it may be more efficient to disable deadlock detection and rely on the innodb_lock_wait_timeout setting
# for transaction rollback when a deadlock occurs.
#
# Deadlock detection can be disabled using the innodb_deadlock_detect configuration option.
#
# Advantages of row-level locking:
#
# 		) Fewer lock conflicts when different sessions access different rows.
#
# 		) Fewer changes for rollbacks.
#
# 		) Possible to lock a single row for a long time
#
# TABLE-LEVEL LOCKING
#
# MySQL uses table-level locking for MyISAM, MEMORY and MERGE tables, permitting only one session to update
# those tables at a time.
#
# This locking level makes these storage engines more suitable for read-only, read-mostly or single-user applications.
#
# These storage engines avoid deadlocks by always requesting all needed locks at once at the beginning 
# of a query and always locking the tables in teh same order.
#
# The tradeoff is that this strategy reduces concurrency; other sessions that want to modify the table must wait
# until the current data change statement finishes.
#
# Advantages of table-level locking:
#
# 		) Relativily little memory required (row locking requires memory per row or group of rows locked)
#
# 		) Fast when used on a large part of the tables because only a single lock is involved.
#
# 		) Fast if you often do GROUP BY operations on a large part of the data or must scan the entire table frequently.
#
# MySQL grants table write locks as follows:
#
# 		1. If there are no locks on teh table, put a write lock on it.
#
# 		2. Otherwise, put the lock request in the write lock queue.
#
# MySQL grants table read locks as follows:
#
# 		1. If there are no write locks on the table, put a read lock on it.
#
# 		2. Otherwise, put the lock request in the read lock queue.
#
# Table updates are given higher priority than table retrievals.
#
# Therefore, when a lock is released, the lock is made available to the requests
# in the write lock queue and then to the requests in teh read lock queue.
#
# This ensures that updates to a table are not "starved" even when there is
# heavy SELECT activity for the table.
#
# However, if there are many updates for a table, SELECT statements wait until there
# are no more updates.
#
# For information on altering the priority of reads and writes, see TABLE LOCKING ISSUES.
#
# You can analyze the table lock contention on your system by checking the Table_locks_immediate
# and Table_locks_waited status variables, which indicate the number of times that
# requests for table locks could be granted immediately and the number that had to
# wait, respectively:
#
# 		SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Table%';
# 		+-------------------------------+----------+
# 		| Variable_name 					  |   Value  |
# 		+-------------------------------+----------+
# 		| Table_locks_immediate 		  | 1151552  |
# 		| Table_locks_waited 			  | 15324 	 |
# 		+-------------------------------+----------+
#
# The Performance Schema lock tables also provide locking information. See PERFORMANCE SCHEMA LOCK TABLES, later.
#
# The MyISAM storage engine supports concurrent inserts to reduce contention between readers and writers
# for a given table: 
#
# If a MyISAM table has no free blocks in the middle of hte data file, rows are always
# inserted at the end of the data file.
#
# In this case, you can freely mix concurrent INSERT and SELECT statements for a MyISAM table without locks.
#
# That is, you can insert rows into a MyISAM table at the same time other clients are reading from it.
#
# Holes can result from rows having been deleted from or updated in the middle of the table.
#
# if there are holes, concurrent inserts are disabled but are enabled again automatically when all
# holes have been filled with new data.
#
# To control this behavior, use the concurrent_insert system variable. See CONCURRENT INSERTS.
#
# If you acquire a table lock explicitly with LOCK_TABLES, you can request a READ LOCAL lock rather than
# a READ lock to enable other sessions to perform concurrent inserts while you have the table locked.
#
# To perform many INSERT and SELECT operations on a table t1 when concurrent inserts are not possible,
# you can insert rows into a temporary table temp_t1 and update the real table with the rows
# from the temporary table:
#
# 		LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, temp_t1 WRITE;
# 		INSERT INTO t1 SELECT * FROM temp_t1;
# 		DELETE FROM temp_t1;
# 		UNLOCK TABLES;
#
# CHOOSING THE TYPE OF LOCKING
#
# Generally, table locks are superior to row-level locks in the following cases:
#
# 		) Most statements for the table are reads.
#
# 		) Statements for the table are a mix of reads and writes, where writes are updates or deletes for a single
# 			row that can be fetched with one key read:
#
# 			UPDATE tbl_name SET column=value WHERE unique_key_col=key_value;
# 			DELETE FROM tbl_name WHERE unique_key_col=key_value;
#
# 		) SELECT combined with concurrent INSERT statements, and very few UPDATE or DELETE statements.
#
# 		) Many scans or GROUP BY operations on the entire table without any writers.
#
# With higher-level locks, you can more easily tune applications by supporting locks of different types,
# because the lock overhead is less than for row-level locks.
#
# Options other than row-level locking:
#
# 		) Versioning (Such as that used in MySQL for concurrent inserts) where it is possible to have one writer at the same time
# 			as many readers.
#
# 			This means that the database or table supports different views for the data depending on when access begins.
#
# 			Other common terms for this are "time travel", "copy on write", or "copy on demand"
#
# 		) Copy on demand is in many cases superior to row-level locking. However, in the worst case - it can use much more memory
# 			than using normal locks.
#
# 		) Instead of using row-level locks, you can employ application-level locks, such as those provided by
# 			GET_LOCK() and RELEASE_LOCK() in MySQL.
#
# 			These are advisory locks, so they work only with applications that cooperate with each other.
#
# 			See more, under LOCKING FUNCTIONS.
#
# TABLE LOCKING ISSUES
#
# InnoDB tables use row-level locking so that multiple sessions and applications can read from and
# write to the same table simultaneously, without making each other wait or producing inconsistent results.
#
# For this storage engine, avoid using the LOCK_TABLES statement, because it does not offer any extra
# protection, but instead reduces concurrency.
#
# The automatic row-level locking makes these tables suitable for your busiest database with your most
# important data, whilst also simplifying application logic since you do not need to lock and unlock tables.
#
# Consequently, the InnoDB storage engine is the default in MySQL.
#
# MySQL uses table locking (instead of page, row or column locking) for all storage engines except InnoDB.
#
# The locking operations themselves do not have much overhead. But because only one session can write to a table
# at any one time, for best performance with these other storage engines, use them primarily for tables that
# are queried often and rarely inserted into or updated.
#
# PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS FAVORING InnoDB
#
# When choosing whether to create a table using InnoDB or a different storage engine, keep in mind
# the following disadvantages of table locking:
#
# 		) Table locking enables many sessions to read from a table at the same time, but if a session
# 			wants to write to a table, it must first get exclusive access, meaning it might have to
# 			wait for other sessions to finish with the table first.
#
# 			During the update, all other sessions that want to access this particular table must wait
# 			until the update is done.
#
# 		) Table locking causes problems when a session is waiting because the disk is full and free
# 			space needs to become available before the session can proceed.
#
# 			In this case, all sessions that want to access the problem table are also put in
# 			a waiting state until more disk space is made available.
#
# 		) A SELECT statement that takes a long time to run prevents other sessions from updating the table
# 			in the meantime, making the other sessions appear slow or unresponsive.
#
# 			While a session is waiting to get exclusive access to the table for updates, other sessions that
# 			issue SELECT statements will queue up behind it, reducing concurrency even for read-only sessions.
#
# WORKAROUNDS FOR LOCKING PERFORMANCE ISSUES
#
# The following items describe some ways to avoid or reduce contention caused by table locking:
#
# 		) Consider switching the table to the InnoDB storage engine, either using CREATE TABLE --- ENGINE=INNODB
# 			during setup, or using ALTER TABLE --- ENGINE=INNODB for an existing table.
#
# 			See THE INNODB STORAGE ENGINE for more details about this storage engine.
#
# 		) Optimize SELECT statements to run faster so that they lock tables for a shorter time.
#
# 			You might have to create some summary tables to do this.
#
# 		) Start mysqld with --low-priority-updates.
#
# 			 For storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM, MEMORY and MERGE),
# 			 this gives all statements that update (modify) a table lower priority than SELECT statements.
#
# 			 In this case, the second SELECT statement in the preceding scenario would execute before
# 	   	 the UPDATE statement, and would not wait for the first SELECT To finish.
#
# 		) To specify that all updates issued in a specific connection should be done with low priority, set the low_priority_updates
# 			server system variable to 1.
#
# 		) To give a specific INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement lower priority, use the LOW_PRIORITY attribute.
#
# 		) To give a specific SELECT statement higher priority, use the HIGH_PRIORITY attribute. See SELECT SYNTAX for more info.
#
# 		) Start mysqld with a low value for the max_write_lock_count system variable to force MySQL to temporarily elevate
# 			the priority of all SELECT statements that are waiting for a table after a specific number of inserts to the table occur.
#
# 			THis permits READ locks after a certain number of WRITE locks.
#
# 		) If you have problems with INSERT combined with SELECT, consider switching to MyISAM tables, which support
# 			concurrent SELECT and INSERT statements. (see CONCURRENT INSERTS, for more info, later)
#
# 		) If you have problems with mixed SELECT and DELETE statements, the LIMIT option to DELETE may help. See more under, DELETE SYNTAX, later.
#
# 		) Using SQL_BUFFER_RESULT with SELECT statements can help to make the duration of the table locks shorter. See SELECT SYNTAX, later.
#
# 		) Splitting tables contents into separate tables may help, by allowing queries to run against columns in one table,
# 			while updates are confined to columns in a different table.
#
# 		) You could change the locking code in mysys/thr_lock.c to use a single queue. In this case, write locks and read locks would have
# 			the same priority, which might help some applications.
#
# CONCURRENT INSERTS
#
# The MyISAM storage engine supports concurrent inserts to reduce contention betwen readers and writers for a given table:
#
# If a MyISAM table has no holes in the data file (deleted rows in the middle), an INSERT statement can be executed to add
# rows to the end of the table at the same time that SELECT statements are reading rows from the table.
#
# If there are multiple INSERT statements, they are queued and performed in sequence, concurrently with the SELECT statements.
#
# The results of a concurrent INSERT may not be visible instantly.
#
# The concurrent_insert system variable can be set to modify the concurrent-insert processing.
#
# By default, the variable is set to AUTO (or 1) and concurrent inserts are handled as just described.
#
# If concurrent_insert is set to NEVER (or 0), concurrent inserts are disabled. If the variable is set to ALWAYS (or 2),
# concurrent inserts at the end of the table are permitted even for tables that have deleted rows.
#
# See also the description of the concurrent_insert system variable.
#
# If you are using the binary log, concurrent inserts are converted to normal inserts for CREATE --- SELECT
# or INSERT --- SELECT statements.
#
# This is done to ensure that you can re-create an exact copy of your tables by applying the log during a backup
# operation.
#
# See THE BINARY LOG, for more information.
#
# In addition, for those statements a read lock is placed on the selected-from table such that inserts
# into that table are blocked.
#
# The effect is that concurrent inserts for that table must wait as well.
#
# With LOAD_DATA_INFILE, if you specify CONCURRENT with a MyISAM table that satisfies the condition
# for concurrent inserts (taht is, it contains no free blocks in the middle), other sessions can retrieve
# data from the table while LOAD_DATA is executing.
#
# Use of the CONCURRENT option affects the performance of LOAD_DATA a bit, even if no other
# session is using the table at the same time.
#
# If you specify HIGH_PRIORITY, it overrides the effect of the --low-priority-updates option if the server
# was started with that option. It also causes concurrent inserts not to be used.
#
# For LOCK_TABLE, the difference between READ LOCAL and READ is that READ LOCAL permits nonconflicting INSERT
# statements (concurrent inserts) to execute while the lock is held.
#
# However, this cannot be used if you are going to manipulate the database using processes external to the 
# server while you hold the lock.
#
# METADATA LOCKING
#
# MySQL uses metadata locking to manage concurrent access to database objects and to ensure data consistency.
# Metadata locking applies not just to tables, but also to schemas, stored programs (procedures, functions, triggers and scheduled events)
# and tablespaces.
#
# The Performance Schema metadata_locks table exposes metadata lock information, which can be useful for seeing
# which session hold locks, are blocked waiting for lock, and so forth.
#
# For details, see THE METADATA_LOCKS TABLE later.
#
# Metadata locking does involve some overhead, which increases as query volume increases.
#
# Metadata contention increases the more the multiple queries attempt ot access the same objects.
#
# Metadata locking is not a replacement for the table definition cache, and its mutexes and locks differ
# from the LOCK_open mutex. The following discussion provides some information about how metadata locking works.
#
# METADATA LOCK ACQUISITION
#
# If there are multiple waiters for a given lock, the highest-priority lock request is satisfied first, with
# an exception related to the max_write_lock_count system variable.
#
# Write lock requests have higher priority than read lock requests.
#
# However, if max_write_lock_count is set to some low value (say, 10), read lock requests may be preferred
# over pending write lock requests if the read lock requests have already been pqssed over in favor of 10 write
# lock requests.
#
# Normally, this behavior does not occur because max_write_lock_count by default has a very large value.
#
# Statements acquire metdata locks one by one, not simultaenously, and lock acquisition occurs in name order:
#
# 		) This RENAME TABLE statement renames tbla to something else, and renames tblc to tbla:
#
# 				RENAME TABLE tbla TO tbld, tblc TO tbla;
#
# 			The statement acquires metadata locks, in order, on tbla, tblc and tbld (because tbld follows tblc in name order).
#
# 		) This slightly different statement also renames tbla to something else, and renames tblc to tbla:
#
# 				RENAME TABLE tbla TO tblb, tblc TO tbla
#
# 			In this case, the statement acquires metadata locks in order, on tbla, tblb and tblc (because tblb precedes tblc in name order).
#
# Both statements acquire locks on tbla and tblc, in that order, but differ in whether the lock on the remaining table
# name is acquired before or after tblc.
#
# Metadata lock acquisition order can make a difference in operation outcome when multiple transactions execute concurrently,
# as the following example illustrates.
#
# Begin with two tables x and x_new that have identical structure. Three clients issue statements that involve these tables:
#
# 		Client 1:
#
# 			LOCK TABLE x WRITE, x_new WRITE;
#
# 		The statement requests and acquires write locks in name order on x and x_new
#
# 		Client 2:
#
# 			INSERT INTO x VALUES(1);
#
# 		The statement requests and blocks waiting for a write lock on x.
#
# 		Client 3:
#
# 			RENAME TABLE x TO x_old, x_new TO x;
#
# 		The statement requests exclusive locks in name order on x, x_new and x_old but blocks waiting for the lock on x.
#
# 		Client 1:
#
# 			UNLOCK TABLES
#
# The staetment releases the write locks on x and x_new. 
#
# The exclusive lock request for x by Client 3 has higher priority than the write lock request by Client 2,
# so Client 3 acquires its lock on x, then also on x_new and x_old, performs the renaming, and releases its locks.
#
# Client 2 then acquires its lock on x, performs the insert and releases its lock.
#
# Lock acquisition order results in the RENAME_TABLE executing before the INSERT.
#
# The x into which the insert occurs is the table that was named x_new when Client 2
# issued the insert and was renamed to x by Client 3:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM x;
# 		+-----------------+
# 		| i 					|
# 		+-----------------+
# 		| 1 					|
# 		+-----------------+
#
# 		SELECT * FROM x_old;
# 		Empty set (0.01 sec)
#
# Now begin instead with tables named x and new_x that have identical structure.
# Again, three clients issue statements that involve these tables:
#
# 		Client 1:
#
# 			LOCK TABLE x WRITE, new_x WRITE;
#
# 		The statement requests and acquires write locks in name order on new_x and x.
#
# 		Client 2:
#
# 			INSERT INTO x VALUES(1);
#
# 		The statement requests and blocks waiting for a write lock on x.
#
# 		Client 3:
#
# 			RENAME TABLE x TO old_x, new_x TO x;
#
# 		The statement requests exclusive locks in name order on new_x, old_x and x, but blocks waiting
# 		for the lock on new_x.
#
# 		Client 1:
#
# 		UNLOCK TABLES;
#
# The statements releases the write locks on x and new_x.
#
# FOr x, the only pending request is by Client 2, so CLient 2 acquires its lock,
# performs the insert and releases the lock.
#
# FOr new_x, the only pending request is by Client 3, which is permitted to acquire that lock
# (and also the lock on old_x).
#
# The rename operation still blocks for the lock on x until the Client 2 insert finishes and releases
# its lock.
#
# Then client 3 acquires the lock on X, performs the rename, and releases its lock.
#
# In this case, lock acquisition order results in the INSERT executing before the RENAME_TABLE.
# The x into which the insert occurs is the original x, now renamed old_x by the rename operation:
#
# SELECT * FROM x;
# Empty set (0.01 sec)
#
# SELECT * FROM old_x;
# +----------+
# | i 		 |
# +----------+
# | 1 		 |
# +----------+
#
# If order of lock acquisition in concurrent statements makes a difference to an application
# in operation outcome, as in the preceding example, you may be able to adjust the table names
# to affect the order of lock acquisition.
#
# Metadata locks are extended, as necessary, to tables by a foreign key constraint to prevent conflicting
# DML and DDL operations from executing concurrently on the related tables.
#
# When updating a parent table,, a metadata lock is taken on the child table while updating foreign key
# metadata.
#
# Foreign key metadata is owned by the child table.
#
# METADATA LOCK RELEASE
#
# To ensure transaction serializability, the server must not permit one session to perform a data
# definition language (DDL) statement on a table that is used in an uncompleted explicitly or implicitly
# started transaction in another session.
#
# The server achieves this by acquiring metadata locks on tables used within a transaction and
# deferring release of those locks until the transaction ends.
#
# A metadata lock on a table prevents changes to the table's structure.
#
# This locking approach has the implication that a table that is being used by a transaction
# within one session cannot be used in DDL statements by other sessions until the transaction ends.
#
# This principle applies not only to transactional tables, but also to nontransactional tables.
#
# Suppose that a session begins a transaction that uses transactional table t and nontransactional
# table nt as follows:
#
# 		START TRANSACTION;
# 		SELECT * FROM t;
# 		SELECT * FROM nt;
#
# The server holds metadata locks on both t and nt until the transaction ends.
#
# If another session attempts a DDL or write lock operation on either table,
# it blocks unitl metadata lock releases at transaciton end.
#
# For example, a second session blocks if it attempts any of these operations:
#
# 		DROP TABLE t;
# 		ALTER TABLE t ---;
# 		DROP TABLE nt;
# 		ALTER TABLE nt ---;
# 		LOCK TABLE t --- WRITE;
#
# The same behavior applies for the LOCK_TABLES_---_READ.
#
# That is, explicitly or implicitly started transactions that update any table 
# (transactional or nontransactional) will block and be blocked by LOCK TABLES --- READ for taht table.
#
# If the server acquires metadata locks for a statement that is syntatically valid but fails during execution,
# it does not release the locks early.
#
# Lock release is still deferred to the end of the transaction because the failed statement is written to the 
# binary log and locks protect log consistency.
#
# In autocommit mode, each statement is in effect a complete transaction, so metadata locks acquired for the
# statement are held only to the end of the statement.
#
# Metadata locks acquired during a PREPARE statement are releasesed once the statement has been prepared, even if
# preparation occurs within a multiple-statement transaction.
#
# As of MySQL 8.0.13, for XA transactions in PREPARED state, metadata locks are maintained across client disconnects
# and server restarts, until XA_COMMIT or XA_ROLLBACK is executed.
#
# EXTERNAL LOCKING
#
# External locking is the use of file system locking to manage contention for MyISAM database tables by multiple processes.
#
# External locking is used in situations where a single process such as the MySQL server cannot be assumed to be hte
# only process that requires access to tables.
#
# Here are some examples:
#
# 		) If you run multiple servers that use the same DB directory (not recommended), each server must have external locking enabled.
#
# 		) If you use myisamchk to perform table maintenance operations on MyISAM tables, you must either ensure that hte sever
# 			is not running, or that hte server has external locking enabled so that it locks table files as necessary to coordinate with 
# 			myisamchk for access to the tables.
#
# 			The same is true for use of myisampack to pack MyISAM tables.
#
# 			If the server is run with external locking enabled, you can use myisamchk at any time for read operations
# 			such as checking tables.
#
# 			In this case, if the server tries to update a table that myisamchk is using, the server will wait for myisamchk to finish
# 			before it continues.
#
# 			If you use myisamchk for write operations such as repairing or optimizing tables, or if you use myisampack to pack tables,
# 			you must always ensure that hte mysqld server is not using the table.
#
# 			If you do not stop mysqld, at least do a mysqladmin flush-tables before you run myisamchk.
#
# 			Your tables MAY BECOME CORRUPTED if the server and myisamchk access the tables simultaneously.
#
# With external locking in effect, each process that requires access to a table acquires a file system lock
# for the table files before proceeding to access the table.
#
# If all necessary locks cannot be acquired, the process is blocked from accessing the table until the locks
# can be obtained (after the process that currently holds the locks release them)
#
# Exernal locking affects server performance because the server must sometimes wait for other proceses before it can
# access tables.
#
# External locking is unecessary if you run a single server to access a given data directory (which is the usual case),
# and if no other programs such as mysaicmhk need to modify tables while the server is running.
#
# If you only READ tables with other programs, external locking is not required, although myisamchk might report warnings
# if the server changes tables while myisamchk is reading them.
#
# With external locking disabled, to use myisamchk, you must either stop the server while myisamchk or else lock and
# flush the tables before running myisamchk.
#
# (SEe SYSTEM FACTORS, later)
#
# To avoid this requirement, use the CHECK_TABLE and REPAIR_TABLE staements to check and repair myISAM tables.
#
# For mysqld, external locking is controlled by the value of the skip_external_locking system variable.
#
# When this variable is enabled, external locking is disabled and vice versa.
#
# External locking is disabled by default.
#
# Use of external locking can be controlled at server startup by using the --external-locking or --skip-external-locking option.
#
# If you do use external locking option to enable updates to MyISAM tables from many MySQL processes,
# do not start the server with the --delay-key-write=ALL option or use the DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1 table option
# for any shared tables.
#
# Otherwise, index corruption can occur.
#
# The easiest way to satisfy this condition is to always use --external-locking together with --delay-key-write=OFF.
# (This is not done by default because in many setups it is useful to have a mixture of the preceding options)
#
# OPTIMIZING THE MYSQL SERVER
#
# This section discusses optimization techniques for the database server, primarily dealing with
# system configuration rather than tuning SQL statements.
#
# The information in this section is appropriate for DBAs who want ot ensure perofrmance and scalability
# across the servers they manage; for devs constructing installation scripts that include setting up
# the DB.
#
# And people running MySQL themselves for development, testing and so on, who want to mqximize their own productivity.
#
# OPTIMIZING DISK I/O
#
# This section describes ways to configure storage devices when you can devote more and faster storage hardware to the DB server.
#   
# For information about optimizing an InnoDB configuration to improve I/O performance, see OPTIMIZING INNODB DISK I/O
#
#	 ) Disk seeks are a huge performance bottleneck.
# 
# 		This problem becomes more apparent when the amount of data starts to grow so large that effective caching
# 		becomes impossible.
#
# 		For large DBs where you access mroe or less randomly,m you can be sure that oyu need at least one disk seek
# 		to read and a couple of disk seeks to write things.
#
# 		To minimize this problem, use disks with low seek times.
#
# 	) iNcrease the number of available disk spindles (and thereby reduce the seek overhead) by either symlinking files to different
# 		disks or striping the disks:
#
# 			) Using symbolic links
#
# 				This means that, for MyISAM tables, you symlink the index file and data files from their usual location
# 				in teh data directory to another disk (that may also be striped)
#
# 				This makes both the seek and read times better, assuming that hte disk is not used for otherp urposes as well.
#
# 				See more, under USING SYMBOLIC LINKS, later.
#
# 				Symbolic links are not supported for use with InnoDB tables. However, it is possible to place InnoDB
# 				data and log files on different physical disks.
#
# 				For more information, see OPTIMIZING INNODB DISK I/O, earlier.
#
# 			) Striping
#
# 				Striping means that you have many disks and put the first block on the first disk, second block on the second disk,
# 				and the N-th block on the N-th disk (N % number_of_disks) disk, and so on.
#
# 				This means if your normal data size is less than the stripe size (or pefectly aligned), you get much better performance.
#
# 				Striping is very dependant on operating system and the stripe size, so benchmark your application with different stripe sizes.
#
# 				See USING YOUR OWN BENCHMARKS later.
#
# 				The speed difference for striping is very dependant on the parameters.
#
# 				Depending on how you set the striping parameters and number of disks, you may get
# 				differences measured in orders of magnitude.
#
# 				You have to choose to optimize for random or sequential access.
#
# 		) For reliability, you may want to use RAID 0+1 (striping plus mirroring), but in this case, you need 2 x N drives
# 			of data.
#
# 			This is probably the best option if you have the money for it.
#
# 			However, you may get some volume-management software to handle it effectively.
#
# 		) A good option is to vary the RAID level according to how critical a type of data is.
#
# 			For example, store semi-important data that can be regenerated on a RAID 0 disk, but
# 			store really important data such as host information and logs on a RAID 0+1 or RAID N disk.
#
# 			RAID N can be a problem if you have many writes, due to the time required to update the parity bits.
#
# 		) You can also set the parameters for the file system that the database uses:
#
# 			If you do not need to know when files were last accessed (which is not really useful on a database server),
# 			you can mount your file systems with the -o noatime option.
#
# 			That skips updates to the last access time in inodes on the file system, which avoids some disk seeks.
#
# 			On many operating systems, you can set a file system to be updated asynchronously by mounting it with
# 			the -o async option.
#
# 			If  your computer is reasonably stable, this should give you better performance without sacrificing too much
# 			reliability (This flag is on by default on Linux)
#
# USING NFS WITH MYSQL
#
# Caution is advised when considering using NFS with MySQL. Potential issues, which vary by operating system and NFS
# version, include:
#
# 		) MySQL data and log files placed on NFS volumes becoming locked and unavailable for use.
#
# 			Locking issues may occur in cases where multiple instances of MySQL access the same data directory or where
# 			MySQL is shut down improperly due to a power outage, for example.
#
# 			NFS version 4 addresses underlying locking issues with the introduction of advisory and lease-based locking.
# 			However, sharing a data directory among MySQL instances is not recommended.
#
# 		) Data inconsistencies introduced due to messages received out of order or lost network traffic.
#
# 			To avoid this issue, use TCP with hard and intr mount options.
#
# 		) Maximum file size limitations. NFS Version 2 clients can only access the lowest 2GB of a file (signed 32 bit offset).
# 			NFS version 3 clients support larger files (up to 64 bit offsets). 
#
# 			The maximum supported file size also depends on the local file system of the NFS server.
#
# Using NFS within a professional SAN environment or other storage system tends to offer greater reliability
# than using NFS outside of such an environment.
#
# However, NFS within a SAN environment may be slower than directly attached or bus-attached non-rotational storage.
#
# If you choose to use NFS, NFS Version 4 or later is recommended, as is testing your NFS setup
# thoroughly before deploying into a production environment.
#
# USING SYMBOLIC LINKS
#
# You can move databases or tables from the database directory to other locations and replace them with
# symbolic links to the new locations.
#
# You might want to do this, for example, to move a database to a file system with more free space or increase
# the speed of your system by spreading your tables to different disks.
#
# For InnoDB tables, using the DATA DIRECTORY clause on the CREATE_TABLE statement instead of symbolic links,
# as explained in CREATING A TABLESPACE OUTSIDE OF THE DATA DIRECTORY.
#
# This new feature is a supported, cross-platform technique.
#
# The recommended way to do this is to symlink entire database directories to a different disk.
#
# Symlink MyISAM tables only as a last resort only.
#
# To determine the location of your data directory, use this statement:
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLE LIKE 'datadir';
#
# USING SYMBOLIC LINKS FOR DATABASES ON UNIX
#
# On Unix, the way to symlink a database is first to create a directory on some disk where
# you have free space and then to create a soft link to it from the MySQL data directory.
#
# 		mkdir /dr1/databases/test
# 		ln -s /dr1/databases/test /path/to/datadir
#
# MySQL does not support linking one directory to multiple databases.
#
# Replacing a database directory with a symbolic link works as long as you do not make a symbolic link
# between databases.
#
# Suppose that you have a database db1 under the MySQL data directory, and then make a symlink db2 that
# points to db1:
#
# 		cd /path/to/datadir
# 		ln -s db1 db2
#
# The result is that, for any table tbl_a in db1, there also appears to be a table tbl_a in db2.
#
# If one client updates db1.tbl_a and another client updates db2.tbl_a, problems may occur.
#
# USING SYMBOLIC LINKS FOR MYISAM TABLES ON UNIX
#
# Note:
#
# 		Symbolic link supports as described here, along with the --symbolic-links option that controls it,
# 		is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of MySQL.
#
# 		In addition, the option is disabled by default.
#
# Symlinks are fully supported only for MyISAM tables.
#
# For files used by tables for other storage engines, you may get strange problems if you try to use
# symbolic links.
#
# For InnoDB tables, use the alternative technique explained in CREATING A TABLESPACE OUTSIDE OF THE DATA DIRECTORY instead.
#
# Do not use symlink tables on systems that do not have a fully operational realpath() call.
# (Linux and Solaris support realpath())
#
# To determine whether your system supports symbolic links, check the value of the have_symlink system variable
# using this statement:
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_symlink';
#
# The handling of symbolic links for MyISAM tables works as follows:
#
# 		) In the data directory, you always have the data (.MYD) file and the index (.MYI) file.
# 			The data file and index file can be moved elsewhere and replaced in the data directory by symlinks.
#
# 		) You can symlink the data file and the index file independently to different directories.
#
# 		) To instruct a running MySQL server to perform the symlinking, use the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY
# 			options to CREATE_TABLE.
#
# 			See CREATE TABLE SYNTAX later.
#
# 			Alternatively, if mysqld is not running, symlinking can be accomplished manually using ln -s from the cmd line.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				The path used with either or both of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options may not include the
# 				MySQL data directory. (Bug #32167)
#
# 		) myisamchk does not replace a symlink with the data file or index file.
#
# 			It works directly on the file to which the symlink points.
#
# 			Any temporary files are created in the directory where the data file or index file is located.
#
# 			The same is true for the ALTER_TABLE, OPTIMIZE_TABLE and REPAIR_TABLE statements.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				When you drop a table that is using symlinks, both the symlink and the file to which the symlink points are dropped.
# 				This is an extremely good reason not to run mysqld as the system root or permit system users to have write access
# 				to the MySQL database directories.
#
# 		) If you rename a table with ALTER_TABLE_---_RENAME or RENAME_TABLE and you do not move the table to anotehr database,
# 		the symlinks in the database directory are renamed to teh new names and teh data file and index file are renamed accordingly.
#
# 		) If you use ALTER_TABLE_---_RENAME or RENAME_TABLE to move a table to another database, the table is moved to the other
# 			database directory.
#
# 			If the table name changed, the symlinks in the new database directory are renamed to the new names and the data file
# 			and index files are renamed accordingly.
#
# 		) If you are not using symlinks, start mysqld with the --skip-symbolic-links option to ensure that no one can use
# 			mysqld to drop or rename a file outside of the data directory.
#
# These table symlink operations are not supported:
#
# 		) ALTER_TABLE ignores the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY table options.
#
# USING SYMBOLIC LINKS FOR DATABASES ON WINDOWS
#
# On Windows, symbolic links can be used for database directories.
#
# This enables you to put a database directory at a different location (for example,
# on a different disk) by setting up a symbolic link to it.
#
# Use of database symlinks on Windows is similar to their use on Unix, although the procedure
# for setting up the link differs.
#
# Suppose that you want to place the database directory for a database named mydb at D:\data\mydb
#
# To do this, create a symbolic link in the MySQL data directory that points to D:\data\mydb
#
# However, before creating the symbolic link, make sure that the D:\data\mydb directory exists
# by creating it if necessary.
#
# If you already have a database directory named mydb in the data directory, move it to D:\data
#
# Otherwise, the symbolic link will be ineffective.
#
# To avoid problems, make sure that hte server is not running when you move teh database directory.
#
# On Windows, you can create a symlink using the mklink command. This command requires admin privs.
#
# 1. Change location into the data directory:
#
# 			cd \path\to\datadir
#
# 2. In the data directory, create a symlink named mydb that points to the location of the database directory:
#
# 			mklink /d mydb D:\data\mydb
#
# After this, all tables created in teh database mydb are created in D:\data\mydb
#
# OPTIMIZING MEMORY USAGE
#
# HOW MYSQL USES MEMORY
#
# MySQL allocates buffers and caches to improve performance of database operations.
#
# The default configuration is designed to permit a MySQL server to start on a virtual machine
# that has approx 512 MB of RAM.
#
# You can improve MySQLs performance by increasing the values of certain cache and buffer-related
# system variables.
#
# You can also modify the default configuration to run MySQL on systems with limited memory.
#
# The following list describes some of the ways that MySQL uses memory. Where applicable, relevant
# system variables are referenced.
#
# Some items are storage engine or feature specific.
#
# 		) The InnoDB buffer pool is a memory area that holds cached InnoDB data for tables, indexes, and other
# 			auxiliary buffers.
#
# 			For efficiency of high-volume read operations, the buffer pool is divided into pages that can
# 			potentially hold multiple rows.
#
# 			For efficiency of cache management, the buffer pool is implemented as a linked list of pages;
# 			Data that is rarely used is aged out of the cache, using a variation of the LRU algorithm.
#
# 			For more info on this, see later under BUFFER POOL.
#
# 			The size of the buffer pool is important for system performance:
#
# 				) InnoDB allocates memory for the entire buffer pool at server startup, using malloc() operations.
#
# 					The innodb_buffer_pool_size system variable defines the buffer pool size.
#
# 					Typically, a recommended innodb_buffer_pool_size value is 50 to 75 percent of system memory.
#
# 					innodb_buffer_pool_size can be configured dynamically, while the server is running.
#
# 					For more information, see CONFIGURING INNODB BUFFER POOL SIZE
#
# 				) On systems with a large amount of memory, you can improve concurrency by dividing the buffer
# 					into multiple buffer pool instances.
#
# 					The innodb_buffer_pool_instances system variable defines the number of buffer pool instances.
#
# 				) A buffer pool that is too small may cause excessive churning as pages are flushed from the buffer pool
# 					only to be required again a short itme later.
#
# 				) A buffer pool that is too large may cause swapping due to competition for memory.
#
# 		) The storage engine interface enables the optimizer to provide information about the size of the
# 			record buffer to be used for scans that the optimizer estimates will read multiple rows.
#
# 			The buffer size can vary based on the size of the estimate.
#
# 			InnoDB uses this variable-size buffering capability to take advantage of row prefetching,
# 			and to reduce the overhead of latching and B-tree navigation.
#
# 		) All threads share the MyISAM key buffer. The key_buffer_size system variable determines its size.
#
# 			For each MyISAM table the server opens, the index file is opened once; the data file is opened
# 			once for each concurrently running thread that accesses the table.
#
# 			For each concurrent thread, a table structure, column structures for each column, and a buffer size
# 			of size 3 * N are allocated (where N is the maximum row length, not counting BLOB columns)
#
# 			A BLOB column requires five to eight bytes plus the length of the BLOB data.
#
# 			The MyISAM storage engine maintains one extra row buffer for internal use.
#
# 		) The myisam use mmap system variable can be set to 1 to enable memory-mapping for all MyISAM tables
#
# 		) If an internal in-memory temporary table becomes too large (as determined using the tmp_table_size and
# 			max_heap_table_size system variables), MySQL automatically converts the table from in-memory
# 			to on-disk format.
#
# 			On-disk temporary tables use the storage engine defined by the internal tmp disk storage engine system
# 			variable.
#
# 			You can increase the permissible temporary table size as described in INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLE USE IN MYSQL
#
# 			For MEMORY tables explicitly created with CREATE_TABLE, only the max_heap_table_size system variables determines
# 			how large a table can grow, and there is no conversion to on-disk format.
#
# 		) The MySQL Performance Schema is a feature for monitoring MySQL server execution at a low level.
#
# 			The Performance Schema dynamically allocates memory incrementally, scaling its memory use to actual server load,
# 			instead of allocating required memory during server startup.
#
# 			Once memory is allocated, it is not freed until the server is restarted.
#
# 			For more information, see THE PERFORMANCE SCHEMA MEMORY-ALLOCATION MODEL
#
# 		) Each thread that hte server uses to manage client connections requires some thread-specific space.
#
# 			The following list indicates these and which system variables control their size:
#
# 				) A stack (Thread stack)
#
# 				) A connection buffer (net buffer length)
#
# 				) A result buffer (net buffer length)
#
# 			The connection buffer and result buffer each begin with a size equal to net_buffer_length bytes,
# 			but are dynamically enlarged up to max_allowed_packet byte as needed.
#
# 			The result buffer shrinks to net_buffer_length bytes after each SQL statement.
#
# 			While a statement is running, a copy of the current statement string is also allocated.
#
# 			Each connection thread uses memory for computing statement digests.
#
# 			The server allocates max_digest_length bytes per session.
#
# 			See PERFORMANCE SCHEMA STATEMENT DIGEST AND SAMPLING later, for more info.
#
# 		) All threads share the same base memory.
#
# 		) When a thread is no longer needed, the memory allocated to it is released and returned
# 			to the system unless the thread goes back into the thread cache.
#
# 			IN that case, the memory remains allocated.
#
# 		) Each request that performs a sequential scan of a table allocates a read buffer. The read_buffer_size
# 			System variable determines the buffer size.
#
# 		) When reading rows in an arbitrary sequence (for example, following a sort), a random-read buffer may be
# 			allocated to avoid disk seeks.
#
# 			The read_rnd_buffer_size system variable determines the buffer size.
#
# 		) All joins are executed in a single pass, and most joins can be done without even using a temporary table.
#
# 			Most temporary tables are memory-based hash tables.
#
# 			Temporary tables with a large row length (calculated as the sum of all column lengths) or that contain BLOB
# 			columns are stored on disk.
#
# 		) Most requests that perform a sort allocate a sort buffer and zero to two temporary files depending on
# 			the result size.
#
# 			WHERE MYSQL STORES TEMPORARY FILES
#
# 		) ALmost all parsing and calculating is done in thread-local and reusable memory pools.
#
# 			No memory overhead is needed for small items, thus avoiding the normal slow memory allocation
# 			and freeing.
#
# 			Memory is allocated only for unexpected large strings.
#
# 		) For each table having BLOB columns, a buffer is enlarged dynamically to read in larger BLOB
# 			values.
#
# 			If you scan a table, the buffer grows as large as the largest BLOB value.
#
# 		) MySQL requires memory and descriptors for the table cache.
#
# 			Handle structures for all in-use tables are saved in the table cache and managed
# 			as "First in, First out" (FIFO)
#
# 			The table_open_cache system variable defines the intial table cache size. See HOW MYSQL OPENS AND CLOSES TABLES.
#
# 			MySQL also requires memory for the table definition cache. The table_definition_cache system variables defines
# 			the number of  table definitions that can be stored in teh table definition cache.
#
# 			If you use a large number of tables, you can create a large table definition cache to speed up
# 			the opening of tables.
#
# 			The table definition cache takes less space and does not use file descriptors, unlike the table cache.
#
# 		) A FLUSH_TABLES statement or mysqladmin flush-tables command closes all tables that are not in use at once
# 			and marks all in-use tables to be closed when the currently executing thread finishes.
#
# 			This effectively frees most in-use memory.
#
# 			FLUSH_TABLES does not return until all tables have been closed.
#
# 		) The server caches information in memory as a result of GRANT, CREATE_USER, CREATE_SERVER and INSTALL_PLUGIN
# 			statements.
#
# 			This memory is not released by the corresponding REVOKE, DROP_USER, DROP_SERVER and UNINSTALL PLUGIN statements,
# 			so for a server that executes many instances of the statements that cause caching, there will be an increase
# 			in memory use.
#
# 			This cached memory can be freed with FLUSH_PRIVILEGES.
#
# 		) In a replication topology, the following settings affect memory usage, and can be adjusted as required:
#
# 				) The max_allowed_packet system variable on a replication master limits the maxium message size that
# 					the master sends to its slaves for processing.
#
# 					This setting defaults to 64M.
#
# 				) The slave_pending_jobs_size_max system variable on a multi-threaded slave sets the maximum amount of memory
# 					that is made available for holding messages awaiting processing.
#
# 					This setting defaults to 128M.
#
# 					The memory is only allocated when needed, but it might be used if your replication topology handles
# 					large transactions sometimes.
#
# 					It is a soft limit, and larger transactions can be processed.
#
# 				) The rpl_read_size system variable on a replication master or slave controls the minimum amount of data in
# 					bytes that is read from the binary log files and relay log files.
#
# 					THe default is 8192 bytes. A buffer the size of this value is allocated for each thread
# 					that reads from the binary log and relay log files, including dump threads on masters
# 					and coordinator threads on slaves.
#
# 				) THe binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size system variable limits the number of rows hashes
# 					held as in-memory history.
#
# 				) The max_binlog_cache_Size system variable specifies the upper limit of memory usage by an individual transaction.
#
# 				) The max_binlog_stmt_cache_size system variable specifies the upper limit of memory usage by the statement cache.
#
# ps and other system status programs may report that mysqld uses a lot of memory.
#
# THis may be caused by thread stacks on differnet memory addresses.
# For example, the Solaris version of ps counts the unused memory between stacks as used memory.
#
# To verify this, check available swap with swap -s. We test mysqld with several memory-leakage
# detectors (both commercial/open source),so there should not be any memory leaks.
#
# MONITORING MYSQL MEMORY USAGE
#
# The following example demonstrates how ot use Performance SChema and Sys schema to monitor MySQL memory usage.
#
# Most Performance Schema memory instrumentation is disabled by default.
#
# Instruments can be enabled by updating the ENABLED column of the Performance Schema
# setup_instruments table.
#
# Memory instruments have names in teh form of memory/code_area/instrument_name, where code_area
# is a value such as sql or innodb, and instrument_name is the instrument detail.
#
# 1. To view available MySQL memory instruments, query the Performance Schema setup_instruments table.
#
# 		The following query returns hundreds of memory instruments for all code areas:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
# 			WHERE NAME LIKE '%memory%';
#
# 		YOu can narrow results by specifying a code area. For example, you can limit results to InnoDB
# 		memory instruments by specifying innodb as the code area.
#
# 			SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
# 			WHERE NAME LIKE '%memory/innodb%';
# 			+---------------------------------------------------+------------+---------+
# 			| NAME 															 | ENABLED 	  | TIMED   |
# 			+---------------------------------------------------+------------+---------+
# 			| memory/innodb/adaptive_hash_index 					 | NO 		  | NO 	   |
# 			| memory/innodb/buf_buf_pool 								 | NO 		  | NO      |
# 		   | memory/innodb/dict_stats_bg_recalc_pool_t 			 | NO 		  | NO 	   |
# 			| memory/innodb/dict_stats_index_map_t 				 | NO 		  | NO 	   |
# 			| memory/innodb/dict_stats_n_diff_on_level 			 | NO 		  | NO 		|
# 			| memory/innodb/other 										 | NO 		  | NO 	   |
# 			| memory/innodb/row_log_buf 								 | NO 		  | NO 	   |
# 			| memory/innodb/row_merge_sort 							 | NO 		  | NO 	   |
# 			| memory/innodb/std 											 | NO 		  | NO      |
# 			| memory/innodb/trx_sys_t::rw_trx_ids 				    | NO 		  | NO 	   |
# 			---
#
# Depending on your MySQL installation, code areas may include performance_schema, sql, client,
# innodb, myisam, csv, memory, blackhole, archive, partition and others.
#
# 2. To enable memory instruments, add a performance-schema-instrument rule to your MySQL configuration
# 		file.
#
# 		For example, to enable all memory instruments, add this rule to your configuration file and restart
# 		the server:
#
# 			performance-schema-instrument='memory/%=COUNTED'
#
# 		NOTE:
#
# 			Enabling memory instruments at startup ensures that memory allocations that occur at startup are counted.
#
# 		After restarting the server, the ENABLED column of the Performance Schema setup_instruments

#
# ENABLING LARGE PAGE SUPPORT
#
# Some hardware/operating systme architechture support memory pages greater than the default (usually 4kb).
# The actual implementation of this support depends on the underlying hardware and operating system.
#
# Applications that perform a lot of memory accesses may obtain performance improvements by using large
# pages due to redued Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) misses.
#
# In MySQL, large pages can be used by InnoDB, to allocate memory for its buffer pool and additional memory pool.
#
# Standard use of large pages in MySQL attempts to use the largest size supported, up to 4MB.
#
# Under Solaris, a "super large pages" feature enables uses of pages up to 256MB.
#
# THis feature is available for recent SPARC platforms. It can be enabled or disabled by
# using the --super-large-pages or --skip-super-large-pages option.
#
# MySQL also supports the Linux implementation of large page support (which is called HugeTLB in Linux)
#
# Before large pages can be used on Linux, the kernel must be enabled to support them and it is necessary
# to configure the HugeTLB memory pool.
#
# For reference, the HugeTLB API is documented in teh Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt file of your Linux sources.
#
# The kernel for some recent systems such as Read Hat Enterprises Linux appear to have the large pages
# feature enabled by default.
#
# TO check whether this is true for your kernel, use the following command and look for output lines containing "Huge".
#
# 		cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i huge
# 		HugePages_Total: 		0
# 		HugePages_Free: 		0
# 		HugePages_Rsvd: 		0
# 		HugePages_Surp: 		0
# 		Hugepagesize: 		4096 kb
#
# The nonempty command output indicates that large page support is present, but the zero values indicate
# that no pages are configured for use.
#
# If your kernel needs to be reconfigured to support large pages, consult the hugetlbpage.txt file for instructions.
#
# Assuming that your Linux kernel has large page support enabled, configure it for use by MySQL using the following commands.
#
# Normally, you put these in an rc file or equivalent startup file that is executed during the system boot sequence,
# so that hte commands execute each time the system starts.
#
# The commands should execute early in the boot sequence, before the MySQL server starts.
#
# Be sure to change the allocation numbers and the group number as appropriate for your system.
#
# 		# Set the number of pages to be used.
# 		# Each page is normally 2MB, so a value of 20 = 40MB.
# 		# This command actually allocates memory, so this much
# 		# memory must be avaialable.
# 		echo 20 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
#
# 		# Set the group number that is permitted to access this
# 		# memory (102 in this case). The mysql user must be a member of this group.
# 		echo 102 > /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group
#
# 		# INcrease the amount of shmem permitted per segment
# 		# (12G in this case)
# 		echo 1560281088 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
#
# 		# Increase total amount of shared memory. The value
# 		# is the number of pages. At 4kb/page, 4194304 = 16GB
# 		echo 4194304 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
#
# For MySQL usage, you normally want the value of shmmax to be close to the value of shmall.
#
# To verify the large page configuration, check /proc/meminfo again as described previously.
# Now you should see some nonzero values:
#
# 		cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i huge
# 		HugePages_Total: 		20
# 		HugePages_Free: 		20
# 		HugePages_Rsvd: 		 0
# 		HugePages_Surp: 	 	 0
# 		Hugepagesize: 		 4096 kB
#
# THe final step to make use of the hugetlb_shm_group is to give the mysql user an "unlimited" value for the
# memlock limit.
#
# This can be done either by editing /etc/security/limits.conf or by adding the following command to your
# mysqld_safe script:
#
# 		ulimit -1 unlimited
#
# Adding the ulimit command to mysqld_safe causes the root user to set the memlock limit to unlimited
# before switching to the mysql user.
#
# (This assumes that mysqld_safe is started by root)
#
# large page support in MySQL is disabled by default.
# To enable it, start the server with the --large-pages option.
#
# For example, you can use the following lines in the server my.cnf file:
#
# 		[mysqld]
# 		large-pages
#
# With this option, InnoDB uses large pages automatically for its buffer pool and additional memory pool.
#
# If InnoDB cannot do this, it falls back to use of traditional memory and writes a warning to the
# error log: Warning : Using conventional memory pool
#
# To verify that large pages are being used, check /proc/meminfo again:
#
# 		cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i huge
# 		HugePages_Total: 			20
# 		HugePages_Free: 			20
# 		HugePages_Rsvd: 			 2
# 		HugePages_Surp: 			 0
# 		Hugepagesize: 	 		 4096 kB

# OPTIMIZING NETWORK USE
#
# HOW MYSQL HANDLES CLIENT CONNECTIONS
#
# THis section describes aspects of how the MySQL server manages client connections.
#
# 		) Network Interfaces and Connection Manager Threads
#
# 		) Client Connection Thread Management
#
# 		) Connection Volume Management
#
# 		) Administrative Connection Management
#
# NETWORK INTERFACES AND CONNECTION MANAGER THREADS
#
# The server is capable of listening for client connections on multiple network interfaces.
#
# Connection manager threads handle client connection requests on the network interfaces
# that the server listens to:
#
# 		) On all platforms, one manager thread handles TCP/IP connection requests
#
# 		) On Unix, the same manager thread also handles Unix socket file connection requests
#
# 		) On Windows, a manager thread handles shared-memory connection requests, and another handles named-pipe connection requests.
#
# 		) On all platforms, an additional network interface may be enabled to accept administrative TCP/IP connection requests.
#
# 			This interface can use the manager thread that handles "ordinary" TCP/IP requests, or a separate thread.
#
# The server does not create threads to handle interfaces that it does not listen to.
#
# For example, a Windows Server that does not have support for named-pipe connections
# enabled does not create a thread to handle them.
#
# CLIENT CONNECTION THREAD MANAGEMENT
#
# Connection manager threads associate each client connection with a thread dedicated to it that handles
# authentication and request processing for that connection.
#
# Manager threads create a new thread when necessary but try to avoid doing so by consulting the thread cache
# first to see whether it contains a thread that can be used for the connection.
#
# When a connection ends, its thread is returned ot the thread cache if the cache is not full.
#
# In this connection thread model, there are as many threads as there are clients currently connected, which has some
# disadvantages when server workload must scale to handle large numbers of connections.
#
# For example, thread creation and disposal becomes expensive. Also, each thread requires server and kernel resources,
# such as stack space.
#
# To accommodate a large number of simultaneous connections, the stack size per thread must be kept small, leading to
# a situation where it is either too small or the server consumes large amounts of memory.
#
# Exhaustion of other resources can occur as well, and scheduling overhead can become significant.
#
# MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a thread pool plugin that provides an alternative thread-handling model designed to
# reduce overhead and improve performance.
#
# It implements a thread pool taht increases server performance by efficiently managing statement execution threads
# for large numbers of client connections.
#
# See MYSQL ENTERPRISE THREAD POOL for more info.
#
# To control and monitor how the server manages threads that handle client connections, several system and
# status variables are relevant.
#
# See SERVER SYSTEM VARIABLES and SERVER STATUS VARIABLES, for more info.
#
# The thread_cache_size system variable determines the thread cache size.
#
# By default, the server autosizes the value at startup, but it can be set explicitly
# to override this default.
#
# A value of 0 disables caching, which causes a thread to be set up for each new connection
# and disposed of when the connection terminates.
#
# To enable N inactive connection threads to be cached, set thread_cache_size to N at server
# startup or at runtime.
#
# A connection thread becomes inactive when the client connection with which it was associated terminates.
#
# To monitor the number of threads in the cache and how many threads have been created because a thread
# could not be taken from the cache, check the Threads_cached and Threads_created status variables.
#
# When the thread stack is too small, this limits the complexity of the SQL statements which the server
# can handle, the recursion depth of stored procedures, and other memory-consuming actions.
#
# To set a stack size of N bytes for each thread, start the server with thread_stack set to N at server startup.
#
# CONNECTION VOLUME MANAGEMENT
#
# To control the maximum number of clients the server permits to connect simultaneously, set the
# max_connections system variable at server startup or at runtime.
#
# It may be necessary to increase max_connections if more clients attempt to connect simultaneously
# then the server is configured to handle.
#
# See TOO MANY CONNECTIONS, SECTION B.5.2.6 later for more info.
#
# Mysqld actually permits max_connections + 1 client connections.
#
# The extra connection is reserved for use by accounts that have the CONNECTION_ADMIN
# or SUPER privilege.
#
# BY granting the privilege to admins and not to normal users (who should not need it),
# an admin can connect to the server and use SHOW_PROCESSLIST to diagnose problems even
# if the maximum number of unprivileged clients are connected.
#
# See SHOW PROCESSLIST SYNTAX for more info, later.
#
# (The server also permits administrative connections on a dedicated interface. See ADMINISTRATIVE CONNECTION MANAGEMENT)
#
# If the server refuses a connection because the max_connections limit is reached, it increments the
# Connection_errors_max_connections status variable.
#
# The maximum number of connections MySQL supports (that is, the maximum value to which max_connections can be set)
# depends on several factors:
#
# 		) The quality of the thread library on a given platform
#
# 		) The amount of RAM available
#
# 		) The amount of RAM is used for each connection
#
# 		) The workload from each connection
#
# 		) The desired response time
#
# 		) The number of file descriptors available
#
# Linux or Solaris should be able to support at least 500 to 1000 simultaneous connections routinely
# and as many as 10,000 connections if you have many gigabytes of RAM available and the workload
# from each is low or the response time target undemanding.
#
# Increasing the max_connections value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires.
#
# IF the required number of descriptors are not available, the server reduces the value
# of max_connections.
#
# For comments on file descriptor limits, see HOW MYSQL OPENS AND CLOSES TABLES, for more info.
#
# Increasing --open-files-limit may be necessary, which may also require raising the operating system
# limit on how many file descriptors can be used by MySQL.
#
# Consult your operating system documentation to determine whether it is possible to increase the limit
# and how to do so.
#
# See SECTION B.5.2.17, "FILE NOT FOUND AND SIMILAR ERRORS" for more information.
#
# ADMINISTRATIVE CONNECTION MANAGEMENT
#
# As of MySQL 8.0.14, the server permits a TCP/IP port to be configured specifically
# for administrative connections.
#
# This provides an alternative to the single administrative connection that is permitted
# on the network interfaces used for ordinary connections even when max_connections connections
# are already established.
#
# See CONNECTION VOLUME MANAGEMENT
#
# The administrative network interface has these characteristics:
#
# 		) The interfaceis available only if the admin_address system variable is set at startup to indicate
# 			the IP address for the administrative interface.
#
# 			If no admin_address value is specified, the server maintains no administrative interface.
#
# 		) The admin_port system varaible specifies the interface TCP/IP port number (default 33062)
#
# 		) There is no limit on the number of administrative connections
#
# 		) Connections are permitted only by users who have the SERVICE_CONNECTION_ADMIN privilege.
#
# The create_admin_listener_thread system variable enables DBAs to choose at startup whether the administrative
# interface is implemented using the listener thread used for ordinary connections, or has its own separate thread.
#
# The default is to implement the administrative interface using the listener thread used for ordinary
# connections.
#
# DNS LOOKUP OPTIMIZATION AND THE HOST CACHE
#
# The MySQL server maintains a host cache in memory that contains information about clients: IP address,
# host name, and error information.
#
# The Performance Schema host_cache table exposes the contents of the host cache so that it can be examined
# using SELECT statements.
#
# This may help you diagnose the cuase of connection problems.
#
# See THE HOST_CACHE TABLE for more info, later.
#
# Note:
#
# 		The server uses the host cache only for nonlocal TCP connections.
#
# 		IT does not use the cache for TCP connections established using a loopback interface
# 		address (for example, 127.0.0.1 or ::1) or for connections established using a Unix socket
# 		file, named pipe or shared memory.
#
# HOST CACHE OPERATION
#
# The server uses the host cache for several purposes:
#
# 		) By caching the results of IP-to-host name lookups, the server avoids doing a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup
# 			for each client connection.
#
# 			Instead, for a given host, it needs to perform a lookup only for the first connection from that host.
#
# 		) The cache contains information about errors that occur during the connection process.
#
# 			Some errors are considered "blocking". If too many of these occur successively from a given host
# 			without a successful connection, the server blocks further connections from that host.
#
# 			The max_connect_errors system variable determines the permitted number of successive errors before
# 			blocking occurs.
#
# 			See HOST 'HOST_NAME' IS BLOCKED SECTION B.5.2.5 later for more info.
#
# For each new client connection, the server uses the client IP address to check whether the client host name
# is in the host cache.
#
# If so, the server refuses or continues to process the connection request depending on whether or not
# the host is blocked.
#
# If the host is not in the cache, the server attempts to resolve the host name.
#
# First, it resolves the IP address to a host name and resolves that host name back to an IP address.
#
# Then it compares the result to the original IP address to ensure that they are the same.
#
# The server stores information about the result of this operation in teh host cache.
# If the cache is full, the least recently used entry is discarded.
#
# The server handles entries in the host cache like this:
#
# 		1. When the first TCP client connection reaches the server from a given IP address, a new cache
# 			entry is created to record the client IP, host name and client lookup validation flag.
#
# 			Initially, the host name is set ot NULL and the flag is false.
#
# 			This entry is also used for subsequent client TCP connections from the same original IP.
#
# 		2. If the validation flag for the client IP entry is false, the server attempts an IP-to-host name-to-IP DNS
# 			resolution.
#
# 			If thati s successful, the host name is updated with the resolved host name and the validation flag is set to true.
#
# 			If resolution is unsuccessful, the action taken depends on whether the error is permanent or transient.
# 			For permanent failures, the host name remains NULL and the validation flag is set to true.
#
# 			For transient failures, the host name and validation flag remain unchanged.
 #			(In this case, another DNS resolution attempt occurs the next time a client connects from this IP)
 #
 # 	3. If an error occurs while processing an incoming client connection from a given IP address, the server 
 # 			updates the corresponding error counters in the entry for that IP.
 #
 # 		For a description of the errors recorded, see SECTION 26.12.17.1 "THE HOST_CACHE TABLE"
 #
 # The server performs host name resolution using the gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname() system cals.
 #
 # To unblock blocked hosts, flush the host cache by executing a FLUSH HOSTS statement, a TRUNCATE_TABLE statement
 # that truncates the Performance Schema host_cache table or a mysqladmin flush-hosts command.
 #
 # FLUSH_HOSTS and mysqladmin flush-hosts require the RELOAD Privilege. TRUNCATE_TABLE requires the DROP privilege
 # for the host_cache table.
 #
 # It is possible for a blocked host to become unblocked even without flushing the host cache if activity from other
 # hosts has occurred since the last connection attempt from the blocked host.
 #
 # This can occur because the server discard the least recently used entry to make room for a new entry if the 
 # cache is full when a connection arrives from a client IP not in the cache.
 #
 # IF the discard entry is for a blocked host, that host becomes unblocked.
 #
 # Some connection errors are not associated with TCP connections, occur very early in the connection process
 # (even ebfore an IP address is known) or are not specific to any particular IP address (such as out-of-memory conditions).
 #
 # For information about these errors, check the Connection_errors_xxx status variables.
 # See SECTION 5.1.10, SERVER STATUS VARIABLES for more information.
 #
 # HOST CACHE CONFIGURATION
 #
 # The host cache is enabled by default.
 #
 # The host_cache_size system variable controls its size, as well as the size of the
 # Performance Schema host_cache table that exposes the cache contents.
 #
 # The cache size can be set at server startup and changed at runtime.
 #
 # For example, to set the size to 100 at startup, put these lines in the server my.cnf
 # file:
 #
 # 		[mysqld]
 # 		host_cache_size=200
 #
 # To change the size to 300 at runtime, do this:
 #
 # 		SET GLOBAL host_cache_size=300;
 #
 # Setting host_cache_size to 0, either at server startup or at runtime, disables the host cache.
 # With the cache disabled, the server performs a DNS lookup every time a client connects.
 #
 # Changing the cache size at runtime causes an implicit FLUSH_HOSTS operation that clears the host cache,
 # truncates the host_cache table, and unblocks any blocked hosts.
 #
 # Using the --skip-host-cache option is similar to setting the host_cache_size system variable to 0, but
 # host_cache_size is more flexible, because it can also be used to resize, enable and disable the host cache at runtime,
 # not just at server startup.
 #
 # Starting the server with --skip-host-cache does not prevent changes to hte value of host_cache_size,
 # but such changes have no effect and the cache is not re-enabled even if host_cache_size is set
 # larger than 0 at runtime.
 #
 # To disable DNS host name lookups, start the server with the --skip-name-resolve option.
 #
 # IN this case, the server uses only IP addresses and not host names to match connecting hosts
 # to rows in the MySQL grant tables.
 #
 # Only accounts specified in those tables using IP addresses can be used.
 #
 # (A client may not be able to connect if no account exists that specifies the client IP address)
 #
 # IF you have a very slow DNS and many hosts, you might be able to improve the performance either by disabling DNS lookups
 # with --skip-name-resolve or by increasing the value of host_cache_size to make the host cache larger.
 #
 # To disallow TCP/IP connections entirely, start the server with the --skip-networking option.
 #
 # RESOURCE GROUPS
 #
 # MySQL supports creation and management of resource groups, and permits assigning threads running
 # within the server to particular groups so that threads execute according to the resources available
 # to the group.
 #
 # Group attributes enable control over its resources, to enable or restrict resource consumption by threads
 # in the group.
 #
 # DBAs can modify these attributes as appropriate for different workloads.
 #
 # Currently, CPU time is a managable resource, reprented by the concept of "virtual CPU" as a term that
 # includes CPU cores, hyperthreads, hardware threads, and so forth.
 #
 # THe server determines at startup how many virtual CPUs are available, and database administrators
 # with appropriate privileges can associate these CPUs with resource groups and assign threads
 # to groups.
 #
 # For example, to manage execution or batch jobs that need not execute with high priority, a DBA can
 # create a Batch resource group, and adjust its priority up or down depending on how busy the server is.
 #
 # (Perhaps batch jobs assigned to the group should run at lower priority during the day and at higher
 # priority during the night)
 #
 # The DBA can also adjust the set of CPUs available to the group. Groups can be enabled or disabled 
 # to control whether threads are assignable to them.
 #
 # The following sections describe aspects of resource group use in MySQL:
 #
 # ) Resource Group COmponents
 #
 # ) Resource Group Attributes
 #
 # ) Resource Group Management 
 #
 # ) Resource Group Replication
 #
 # ) Resource Group Restrictions 
 #
 # IMPORTANT:
 #
 # On some platforms or MySQL server configurations, resource groups are unavailable or have limitations.
 # In particular, Linux systems might require a manual step for some installation methods.
 #
 # For details, see RESOURCE GROUP RESTRICTIONS for more info.
 #
 # RESOURCE GROUP COMPONENTS
 #
 # These capabilities provide the SQL interface for resource group management in MySQL:
 #
 # 	) SQL statements enables creating, altering and dropping resouce groups and enable assigning
 # 		threads to resource groups.
 #
 # 		An optimizer hint enables assigning individual statements to resource groups.
 #
 # 	) Resource group privileges provide control over which users can perform resource group operations.
 #
 # 	) The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESOURCE_GROUPS table exposes information about resource group
 # 		definitions and the Performance Schema threads table shows the resource group assignment for each thread.
 #
 # 	) Status variables provide execution counts for each management SQL statement.
 #
 # RESOURCE GROUP ATTRIBTUES
 #
 # Resource groups have attributes that define the group.
 # All attributes can be set at group creation time.
 #
 # Some attributes are fixed at creation time; others can be modified any time thereafter.
 #
 # These attributes are defined at resource group creation time and cannot be modified:
 #
 # 	) Each group has a name. Resource group names are identifiers like table and column names,
 # 		and need not be quoted in SQL statements unless they contain special characters or are reserved words.
 #
 # 		Group names are not case sensitive and may be up to 64 characters long.
 #
 # 	) Each group has a type, which is either SYSTEM or USER.
 #
 # 		The resource group type affects the range of priority values assignable to the group,
 # 		as described later.
 #
 # 		This attribute together with the differences in permitted priorities enables system
 # 		threads to be identified so as to protect them from contention for CPU resources against
 # 		user threads.
 #
 # 		System and user threads correspond to background and foreground threads as listed in the Performance Schema threads table.
 #
 # These attributes are defined at resource group creation time and can be modified an time thereafter:
 #
 # 	) The CPU affinity is the set of virtual CPUs the resource group can use. An affinity can be any
 # 		nonempty subset of the available CPUs.
 #
 # 		If a group has no affinity, it can use all available CPUs.
 #
 # 	) The thread priority is the execution priority for threads assigned to the resource group.
 # 		Priority values range from -20 (highest prio) to 19 (lowest prio)
 #
 # 		The default prio is 0, forb oth system and user groups.
 #
 # 		System groups are permitted a higher priority than user groups, ensuring that user threads
 # 		never have a higher prio than system threads:
 #
 # 			) For system resource groups, the permitted priority range is -20 to 0.
 #
 # 			) For user resource groups, the permitted priority range is 0 to 19.
 #
 #		) Each group can be enabled or disabled, affording administrators control over thread assignments.
 #
 # 		Threads can be assigned only to enabled groups.
 #
 # RESOURCE GROUP MANAGEMENT

 # By default, there is one system group and one user group, named SYS_default and USR_default, respectively.
 # These default groups cannot be dropped and their attributes cannot be modified.
 #
 # Each default group has no CPU affinity and priority 0.
 #
 # Newly created system and user threads are assigned to the SYS_default and USR_default groups, respectively.
 #
 # For user-defined resource groups, all attributes are assigned at group creation time.
 #
 # After a group has been created, its attributes can be modified, with the exception of the name
 # and typpe attributes.
 #
 # To create and manage user-defined resource groups, use these SQL statements:
 #
 # 	) CREATE_RESOURCE_GROUP creates a new group. See SECTION 13.7.2.2, "CREATE RESOURCE GROUP syntax" for more info.
 #
 # 	) ALTER_RESOURCE_GROUP modifies an existing group. See SECTION 13.7.2.1, "ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Syntax" for more info.
 #
 # 	) DROP_RESOURCE_GROUP drops an existing group. See SECTION 13.7.2.3, "DROP RESOURCE GROUP Syntax" for more info.
 #
 # Those statements require the RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN privilege.
 #
 # To manage resource group assignments, use these capabilities:
 #
 # 	) SET_RESOURCE_GROUP assigns threads to a group. See SECTION 13.7.2.4, "SET RESOURCE GROUP Syntax" for more info.
 #
 # 	) The RESOURCE_GROUP optimizer hints assigns individual statements to a group. See Section 8.9.2, "OPTIMIZER HINTS" for more info.
 #
 # Those operations require the RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN or RESOURCE_GROUP_USER privilege.
 #
 # Resource group definitions are stored in the resource_groups data dictionary table so that
 # groups perssist across server restarts.
 #
 # Because resource_groups is part of the data dictionary, it is not directly accessible by users.
 #
 # Resource group information is available using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESOURCE_GROUPS table,
 # which is implemented as a view on the data dictionary table.
 #
 # See Section 25.21, "THE INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS TABLE" for more info.
 #
 # Initially, the RESOURCE_GROUPS table has these rows describing the default groups:
 #
 # 		SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESOURCE_GROUPS\G
 # 		************************* 1. row **********************
 # 			RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: USR_default
 # 			RESOURCE_GROUP_TYPE: USER
 # 		RESOURCE_GROUP_ENABLED: 1
 # 						VCPU_IDS  : 0-3
 # 				THREAD_PRIORITY : 0
 # 		************************* 2. row **********************
 # 			RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: SYS_default
 # 			RESOURCE_GROUP_TYPE: SYSTEM
 # 		RESOURCE_GROUP_ENABLED: 1
 # 						VCPU_IDS  : 0-3
 # 				THREAD_PRIORITY : 0
 #
 # The THREAD_PRIORITY values are 0, indicating the default priority.
 #
 # The VCPU_IDS values show a range comprising all available CPUs.
 #
 # For the default groups, the displayed value varies depending on the system
 # on which the MySQL server runs.
 #
 # Earlier discussion mentioned a scenario involving a resource group named Batch
 # to manage execution of batch jobs that need not execute with high priority.
 #
 # To create such a group, use a statement similar to this:
 #
 # CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Batch
 # 	TYPE = USER
 # 	VCPU = 2-3 				-- assumes a system with at least 4 CPUs
 # 	THREAD_PRIORITY = 10;
 #
 # To verify that the resource group was created as expected, check the RESOURCE_GROUPS table:
 #
 # 	SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESOURCE_GROUPS WHERE RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = 'Batch'\G
 # 	******************************** 1. row ***********************
 # 		RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: Batch
 # 		RESOURCE_GROUP_TYPE: USER
 # 	RESOURCE_GROUP_ENABLED: 1
 # 					VCPU_IDS  : 2-3
 # 			THREAD_PRIORITY : 10
 #
 # If the THREAD_PRIORITY value is 0 rather than 10, check whether your platform or system configuration
 # limits the resource group capability.
 #
 # See RESOURCE GROUP RESTRICTIONS for more information.
 #
 # To assign a thread to the Batch group, do this:
 #
 # 		SET RESOURCE GROUP Batch FOR thread_id;
 #
 # Thereafter, statements in the named thread execute with Batch group resources.
 #
 # If a session's own current thread should be in the Batch group, execute this statement
 # within the session:
 #
 # 	SET RESOURCE GROUP Batch;
 #
 # Thereafter, statements in the session execute with Batch group resources.
 #
 # To execute a single statement using the Batch group, use the RESOURCE_GROUP optimizer hint:
 #
 # 	INSERT /*+ RESOURCE_GROUP(Batch) */ INTO t2 VALUES(2);
 #
 # Threads assigned to the Batch group execute with its resources, which can be modified as desired:
 #
 # 	) For times when the system is highly loaded, decreases the number of CPUs assigned to the group,
 # 		lower its priority or (as shown) both:
 #
 # 		ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Batch
 # 			VCPU = 3
 # 			THREAD_PRIORITY = 19;
 #
 # 	) For times when the system is lightly loaded, increase the number of CPUs assigned to the group, raise its priority, or, as shown, both:
 #
 # 		ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Batch
 # 			VCPU = 0-3
 # 			THREAD_PRIORITY = 0;
 #
 # RESOURCE GROUP REPLICATION
 #
 # Resource group management is local to the server on which it occurs.
 #
 # Resource group SQL statements and modifications to the resouce_groups data dictionary
 # table are not written to the binary log and are not replicated.  
#
# RESOURCE GROUP RESTRICTIONS
#
# On some platforms or MySQL Server configurations, resource groups are unavailable or have limitations:
#
# 		) Resource groups are unavailable if the thread pool plugin is installed.
#
# 		) Resource groups are unavailable on macOS, which provides no API for binding CPUs to a thread.
#
# 		) On FreeBSD and Solaris, resource group thread priorities are ignored.
#
# 			(Effectively, all threads run at priority 0).
#
# 			Attempts to change priorities result in a warning:
#
# 			ALTER RESOURCE GROUPS abc THREAD_PRIORIY = 10;
# 			Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.18 sec)
#
# 			SHOW WARNINGS;
# 			+--------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| Level 			| Code 		| Message 																			|
# 			+--------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
# 			| Warning 		| 4560 	   | Attribute thread_priority is ignored (using default value) 	   |
# 			+--------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 		) On Linux, resource groups thread priorities are ignored unless the CAP_SYS_NICE capability is set.
#
# 			Granting CAP_SYS_NICE capability to a process enables a range of privileges; consult external resources for that.
#
# 			Be careful when enabling this capability.
#
# 			On Linux platforms using systemd and kernel support for Ambient Capabilities (Linux 4.3 or newer), the recommended
# 			way to enable CAP_SYS_NICE capability is to modify the MySQL service file and leave the mysqld binary unmodified.
#
# 			To adjust the service file for MySQL, use this procedure:
#
# 				a. Run the appropraite command for your platform:
#
# 					> Oracle Linux, Red Hat and Fedora systems:
#
# 						sudo systemctl edit mysqld
#
# 					> SUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian systems:
#
# 						sudo systemctl edit mysql
#
# 				b. Using an editor, add the following text to the service file:
#
# 					[Service]
# 					AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_NICE
#
# 				c. Restart the MySQL Service.
#
# 			If you cannot enable the CAP_SYS_NICE capability as just described, it can be set manually using
# 			the setcap command, specifying the path name to the mysqld executable (this requires sudo access).
#
# 			You can check the capabilities using getcap. For example:
#
# 				sudo set cap_sys_nice+ep /path/to/mysqld
# 				getcap /path/to/mysqld
# 				/path/to/mysqld = cap_sys_nice+ep
#
# 			As a safety measure, restrict execution of the mysqld binary to the root user and users with mysql group membership:
#
# 				sudo chown root:mysql /path/to/mysqld
# 				sudo chmod 0750 /path/to/mysqld
#
# 			IMPORTANT:
#
# 				If manual use of setcap is required, it must be performed after each reinstall.
#
# 		) on Windows, threads run at one of five thread priority levels.
#
# 			The resource group thread priority range of -20 to 19 maps onto those levels
# 			as indicated in the following table.
#
# 			Resource Group Thread Priority on Windows
#
# 			Priority Range 					WINDOWS PRIORITY LEVEL
#
# 			-20 to -10 							THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST
# 			-9 to -1 							THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL
#
# 			0 										THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL
#
# 			1 to 10 								THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL
# 			11 to 19 							THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST
#
# MEASURING PERFORMANCE (BENCHMARKING)
#
# To measure performance, consider the following factors:
#
# 		) Whether you are measuring the speed of a single operation on a quiet system, or how a set of operations
# 			(a "workload") works over a period of time.
#
# 			With simple tests, you usually test how changing one aspect (a configuration setting, the set of indexes
# 			on a table, the SQL clauses in a query) affects performance.
#
# 			Benchmarks are typically long-running and elaborate performance tests, where the results
# 			could dictate high-level choices such as hardware and storage configuration, or how soon to
# 			upgrade to a new MySQL version.
#
# 		) For benchmarking, sometimes you must simulate a heavy database worklaod to get an accurate picture.
#
# 		) Performance can vary depending on so many different facotrs that a difference of a few percentage
# 			points might not be a decisive victory.
#
# 			THe results might shift the oppposite way when you test in a different environment.
#
# 		) Certain MYSQL features help or do not help performance depending on the workload.
#
# 			For completeness, always test performance with those features turned on and 
# 			turned off.
#
# 			The most important feature to try with each workload is the adaptive hash index for InnoDB tables.
#
# This section progresses from simple and direct measurement techniques that a single dev can do,
# to more complicated ones that require additional expertise to perform and interpret hte results.
#
# MEASURING THE SPEED OF EXPRESSIONS AND FUNCTIONS
#
# To measure the speed of a specific MySQL expression or function, invoke the BENCHMARK() function
# using the mysql client program.
#
# its syntax is BENCHMARK(loop count, expression).
#
# The return value is always zero, but mysql prints a line displaying approximately how long
# the statement took to execute.
#
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1);
# 		+----------------------------+
# 		| BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1) 	  |
# 		+----------------------------+
# 		| 							0 		  |
# 		+----------------------------+
# 		1 row in set (0.32 sec)
#
# This result for instance, was done with a Pentium II 400 MHz system.
# It shows that MySQL can perform 1 mil simple addition expresisons in 0.32 on that system.
#
# The built-in MySQL functions are typically highly optimized, but there may be
# some exceptions.
#
# BENCHMARK() is an excellent tool for finding out if some function is a problem for your queries.
#
# USING YOUR OWN BENCHMARKS
#
# Benchmark your application and database to find out where the bottlenecks are.
#
# After fixing one bottleneck (or by replacing it with a "dummy" module), you can proceed
# to identify the next bottleneck.
#
# Even if the overall performance for your application currently is acceptable, you should
# at least make a plan for each bottleneck and decide how to solve if someday you 
# really need that extra performance.
#
# A free benchmark suite is the OPen Source Database Benchmark, available at -> <link>
#
# It is very common for a problem to occur only when hte system is very heavily loaded.
#
# We have had many customers who contact us when they have a (tested) system in production,
# and have encountered load problems.
#
# IN most cases, performance problems turn out ot be due to issues of basic DB design
# (for example, table scans are not good under high load) or problems with the OS or libraries.
#
# Most of the time, these problems would be much easier to fix if the systems were not
# already in production.
#
# To avoid problems like this, benchmark your whole application under hte worst possible load:
#
# 		) The mysqlslap program can be helpful for simulating a high load produced by multiple clients issuing queries
# 			simultaneously.
#
# 			See mysqlslap - LOAD EMULATION CLIENT for more info.
#
# 		) You can also try benchmarking packages such as SysBench and DBT2, available at _> Links.
#
# These programs or packages can bring a system to its knees, so be sure to use them only on your
# development systems.
#
# MEASURING PERFORMANCE WITH PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA
#
# You can query the tables in the performance_schema database to see real-time
# information about the performance characteristics of your server and the application it is
# running.
#
# See CHAPTER 26, MYSQL PERFORMANCE SCHEMA for details.
#
# EXAMINING THREAD INFORMATION
#
# When you are attempting to ascertain what your MysQL server is doing, it can be helpful to
# examine the process list, which is the set of threads currently executing within
# the server.
#
# Process list information is available from these sources:
#
# 		) The SHOW [FULL] PROCESSLIST statement: More under SHOW PROCESSLIST SYNTAX Section 13.7.6.29
#
# 		) The SHOW_PROFILE statement: Section 13.7.6.31, "SHOW PROFILES Syntax"
#
# 		) The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST table: Section 25.18, "The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table"
#
# 		) The mysqladmin processlist command: Section 4.5.2, MYSQLADMIN - CLIENT FOR ADMINISTERING A MYSQL SERVER
#
# 		) The Performance Schema threads table, stage tables, and lock tables: See 26.12.17, PERFORMANCE SCHEMA MISCELLANEOUS TABLES,
# 			SECTION 26.12.5 "PERFORMANCE SCHEMA STAGE EVENT TABLES", SECTION 26.12.12 "PERFORMANCE SCHEMA LOCK TABLES" for more info.
#
# Access to threads does not require a mutex and has a minimal impact on server performance.
#
# INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST and SHOW_PROCESSLIST have negative performance consequences
# because they require a mutex.
#
# threads also shows information about background threads, which INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST
# and SHOW_PROCESSLIST do not. 
#
# This means that threads can be used to monitor activity the other thread information
# sources cannot.
#
# YOu can always view information about your own threads. To view information about threads being executed for other
# accounts, you must have the PROCESS privilege.
#
# Each process list entry contains several pieces of information:
#
# 		) ID is the connection identifier for the client associated with the thread.
#
# 		) User and Host indicate the account associated with the htread.
#
# 		) db is the default daatbase for the thread, or NULL if none is selected.
#
# 		) Command and State indicate what the thread is doing.
#
# 			Most states correspond to very quick operations. If a thread stays in a given state
# 			for many seconds, there might be a problem that needs to be investigated.
#
# 		) Time indicates how long the thread has been in its current state.
#
# 			The thread's notion of hte current time may be altered in some cases:
#
# 			The thread can change the time with SET_TIMESTAMP = value.
#
# 			For a thread running on a slave that is processing events from the master,
# 			the thread time is set ot the time found in the events and thus reflects
# 			current time on the master and not hte slave.
#
# 		) Info contains the text of the statement being executed by the thread, or NULL if it is not executing one.
# 			By default, this value contains only the first 100 characters of the statement.
#
# 			TO see the complete statements, use SHOW_FULL_PROCESSLIST.
#
# 		) The sys schema processlist view, which presents information from the Performance Schema threads
# 			table in a more accessible format, see:
#
# 			Section 27.4.3.22 "THE PROCESSLIST AND x$processlist VIEWS"
#
# 		) The sys schema session view, which presents information about user sessions (like the sys schema processlist view, but with
# 			background processes filtered out):
#
# 			Section 27.4.3.33 "The session and x$session Views"
#
# The following sections list hte possible Command values, and State values grouped by category.
# The meaning of some of these values is self-evident.
#
# For others, additional description is provided.
#

#
# GENERAL THREAD STATES
#
# The following list describes thread State values that are associated with general query processing
# and not more specialized activities such as replication.
#
# Many of these are useful only for finding bugs in the server.
#
# 		) After create
#
# 			This occurs when the thread creates a table (including internal temporary tables), at the end of
# 			the function that creates the table:
#
# 			This state is used even if the table could not be created due to some error.
#
# 		) Analyzing
#
# 			The thread is calculating a MyISAM table key distrib (for example, for ANALYZE_TABLE)
#
# 		) Checking permissions
#
# 			The thread is checking whether hte server has the required privileges to execute the statement
#
# 		) Checking table
#
# 			The thread is performing a table check operation
#
# 		) cleaning up
#
# 			The thread has processed one command and is prepared to free memory and reset certain state variables.
#
# 		) closing tables
#
# 			The thread is flushing the changed table data to disk and closing the used tables.
# 			THis should be a fast operation.
#
# 			If not, verify that you do not have a full disk and that hte disk is not in very heavy use.
#
# 		) converting HEAP to ondisk
#
# 			The thread is converting an internal temporary table from a MEMORY table to an on-disk table.
#
# 		) copy to tmp table
#
# 			The thread is processing an ALTER_TABLE statement.
#
# 			This state occurs after the table with the new structure has been created, but before
# 			rows are copied into it.
#
# 			For a thread in this state, the Performance Schema can be used to obtain about hte progress
# 			of the copy operation.
#
# 			See SECTION 26.12.5 "Performance Schema Stage Event Tables"
#
# 		) Copying to group table
#
# 			If a statemnet has different ORDER BY and GROUP BY criteria, the rows are sorted by group and
# 			copied to a temporary table.
#
# 		) Copying to tmp table
#
# 			The server is copying to a temporary table in memory.
#
# 		) Altering table
#
# 			The server is in the process of executing an in-place ALTER_TABLE
#
# 		) Copying to tmp table on disk
#
# 			The server is copying to a temporary table on disk.
# 			The temporary result set has become too large (see SECTION 8.4.4 "INTERNAL TEMPORARY TABLE USE IN MYSQL")
#
# 			Consequently, the thread is changing the temporary table from in-memory to disk-based format to save memory.
#
# 		) Creating index
#
# 			The thread is processing ALTER TABLE --- ENABLE KEYS for a MyISAM table.
#
# 		) Creating sort index
#
# 			The thread is processing a SELECT that is resolving using an internal temporary table.
#
# 		) creating table
#
# 			The thread is creating a table. This includes creation of temporary tables.
#
# 		) Creating tmp table
#
# 			The thread is creating a temporary table in memory or on disk.
#
# 			If the table is created in memory, but later is converted to an on-disk table,
# 			the state during that operationg will be Copying to tmp table on disk.
#
# 		) comitting alter table to storage engine
#
# 			The server has finished an in-place ALTER TABLE and is committing the result.
#
# 		) deleting from main table
#
# 			The server is executing the first part of a multiple-table delete.
#
# 			It is deleting only from the first table, and saving columns and offsets to be used
# 			for deleting from the other (reference) tables.
#
# 		) deleting from reference table
#
# 			The server is executing the second part of a multiple-table delete and deleting the matched rows
# 			from the other tables.
#
# 		) discard_or_import_tablespace
#
# 			The thread is processing an ALTER TABLE --- DISCARD TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLE --- IMPORT TABLESPACE
# 			statement.
#
# 		) end
#
# 			THis occurs at the end but before the cleanup of ALTER_TABLE, CREATE_VIEW, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT or UPDATE statements.
#
# 		) executing
#
# 			The thread has beung executing a statement
#
# 		) Execution of init_command
#
# 			The thread is executing statements in the value of the init_command system variable.
#
# 		) freeing items
#
# 			The thread has executed a command. This state is usually follwoed by cleaning up.
#
# 		) FULLTEXT initialization
#
# 			The server is preparing to perform a natural-langauge full-text search
#
# 		) init
#
# 			This occurs before the intiialization of ALTER_TABLE, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT or UPDATE statements.
# 			Actions taken by the server in this state include flushing the binary log and the InnoDB log.
#
# 			For the end state, the following operations could be happening:
#
# 				) Writing an event ot the binary log
#
# 				) Freeing memory buffers, including for blobs
#
# 		) Killed
#
# 			Someone has sent a KILL statement to the thread and it should abort next time it checks the kill flag.
#
# 			The flag is checked in each major loop in MySQL, but in some cases it might still take a short time
# 			for the thread to die.
#
# 			If the thread is locked by some other thread, the kill takes effect as soon as the other thread releases its lock.
#
# 		) Locking system tables
#
# 			The thread is trying to lock a system table (for example, a time zone or log table)
#
# 		) logging slow query
#
# 			The thread is writing a statement to the slow-query log.
#
# 		) login
#
# 			The intial state for a connection thread until the client has been
# 			authenticated successfully.
#
# 		) manage keys
#
# 			The server is enabling or disabling a table index.
#
# 		) NULL
#
# 			This state is used for the SHOW_PROCESSLIST state.
#
# 		) Opening system tables
#
# 			The thread is trying to open a system table (for example, a time zone or log table)
#
# 		) Opening tables
#
# 			THe thread is trying to open a table. 
#
# 			This hsould be a very fast procedure, unless something prevents opening.
#
# 			For example, an ALTER_TABLE or a LOCK_TABLE statement can prevent opening
# 			a table until the statement is finished.
#
# 			It is also worth checking that your table_open_cache value is large enough.
#
# 			For system tables, the Opening system tables state is used instead.
#
# 		) optimizing
#
# 			The server is performing initial optimizations for a query.
#
# 		) preparing
#
# 			This state occurs during query optimization.
#
# 		) Purging old relay logs
#
# 			The thread is removing unneeded relay log files.
#
# 		) query end
#
# 			This state occurs after processing a query but before the freeing items state.
#
# 		) Receiving from client
#
# 			The server is reading a packet from the client.
#
# 		) Removing duplicates
#
# 			The query was using SELECT_DISTINCT in such a way that MySQL could not optimize away
# 			the distinct operation at an early stage.
#
# 			Because of this, MySQL requires an extra stage to remove all duplicated rows
# 			before sending the result to the client.
#
# 		) removing tmp table
#
# 			The thread is removing an internal temporary table after processing a SELECT statement.
# 			This state is not used if no temporary table was created.
#
# 		) rename
#
# 			The thread is renaming a table
#
# 		) Rename result table
#
# 			The thread is processing an ALTER_TABLE statement, has created the new table, and is
# 			renaming it to replace the original table.
#
# 		) Reopen tables
#
# 			The thread got a lock for the table, but noticed after getting the lock that
# 			the underlying table structure changed.
#
# 			It has freed the lock, closed the table, and is trying to reopen it.
#
# 		) Repair by sorting
#
# 			The repair code is using a sort of create indexes.
#
# 		) preparing for alter table
#
# 			The server is preparing to execute an in-place ALTER_TABLE
#
# 		) Repair done
#
# 			The thread has completed a multithreaded repair for a myISAM table.
#
# 		) Repair with keycache
#
# 			THe repair code is using creating keys one by one through the key cache.
# 			THis is much slower than Repair by sorting.
#
# 		) Rolling back
#
# 			The thread is rolling back a transaction.
#
# 		) Saving State
#
# 			For MyISAM table operations such as repair or analysis, the thread
# 			is saving the new table state to the .MYI file header.
#
# 			States includes informaiton such as number of rows, the AUTO_INCREMENT counter,
# 			and key distribs.
#
# 		) Searching rows for update
#
# 			The thread is doing a first phase to find all matching rows before updating them.
# 			
# 			This has ot be done if the UPDATE is changing the index that is used to find the
# 			involved rows.
#
# 		) Sending data
#
# 			THe thread is reading and processing rows for a SELECT statement, and sending data to the client.
#
# 			Because operations occurring during this state tend to perform large amounts of disk
# 			access (reads), it is often the longest-running state over the lifetime of a given query.
#
# 		) Sending to client
#
# 			The server is writing a pcket ot hte client.
#
# 		) Setup
#
# 			The thread is beginning an ALTER_TABLE operation.
#
# 		) Sorting for group
#
# 			The thread is doing a sort to satisfy a GROUP BY.
#
# 		) Sorting for order
#
# 			The thread is doing a sort to satisfy an ORDER BY.
#
# 		) Sorting index
#
# 			The thread is sorting index pages for more efficient accessing during a MyISAM table optimization operation.
#
# 		) Sorting result
#
# 			For a SELECT statement, this is similar to Creating sort index, but for nontemporary tables.
#
# 		) statistics
#
# 			The server is calculating statistics to develop a query execution plan.
#
# 			If a thread is in this state for a long time, the server is probably disk-bound
# 			performing other work.
#
# 		) System lock
#
# 			The thread has called mysql_lock_tables() and the thread state has not been updated since.
#
# 			This is a very general state that cna occur for many reasons.
#
# 			FOr example, the thread is going to request or is waiting for an internal or external system lock for the table.
#
# 			THis can occur when InnoDB waits for a table-level lock during execution of LOCK_TABLES.
#
# 			IF this state is being caused by requests for external locks and you are not using multiple mysqld servers
# 			that are accessing the same MyISAM tables, you can disable external system locks with the --skip-external-locking option.
#
# 			However, external locking is disabled by default, so it is likely that htis option will ahve no effect.
#
# 			For SHOW_PROFILE, this state means the thread is requesting the lock (not waiting for it)
#
# 			For system tables, the Locking system tables state is used instead.
#
# 		) update
#
# 			The thread is getting ready to start updating the table.
#
# 		) Updating
#
# 			The thread is searching for rows to update and is updating them.
#
# 		) Updating main table
#
# 			The server is executing the first part of a multiple-table update. It is updating only
# 			and saving columns and offsets to be used for updating the other (reference) tables.
#
# 		) updating reference tables
#
# 			The server is executing the second part of a multiple-table update and updating the matched rows
# 			from the other tables.
#
# 		) User lock
#
# 			The thread is going to request or is waiting for an advisory lock requested with a GET_LOCK() call.
# 			For SHOW_PROFILE, this state means the thread is requesting the lock (not waiting for it)
#
# 		) User sleep
#
# 			The thread has invoked a SLEEP() call
#
# 		) Waiting for commit lock
#
# 			FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is waiting for a commit lock.
#
# 		) Waiting for global read lock
#
# 			FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is waiting for a global read lock or the global read only system variable is being set.
#
# 		) Waiting for tables
#
# 			The thread got a notification that the underlying structure for a table has changed and it needs
# 			to reopen the table to get the new structure.
#
# 			However, to reopen the table, it must wait until all other threads have closed the table in question.
#
# 			This notification takes place if another thread has used FLUSH_TABLES or one of the following statements
# 			on the table in question:
#
# 			FLUSH TABLES tbl_name, ALTER TABLE, RENAME TABLE, REPAIR TABLE, ANALYZE TABLE or OPTIMIZE TABLE
#
# 		) Waiting for table flush
#
# 			The thread is executing FLUSH TABLES and is waiting for all threads to close their tables,
# 			or the thread got a notification that the underlying structure for a table has changed and
# 			it needs to reopen the table to get the new structure.
#
# 			However, to reopen the table, it must wait until all other threads have closed the table
# 			in question.
#
# 			This notification takes place if another thread has used FLUSH TABLES or one of the following
# 			statements on the table in question:
#
# 			FLUSH TABLES tbl_name, ALTER_TABLE, RENAME_TABLE, REPAIR_TABLE, ANALYZE_TABLE or OPTIMIZE_TABLE.
#
# 		) Waiting for lock_type lock
#
# 			The server is waiting to acquire a THR_LOCK lock or a lock from the metadata locking subsystem,
# 			where lock_type indicates the type of lock.
#
# 			This state indicates a wait for a THR_LOCK:
#
# 				) Waiting for table level lock
#
# 			These states indicate a wait for a metadata lock:
#
# 				) Waiting for event metadata lock
#
# 				) Waiting for global read lock
#
# 				) Waiting for schema metadata lock
#
# 				) Waiting for stored function metadata lock
#
# 				) Waiting for stored procedure metadata lock
#
# 				) Waiting for table metadata lock
#
# 				) Waiting for trigger metadata lock
#
# 			For information about table lock indicators, see 8.11.1, "INTERNAL LOCKING METHODS"
#
# 			For information about metadata locking, see Section 8.11.4, "Metadata Locking"
#
# 			To see which locks are blocking lock requests, use the Performance Schema lock tables
# 			described in Section 26.12.12 "PERFORMANCE SCHEMA LOCK TABLES"
#
# 		) Waiting on cond
#
# 			A generic state in which the thread is waiting for a condition to become true.
# 			No specific state information is available.
#
# 		) Writing to net
#
# 			The server is writing a packet to the network.
#
# REPLICATION MASTER THREAD STATES
#
# The following list shows the most common states you may see in the State column for the
# master's Binlog Dump thread.
#
# If you see no Binlog Dump threads on a master server, this means that replication is not
# running; that is, that no slaves are currently connected.
#
# 		) Finished reading one binlog; switching to next binlog
#
# 			The thread has finished reading a binary log file and is opening the next one to send to the slave.
#
# 		) Master has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for more updates
#
# 			The thread has read all remaining updates from the binary logs and sent them to the slave.
#
# 			The thread is now idle, waiting for new events to appear in the binary log resulting
# 			from new updates occurring on the master.
#
# 		) Sending binlog event to slave
#
# 			Binary log consists of events, where an event is usually an update plus some other information.
#
# 			The thread has read an event from the binary log and is now sending it to the slave.
#
# 		) Waiting to finalize termination
#
# 			A very brief state that occurs as the thread is stopping.
#
# REPLICATION SLAVE I/O THREAD STATES
#
# The following list shows the most common states you see in the State column for a slave server I/O thread.

# a good view of what is happening by using that statement.
#
# 		) Checking master version
#
# 			A state that occurs very briefly, after the connection to the master is established.
#
# 		) Connecting to master

#
# 			A state that occurs very briefly after the connection to the master is established.
#
# 		) Requesting binlog dump
#
# 			A state that occurs very briefly, after the connection to the master is established.
#
# 			The thread sends to the master a request for the contents of its binary logs,
# 			starting from the requested binary log file name and position.
#
# 		) Waiting for its turn to commit
#
# 			A state that occurs when the slave thread is waiting for older worker threads to commit if
# 			slave_preserve_commit_order is enabled.
#
# 		) Waiting for master to  send event
#
# 			The thread has connected to the master and is waiting for binary log events to arrive.
#
# 			This can last for a long time if the master is idle.
#
# 			If the wait lasts for slave_net_timeout seconds, a timeout occurs.
#
# 			At that point, the thread considers the connection to be broken and makes an attempt to reconnect.
#
# 		) Waiting for master update
#
# 			The initial state before Connecting to master.
#
# 		) Waiting for slave mutex on exit
#
# 			A state that occurs briefly as the thread is stopping.
#
# 		) Waiting for the slave SQL thread to free enough relay log space
#
# 			You are using a nonzero relay_log_space_limit value, and the relay logs have grown
# 			large enough that their combined sized exceeds this value.
#
# 			The I/O thread is waiting until the SQL thread frees enough space by processing relay log contents
# 			so that it can delete some relay log files.
#
# 		) Waiting to reconnect after a failed binlog dump request
#
# 			If the binary log dump request failed (due to disconnection), the thread goes into this state
# 			while it sleeps, then tries to reconnect periodically.
#
# 			The interval between retries can be specified using the CHANGE_MASTER_TO statement.
#
# 		) Waiting to reconnect after a failed master event read
#
# 			An error occurred while reading (due to disconnection). 
#
# 			The thread is sleeping for the number of seconds set by the CHANGE_MASTER_TO statement
# 			(default to 60) before attempting to reconnect.
#

# 			containing the data from which the slave will read rows.
#
# 		) Making temporary file (create) before replaying LOAD DATA INFILE
#
# 			The thread is executing a LOAD_DATA_INFILE statement and is creating a temporary file containing
# 			the data from which the slave will read rows.

# 			Using the multithreaded slave (slave_parallel worker is greater than 1), one of the slave worker
# 			threads is waiting for an event from the coordinator thread.
#
# 		) Waiting for slave mutex on exit
#
# 			A very brief state that occurs as the thread is stopping.
#
# 		) Waiting for Slave Workers to free pending events
#
# 			This waiting action occurs when the total size of events being processed by Workers exceeds
# 			the size of the slave_pending_jobs_size_max system variable.
#
# 			The Coordinator resumes scheduling when the size drops below this limit.
#
# 			This state occurs only when slave_parallel_workers is set greater than 0.

# 			This delay is set with the MASTER_DELAY option of CHANGE_MASTER_TO.
#
# The Info column for the SQL thread may also show the text of a statement.
#
# This indicates that the thread has read an event from the relay log, extracted the statement
# from it, and may be executing it.

#
# LANGUAGE STRUCTURE
#
# This chapter discusses the rules for writing the following elements of SQL statements when using MySQL:
#
# 		) Literal values such as strings and numbers
#
# 		) Identifiers such as database, table and column names
#
# 		) Keywords and reserved words
#
# 		) User-defined and system variables
#
# 		) Comments
#
# LITERAL VALUES
#
# This section describes how to write literal values in MYSQL.
# These include strings, numbers, hexadecimal and bit values, boolean values and NULL.
#
# The section also covers various nuances that you may encounter when dealing with these basic types
# in MySQL.
#
# STRING LITERALS
#
# A string is a sequence of bytes of characters, enclosed within either single quote (') or double
# quote (") characters.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		'a string'
# 		"another string"
#
# Quoted strings placed next to each other are concatenated to a single string.
#
# The following lines are equivalent:
#
# 		'a string'
# 		'a' ' ' 'string'
#
# If the ANSI_QUOTES SQL mode is enabled, string literals can be quoted only within single
# quotation marks because a string quoted within double quotation marks is interpreted as an identifier.
#
# A binary string is a string of bytes. Every binary string has a character set and collation named binary.
#
# A nonbinary string is a string of characters.
#
# It has a character set other than binary and a collation that is compatible with the character set.
#
# For both types of strings, comparisons are based on the numeric values of the string unit.
# For binary strings, the unit is the byte; Comparisons using numeric byte values.
#
# FOr nonbinary strings, the unit is the character and some character sets support multibyte characters;
# comparisons use numeric character code values.
#
# Character code ordering is a function of the string collation.
#
# (For more information, See SECTION 10.8.5 "THE BINARY COLLATION COMPARED TO _BIN COLLATIONS")
#
# A character string literal may have an optional character set introducer and COLLATE clause,
# to designate it as a string that uses a particular character set and collation:
#
# 		[_charset_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name]
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT _latin1'string';
# 		SELECT _binary'string';
# 		SELECT _utf8'string' COLLATE utf8_danish_ci;
#
# You can use N'literal' (or n'literal') to create a string in the national character set.
# These statements are equivalent:
#
# 		SELECT N'some text';
# 		SELECT n'some text';
# 		SELECT _utf8'some text';
#
# For information about these forms of string syntax, See SECTION 10.3.7, "THE NATIONAL CHARACTER SET", and SECTION 10.3.8, "CHARACTER SET INTRODUCERS"
#
# Within a string, certain sequences have special meaning unless the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is enabled.
# Each of these sequences begins with a backslash (\), known as the escape character.
#
# MySQL recognizes the escape sequences shown soon.
#
# For all other escape sequences, backslash is ignored.
# That is, the escaped character is interpreted as if it was not escaped.
#
# For example, \x is just x. These sequences are case-sensitive.
#
# For example, \b is interpreted as Backspace, but \B is interpted as B.
#
# Escape processing is done according to the character set indicated by the character_set_connection
# system variable.
#
# This is true even for strings that are preceded by an introducer that indicates a different character set,
# as discussed in SECTION 10.3.6, "CHARACTER STRING LITERAL CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION"
#
# SPECIAL CHARACTER ESCAPE SEQUENCES
#
# Escape Sequence 	Character Represented by Sequence
#
# 	\0 					 An ASCII NUL (X'00') character
#  \' 					 A single quote (') character
#
#  \" 					A double quote (") character
#  \b 					A backspace character
#
# 	\n 					A newline (linefeed) character
# 	\r 					A carriage return character
#  \t 					A tab character
#
# 	\Z 					ASCII 26 (Control+Z); see note following the table
# 	\\ 					A backslash (\) character
# 	\% 					A % character; see note following the table
# 	\_ 					A _ character; see note following the table
#
# The ASCII 26 character can be encoded as \Z to enable you to work around the problem that ASCII 26
# stands for EOF on Windows.
#
# ASCII 26 within a file causes problems if you try to use mysql db_name < file_name
#
# The \% and \_ sequences are used to search for literal instances of % and _ in pattern-matching
# contexts where they would otherwise be interpreted as wildcard characters.
#
# See the description of the LIKE operator in SECTION 12.5.1 "STRING COMPARISON FUNCTIONS"
#
# If you use \% or \_ outside of pattern-matching contexts, they evaluate to the strings \% and \_, not % and _
#
# There are several ways to include quote characters within a string:
#
# 		) A ' inside a string quoted with ' may be written as ''
#
# 		) A " inside a string quoted with " may be written as ""
#
# 		) Precede the quote character by an escape character (\)
#
# 		) A ' inside a string quoted with " needs no special treatment and need not be 
# 			doubled or escaped.
#
# 			In the same way, " inside a string quoted with ' needs no special treatment.
#
# The following SELECT statements demonstrate how quoting and escaping work:
#
# 		SELECT 'hello', '"hello"', '""hello""', 'hel''lo', '\'hello';
# 		+--------+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
# 		| hello  | "hello"  | ""hello""  | hel'lo  | 'hello    |
# 		+--------+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
#
# 		SELECT "hello", "'hello'", "''hello''", "hel""lo", "\"hello";
# 		+--------+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
# 		| hello  | 'hello'  | ''hello''  | hel"lo  | "hello 	 |
# 		+--------+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
#
# 
# 		SELECT 'This\nIs\nFour\nLines';
# 		+----------------+
# 		| This 			  |
# 		| Is 				  |
# 		| Four 			  |
# 		| Lines 			  |
# 		+----------------+
#
# 		SELECT 'disappearing\ backslash';
# 		+------------------------+
# 		| disappearing backslash |
#  	+------------------------+
#
# To insert binary data into a string column (such as a BLOB column), you should represent certain characters by
# escape sequences.
#
# Backslash (\) and the quote character used to quote the string must be escaped.
#
# In certain client environments, it may also be necessary to escape NULL or Control+Z.
#
# The mysql client truncates quoted strings containing NUL characters if they are not escaped,
# and Control+Z may be taken for EOF on Windows if not escaped.
#
# For the escape sequences that represent each of these characters, see Special Character Escape Sequences.
#
# When writing application programs, any string that might contain any of these special characters
# must be properly escaped before the string is used as a data value in an SQL statement that is
# sent to the MySQL server.
#
# You can do this in two ways:
#
# 		) Process the string with a function that escapes the special characters.
#
# 			In a C program, you can use the mysql_real_escape_string_quote() C API function
# 			to escape characters.
#
# 			See SECTION 28.7.7.56 "MYSQL_REAL_ESCAPE_STRING_QUOTE()"
#
# 			Within SQL statements that construct other SQL statements, you can use the
# 			QUOTE() function.
#
# 			The Perl DBI interface provides a quote method to convert special characters
# 			to the proper escape sequences.
#
# 			See SECTION 28.9, "MYSQL PERL API"
#
# 			Other language interfaces may provide a similar capability.
#
# 		) As an alternative to explicitly escaping special characters, many MySQL APIs provide
# 			a placeholder capability that enables you to insert special markers into a statement string,
# 			and then bind data values to them when you issue the statement.
#
# 			In this case, the API takes care of escaping special characters in the values for you.
#
# NUMERIC LITERALS
#
# Number literals include exact-value (integer and DECIMAL) literals and approximate value (floating point) literals.
#
# Integers are represented as a sequence of digits. Numbers may include . as a decimal separator.
#
# NUmbers may be preceded by - or + to indicate a negative or positive values, respectively.
#
# Numbers represented in scientific notation with a mantissa and exponent are approximate-value numbers.
#
# Exact-value numeric literals have an integer part or fractional part, or both.
#
# They may be signed. Examples 1, .2, 3.4, -5, -6.78, +9.10
#
# Approximate-value numeric literals are represented in scientific notation with a mantissa and exponent.
# Either or both partys may be signed. Examples:
#
# 1.2E3, 1.2E-3, -1.2E3, -1.2E-3
#
# Tow numbers that look similar may be treated differently. For example, 2.34 is an exact-value (fixed point)
# number, whereas 2.34E0 is an approximate value (floating point numbers)
#
# The DECIMAL data type is a fixed-point type and calculations are exact.
#
# In MySQL, the DECIMAL type has several synonyms: NUMERIC, DEC, FIXED.
#
# The integer types also are exact-value types.
#
# For more info about exact value calculations, see SECTION 12.24 "PRECISION MATH"
#
# The FLOAT and DOUBLE data types are floating-point types and calculations are approximate.
# In MySQL, types that are synonymous with FLOAT or DOUBLE are DOUBLE PRECISION and REAL.
#
# An integer may be used in a floating-point context; it is interpreted as the equivalent
# floating-point number.
#
# DATE AND TIME LITERALS
#
# Date and time values can be represented in several formats, such as quoted strings or as numbers,
# depending on the exact type of the value and other factors.
#
# For example, in contexts where MySQL expects a date, it interprets any of '2015-07-21',
# '20150721' and 20150721 as a date.
#
# This section describes the acceptable formats for date and time literals.
#
# For more information about the temporal data types, such as the range of permitted values,
# consult these sections:
#
# 		) SECTION 11.1.2, "DATE AND TIME TYPE OVERVIEW"
#
# 		) SECTION 11.3, "DATE AND TIME TYPES"
#
# Standard SQL and ODBC Date and Time Literals.
# Standard SQL permits temporal literals to be specified using a type keyword
# and a string.
#
# The space between the keyword and string is optional.
#
# 		DATE 'str'
# 		TIME 'str'
# 		TIMESTAMP 'str'
#
# MySQL recognizes those constructions and also the corresponding ODBC syntax:
#
# 		{ d 'str' }
# 		{ t 'str' }
# 		{ ts 'str' }
#
# MySQL uses the type keyword and these constructions produce DATE, TIME and DATETIME values, respectively, including
# a trailing fractional seconds part if specified.
#
# The TIMESTAMP syntax produces a DATETIME value in MySQL because DATETIME has a range that
# more closely corresponds to the standard SQL TIMESTAMP type, which has a year range from
# 0001 to 9999.
#
# (The MySQL TIMESTAMP year range is 1970 to 2038)
#
# String and Numeric Literals in Date and Time Context. MySQL recognizes DATE values in these formats:
#
# 		) As a string in either 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD' format. A "relaxed" syntax is permitted:
#
# 			Any punctuation character may be used as the delimiter between date parts.
#
# 			For example, '2012-12-31', '2012/12/31', '2012^12^31' and '2012@12@31' are equivalent.
#
# 		) As a string with no delimiters in either 'YYYYMMDD' or 'YYMMDD' format, provided that the string
# 			makes sense as a date.
#
# 			For example, '20070523' and '070523' are interpreted as '2007-05-23', but '071332' is illegal
# 			(it has nonsensical month and day parts) and becomes '0000-00-00'
#
# 		) As a number in either YYYYMMDD or YYMMDD format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.
# 			For example, 19830905 and 830905 are interpreted as '1983-09-05'
#
# MySQL recognizes DATETIME and TIMESTAMP values in these formats:
#
# 		) As a string in either 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format.
#
# 			A "relaxed" syntax is permitted here, too:
#
# 				Any punctuation character may be used as the delimiter between date parts
# 				or times parts.
#
# 				For example, '2012-12-31 11:30:45', '2012^12^31 11+30+45', '2012/12/31 11*30*45'
# 				and '2012@12@31 11^30^45' are equivalent.
#
# 				The only delimiter recognized between a date and time part and a fractional second part
# 				is the decimal point.
#
# 				The date and time parts can be separated by T rather than a space. For example, '2012-12-31 11:30:45'
# 				'2012-12-31T11:30:45' are equivalent.
#
# 		) As a string with no delimiters in either 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS' format, provided that the string
# 			makes sense as a date.
#
# 			For example '20070523091528' and '070523091528' are interpreted as '2007-05-23 09:15:28', but the other is illegal,
# 			(Due to violation on minute part) and becomes '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
#
# 		) As a number in either YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.
#
# 			For example, 19830905132800 and 830905132800 are both interpreted as:
#
# 				'1983-09-05 13:28:00'
#
# A DATETIME or TIMESTAMP value can include a trailing fractional second part in up to microseconds (6 digits) precision.
#
# The fractional part should always be separated from the rest of the time by a decimal point;
# No other fractional seconds delimiter is recognized.
#
# For information about fractional seconds support in MySQL, see SECTION 11.3.6, "FRACTIONAL SECONDS IN TIME VALUES"
#
# Dates containing two-digit year values are ambiguous because teh century is unknown.
#
# MySQL interprets two-digit year values using these rules:
#
# 		) year values in the range 70-99 are converted to 1970-1999
#
# 		) Year values in the range 00-69 are converted to 2000-2069
#
# See also SECTION 11.3.8, "TWO-DIGIT YEARS IN DATES"
#
# For values specified as strings that include date part delimiters, it is unnecessary to specify
# two digits for month or day values that are less than 10.
#
# '2015-6-9' is the same as '2015-06-09'.
#
# Similarly, for values specified as strings that include time part delimiters, it is unnecessary
# to specify two digits for hour, minute or second values that are less than 10.
#
# '2015-10-30 1:2:3' is the same as '2015-10-30 01:02:03'
#
# Values specified as numbers should be 6, 8, 12 or 14 digits long.
#
# If a number is 8 or 14 digits long, it is assumed to be in YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format and
# that the year is given by the first 4 digits.
#
# If the number is 6 or 12 digits long, it is assumed to be in YYMMDD or YYMMDDHHMMSS format and
# that hte year is given by the first 2 digits.
#
# Numbers that are not one of these lengths are interpreted as though padded with leading zeros to
# the closest length.
#
# Values specified as nondelimited strings are interpreted according to their length.
# For a string 8 or 14 characters long, the year is assumed to be given by the first 4 characters.
#
# Otherwise, the year is assumed to be given by the first 2 characters.
#
# The string is interpreted from left to right to find year, month, day, hour, minute and
# second values, for as many parts as are present in the string.
#
# This means you should not use strings that have fewer than 6 characters.
#
# For example, if you specify '9903', thinking that represents March, 1999, MySQL converts
# it to the "zero" date value.
#
# This occurs because the year and month values are 99 and 03, but the day part is
# completely missing.
#
# However, you can explicitly specify a value of zero to represent missing month or day parts.
# For example, to insert the value '1999-03-00', use '990300'
#
# MySQL recognizes TIME values in these formats:
#
# 		) As a string in 'D HH:MM:SS' format. You can also use one of the following "relaxed" syntaxes:
#
# 			'HH:MM:SS', 'HH:MM', 'D HH:MM', 'D HH' or 'SS'
#
# 			Here D is day, it can range from 0 to 34
#
# 		) As a string with no delimiters in 'HHMMSS' format, provided that it makes sense as a time.
#
# 			For example, '101112' is understood as '10:11:12', but '109712' is illegal (it has a nonsensical
# 			minute part) and becomes '00:00:00'
#
# 		) As a number in HHMMSS format, provided that it makes sense as a time.
#
# 			For example, 101112 is understood as '10:11:12'
#
# 			The following alternative formats are also understood: SS, MMSS, or HHMMSS
#
# A trailing fractional seconds part is recognized in the 'D HH:MM:SS.fraction', 'HH:MM:SS.fraction' and
# HHMMSS.fraction time formats, where fraction is the fractional part in up to microseconds (6 digits) precision.
#
# The fractional part should always be separated from the rest of the time by a decimal point, no other
# fractional seconds delimiter is recognized.
#
# For information about fractional seconds support in MySQL, see 11.3.6 "FRACTIONAL SECONDS IN TIME VALUES"
#
# For TIME values specified as strings that include a time part delimiter, it is unnecessary to specify
# two digits for hours, minutes or seconds values that are less than 10.
#
# '8:3:2' is the same as '08:03:02'
#
# HEXADECIMAL LITERALS
#
# Hexadecimal literal values are written using X'val' or 0xval notation, where val contains
# hexadecimal digits (0..9, A..F)
#
# Lettercase of the digits and of any leading X does not matter.
#
# A leading 0x is case-sensitive and cannot be written as 0X
#
# Legal hexaecimal literals:
#
# 		X'01AF'
# 		X'01af'
# 		x'01AF'
# 		x'01af'
# 		0x01AF
# 		0x01af
#
# Illegal hexadecimal literals:
#
# 		X'0G' (G is not a hexadecimal digit)
# 		0X01AF (0X must be written as 0x)
#
# Values written using X'val' notation must contain en even number of digits or a syntax error occurs.
# To correct the problem, pad the value with a leading zero:
#
# 		SET @s = X'FFF';
# 		ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax;
# 		check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server
# 		version for the right syntax to use near 'X'FFF''
#
# 		SET @s = X'0FFF';
# 		QUery OK, 0 rwos affected (0.00 sec)
#
# Values written using 0xval notation that contain an odd number of digits are treated as having
# an extra leading 0.
#
# For example, 0xaaa is interpreted as 0x0aaa
#
# By default, a hexadecimal literal is a binary string, where each pair of hexadecimal digits represent a character:
#
# 		SELECT X'4D7953514C', CHARSET(X'4D7953514C');
# 		+-------------------+------------------------+
# 		| X'4D7953514C' 	  | CHARSET(X'4D7953514C') |
# 		+-------------------+------------------------+
# 		| MySQL 				  | binary 					   |
# 		+-------------------+------------------------+
#
# 		SELECT 0x5461626c65, CHARSET(0x5461626c65);
# 		+-------------------+------------------------+
# 		| 0x5461626c65 	  | CHARSET(0x5461626c65 	|
# 		+-------------------+------------------------+
# 		| Table 			  	  | binary 						|
# 		+-------------------+------------------------+
#
# A hexadecimal literal may have an optional character set introducer and COLLATE clause,
# to designate it as a string that uses a particular character set and collation:
#
# 		[_charset_name] X'val' [COLLATE collation_name]
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT _latin1 X'4D7953514C';
# 		SELECT _utf8 0x4D7953514C COLLATE utf8_danish_ci;
#
# The examples use X'val' notation, but 0xval notation permits introducers as well.
# For information about introducers, see SECTION 10.3.8 "CHARACTER SET INTRODUCERS"
#
# In numeric contexts, MySQL treats a hexadecimal literal like a BIGINT(64-bit integer)
#
# To ensure numeric treatment of a hexadecimal literal, use it in numeric context.
# Ways to do this include adding 0 or using CAST(--- AS UNSIGNED)
#
# For example, a hexadecimal literal assigned to a user-defined variable is a binary string
# by default.
#
# To assign the value as a number, use it in numeric context:
#
# 		SET @v1 = X'41';
# 		SET @v2 = X'41'+0;
# 		SET @v3 = CAST(X'41' AS UNSIGNED);
# 		SELECT @v1, @v2, @v3;
# 		+--------+---------+----------+
# 		| @v1 	| @v2 	 | @v3 		|
# 		+--------+---------+----------+
# 		| A 		| 65 		 | 65 		|
# 		+--------+---------+----------+
#
# An empty hexadecimal value (X'') evaluates to a zero-length binary string.
# Converted to a number, it produces 0:
#
# 		SELECT CHARSET(X''), LENGTH(X'');
# 		+--------------------+-----------------+
# 		| CHARSET(X'') 		| LENGTH(X'') 	   |
# 		+--------------------+-----------------+
# 		| binary 				| 				0 		|
# 		+--------------------+-----------------+
#
# 		SELECT X''+0;
# 		+------------+
# 		| X''+0 	    |
# 		+------------+
# 		| 0 			 |
# 		+------------+
#
# The X'val' notation is based on standard SQL. The 0x notation is based on ODBC, for which hexadecimal strings
# are often used to supply values for BLOB columns.
#
# To convert a string or a number to a string in hexadecimal format, use teh HEX() function:
#
# 		SELECT HEX('cat');
# 		+-------------------+
# 		| HEX('cat') 		  |
# 		+-------------------+
# 		| 636174  			  |
# 		+-------------------+
#
# 		SELECT X'636174';
# 		+----------------+
# 		| X'636174' 	  |
# 		+----------------+
# 		| cat 			  |
# 		+----------------+
#
# For hexadecimal literals, bit operations are considered numeric context, but bit operations permit numeric
# or binary string arguments in MySQL 8.0 and higher.
#
# To explicitly specify binary string context for hexadecimal literals, use a _binary introducer for at least
# one of the arguments:
#
# 		SET @v1 = X'000D' | X'0BC0';
# 		SET @v2 = _binary X'000D' | X'0BC0';
# 		SELECT HEX(@v1), HEX(@v2);
#
# 		+------------+---------------+
# 		| HEX(@v1) 	 | HEX(@v2) 	  |
# 		+------------+---------------+
# 		| BCD 		 | 0BCD 			  |
# 		+------------+---------------+
#
# The displayed result appears similar for both bit operations, but the result without 
# _binary is a BIGINT, whereas the result with _binary is a binary string.
#
# Due to the difference in result types, the displayed values differ:
#
# High-order 0 digits are not displayed for the numeric result.
#
# BIT-VALUE LITERALS
#
# Bit-value literals are written using b'val' or 0bval notation.
#
# val is a binary value written using zeros and ones.
# Lettercase of any leading b does not matter.
#
# A leading 0b is case sensitive and cannot be written as 0B.
#
# Legal bit value literals:
#
# 		b'01'
# 		B'01'
# 		0b01
#
# Illegal bit-value literals:
#
# 		b'2' 		(2 is not a binary digit)
# 		0b01 		(0B must be written as 0b)
#
# By default, a bit-value literal is a binary string:
#
# 		SELECT b'1000001', CHARSET(b'1000001');
# 		+---------------+----------------------+
# 		| b'1000001' 	 | CHARSET(b'1000001') 	|

#
# A bit-value literal may have an optional character set introducer and COLLATE clause, to designate it

# NULL VALUES
#
# The NULL value means "no data". NULL can be written in any lettercase.

#
# For more information, see SECTION B.5.4.3, "PROBLEMS WITH NULL VALUES"
#
# For text file import or export operations performed with LOAD_DATA_INFILE or

#
# SCHEMA OBJECT NAMES
#
# Certain objects within MySQL, include database, table, index, column, alias, view, stored procedure,
# partition, tablespace, resource group and other object names are known as identifiers.
#
# This section describes the permissible syntax for identifiers in MySQL. 
#
# SECTION 9.2.2, "IDENTIFIER CASE SENSITIVITY", describes which types of identifiers are case-sensitive
# and under what conditions.
#
# An identifier may be quoted or unquoted.
#
# If an identifier contains special characters or is a reserved word, you MUST quote it whenever you refer ot it.
# (Exception: A reserved word that follows a period in a qualified name must be an identifier, so it need not be quoted)
#
# Reserved words are listed at SECTION 9.3 "KEYWORDS AND RESERVED WORDS"
#
# Identifiers are converted to Unicode internally.
# They may contain these characters:
#
# 		) Permitted characters in unquoted identifiers:
#
# 			) ASCII: [0-9,a-z,A-Z$_] (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, dollar, underscore)
#
# 			) Extended: U+0080 -- U+FFFF
#
# 		) Permitted characters in quoted identifiers include the full Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), except U+0000:
#
# 			) ASCII: U+0001 -- U+007F
# 
# 			) Extended: U+0080 -- U+FFFF
#
# 		) ASCII NUL (U+0000) and supplementary characters (U+10000 and higher) are not permitted in quoted or unquoted identifiers.
#
# 		) Identifiers may begin with a digit but unless quoted may not consist solely of digits.
#
# 		) Database, table and column names cannot end with space characters
#
# THe identifier quote character is the backtick (`):
#
# 		SELECT * FROM `select` WHERE `select`.id > 100;
#
# If the ANSI_QUOTES SQL mode is enabled, it is also permissible to quote identifiers within double quotation marks:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE "test" (col INT);
# 		ERROR 1064: You have an error in your SQL syntax ---
# 		SET sql_mode='ANSI_QUOTES';
# 		CREATE TABLE "test" (col INT);
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# The ANSI_QUOTES mode causes the server to interpret double-quoted strings as identifiers.
#
# Consequently, when this mode is enabled, string literals must be enclosed within single quotation marks.
# They cannot be enclosed within double quotation marks.
#
# The server SQL mode is controlled as described earlier.
#
# Identifier quote characters can be included within an identifier if you quote the identifier.
#
# If the character to be included within the identifier is the same as that used to quote the
# identifier itself, then you need to double the character.
#
# The following statement creates a table named a`b that contains a column named c"d:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE `a``b` (`c"d` INT);
#
# In the select list of a query, a quoted column alias can be specified using identifier
# or string quoting characters:
#
# 		SELECT 1 AS `one`, 2 AS 'two';
# 		+----------+---------+
# 		| one 	  | two 	   |
# 		+----------+---------+
# 		| 1 		  | 2 		|
# 		+----------+---------+
#
# Elsewhere in the statement, quoted references to the alias must use identifier quoting or the reference
# is treated as a string literal.
#
# IT is recommended that you do not use names that begin with Me or MeN, where M and N are integers.
#
# For example, avoid using 1e as an identifier, because an expression such as 1e+3 is ambiguous.
#
# Depending on context, it might be interpreted as the expression 1e + 3 or as the number 1e+3
#
# Be careful when using MD5() to produce table names because it can produce names in illegal or
# ambiguous formats such as those just described.
#
# A user variable cannot be used directly in an SQL statement as an identifier or as part of an
# identifier.
#
# See SECTION 9.4, "USER-DEFINED VARIABLES", for more information and examples of workarounds.
#
# Special characters in database and table names are encoded in the corresponding file system names
# as described in section 9.2.3, "MAPPING OF IDENTIFIERS TO FILE NAMES"
#
# The following table describes the maximum length for each type of identifier.
#
# 				Identifier Type 							Maximum Length (characters)
#
# 	Database 									64 (NDB storage engine: 63)
#
# 	Table 										64 (NDB storage engine: 63)
#
# 	Column 										64
#
# 	Index 										64
#
# 	Constraint 									64
#
# 	Stored Program 							64
#
# 	View 											64
#
# 	Tablespace 									64
#
# 	Server 										64
#
# 	Log File Group 							64
#
# 	Alias 										256 (see exception following table)
#
# 	Compound Statement Label 				16
#
# 	User-Defined Variable 					64
#
# 	Resource Group 							64
#
# Aliases for column names in CREATE_VIEW statements are checked against the maxium
# column length of 64 characters (not the maximum alias length of 256 characters)
#
# Identifiers are stored using Unicode (UTF-8)
#
# THis applies to identifiers in table definitions and to identifiers stored in the 
# grant tables in the mysql database.
#
# The sizes of the identifier string columns in the grant tables are measured in characters.
#
# You can use multibyte characters without reducing the number of characters permitted for values
# stored in these columns.
#
# As indicated earlier, the permissible Unicode characters are those in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
#
# Supplementary characters are not permitted.
#
# NDB Cluster imposes a maximum length of 63 characters for names of databases and tables.
# See SECTION 22.1.6.5 "LIMITS ASSOCIATED WITH DATABASE OBJECTS IN NDB CLUSTER"
#
# IDENTIFIER QUALIFIERS
#
# Object names may be unqualified or qualified.
#
# An unqualified name is permitted in contexts where interpretation of the name is unambiguous.
#
# A qualified name includes at least one qualifier to clarify the interpretive context by overriding
# a default context or providing missing context.
#
# For example, this statement creates a table using the unqualified name t1:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT);
#
# Because t1 includes no qualifier to specify a database, the statement creates the table in the default database.
# If there is no default database, an error occurs.
#
# This statement creates a table using the qualified name db1.t1:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE db1.t1 (i INT);
#
# Because db1.t1 includes a database qualifier db1, the statement creates t1 in the database named db1,
# regardless of the default database.
#
# The qualifier MUST be specified if there is no default database.
#
# THe qualifier MAY be specified if there is a default database, to specify a database different from the
# default, or to make the database explicit if the default is the same as the one specified.
#
# Qualifiers have these characteristics:
#
# 		) An unqualified name consists of a single identifier. A qualified name consists of multiple identifiers.
#
# 		) The components of a multiple-part name must be separated by period (.) characters.
#
# 			The initial parts of a multiple-part name act as qualifiers that affect the context
# 			within which to interpret the final identifier.
#
# 		) The qualifier character is a separate token and need not be contiguous with the associated identifiers.
#
# 			For example, tbl_name.col_name and tbl_name . col_name are equivalent
#
# 		) If any components of a multiple-part name require quoting, quote them individually rather than quoting the name as a whole.
#
# 			For example, write `my-table`.`my-column`, not `my-table.my-column`
#
# 		) A reserved word that follows a period in a qualified name must be an identifier, so in that context it need not be quoted.
#
# The permitted qualifiers for object names depend on the object type:
#
# 		) A database name is fully qualified and takes no qualifier:
#
# 			CREATE DATABASE db1;
#
# 		) A table view, or stored program name may be given a database-name qualifier.
# 			Examples of unqualified and qualified names in CREATE statements:
#
# 			CREATE TABLE mytable ---;
# 			CREATE VIEW myview ---;
# 			CREATE PROCEDURE myproc ---;
# 			CREATE FUNCTION myfunc ---;
# 			CREATE EVENT myevent ---;
#
# 			CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable ---;
# 			CREATE VIEW mydb.myview ---;
# 			CREATE PROCEDURE mydb.myproc ---;
# 			CREATE FUNCTION mydb.myfunc ---;
# 			CREATE EVENT mydb.myevent ---;
#
# 		) A trigger is associated with a table, so any qualifier applies to the table name:
#
# 			CREATE TRIGGER mytrigger --- ON mytable ---;
#
# 			CRAETE TRIGGER mytrigger --- ON mydb.mytable ---;
#
# 		) A column name may be given multiple qualifiers to indicate context in statements that reference it,
# 			as shown in the following table.
#
# 			COLUMN REFERENCE 							MEANING
#
# 			col_name 									Column col_name from whichever table used in the statement contains a column of that name
#
# 			tbl_name.col_name 						Column col_name from table tbl_name of the default database
#
# 			db_name.tbl_name.col_name 				Column col_name from table tbl_name of the database db_name
#
# 			IN other words, a column name may be given a table-name qualifier, which itself may be given a database-name qualifier.
#
# 			Examples of unqualified and qualified column references in SELECT statements:
#
# 				SELECT c1 FROM mytable
# 				WHERE c2 > 100;
#
# 				SELECT mytable.c1 FROM mytable
# 				WHERE mytable.c2 > 100;
#
# 				SELECT mydb.mytable.c1 FROM mydb.mytable
# 				WHERE mydb.mytable.c2 > 100;
#
# YOu need not specify a qualifier for an object reference in a statement unless the unqualified reference is ambiguous.
#
# Suppose that column c1 occurs only in table t1, c2 only in t2 and c in both t1 and t2.
#
# Any unqualified reference to c is ambiguous in a statement that refers to both tables and must be qualified
# as t1.c or t2.c to indicate which table you mean:
#
# 		SELECT c1, c2, t1.c FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2
# 		WHERE t2.c > 100;
#
# SImilarly, to retrieve from a table t in database db1 and from a table t in database db2 in the same statement,
# you must qualify the table references:
#
# FOr references to columns in those tables, qualifiers are required only for column names that appear in both tables.
#
# SUppose that column c1 occurs only in table db1.t, c2 only in db2.t and c in both db1.t and db2.t
#
# In this case, c is ambiguous and must be qualified but c1 and c2 need not be:
#
# 		SELECT c1, c2, db1.t.c FROM db1.t INNER JOIN db2.t
# 		WHERE db2.t.c > 100;
#
# Table aliases enable qualified column references to be written more simply:
#
# 		SELECT c1, c2, t1.c FROM db1.t AS t1 INNER JOIN db2.t AS t2
# 		WHERE t2.c > 100;
#
# IDENTIFIER CASE SENSITIVITY
#
# In MySQL, databases correspond to directories within the data directory. Each table within a DB corresponds to
# at least one file within the DB directory (and possibly more, depending on the storage engine)
#
# Triggers also correspond to files. Consequently, the case sensitivity of the underlying OS plays a part in the
# case sensitivity of database, table and trigger names.
#
# This means such names are not case-sensitive in Windows, but are case-sensitive in most varieties of Unix.
#
# One notable exception is macOS, which is Unix-based but uses a default file system (HFS+) that is not case-sensitive.
#
# However, macOS also supports UFS volumes, which are case-sensitive just as on any Unix.
#
# The lower_case_table_names system variable also affects how the server handles identifier case sensitivity,
# as described later in this section.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		Although database, table and trigger names are not case sensitive on some platforms, you should not refer
# 		to one of these using different cases within the same statement.
#
# 		The following statement would not work because it refers to a table both as my_table and as MY_TABLE:
#
# 			SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE MY_TABLE.col=1;
#
# COlumn, index, stored routine, event and resource group names are not case-sensitive on any platform, nor are column aliases.
#
# However, names of logfile groups are case-sensitive. This differs from standard SQL.
#
# By default, table aliases are case-sensitive on Unix, but not so on Windows or macOS.
#
# The following statement would not work on Unix, because it refers to the alias both as a and as A:
#
# 		SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name AS a
# 		WHERE a.col_name = 1 OR A.col_name = 2;
#
# however, this statement is permitted on Windows.
#
# To avoid problems caused by such differences, it is best to adopt a consistent convention, such as always
# creating and referring to databases and tables using lowercase names.
#
# This convention is recommended for maxmimum portability and ease of use.
#
# How table and database names are stored on disk and used in MySQL is affected by the lower_case_table_names system variable.
#
# Lower_case_table_names can take the values shown soon.
#
# This variable does NOT affect case sensitivity of trigger identifiers. On Unix, the default value of lower_case_table_names is 0.
#
# On Windows, it is 1. On macOS, it's 2.
#
# lower_case_table_name can only be configured when intializing the server.
# Changing the lower_case_table_names setting after the server is initialized is prohibited.
#
# 	Value 				Meaning
#
# 0 			Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the CREATE_TABLE or CREATE_DATABSE statement.
# 				Name comparisons are case sensitive.
#
# 				You should NOT set this variable to 0 if you are running MySQL on a system that has case-insensitive file names
# 				(Such as Windows or macOS).
#
# 				If you force this variable to 0 with --lower-case-table-names=0 on a case-insensitive file system and access MyISAM
# 				tablenames using different lettercases, and index corruption may result.
#
# 1 			Table names are stored in lowercase on disk and name comparisons are not case-sensitive.
#
# 				MySQL converts all table names to lowercase on storage and lookup.
#
# 				This behavior also applies to database names and table aliases.
#
# 2 			Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the CREATE_TABLE or
# 				CREATE_DATABASE statement, but MySQL converts them to lowercase on lookup.
#
# 				Name comparisons are not case sensitive.
#
# 				This works ONLY on file systems that are not case-sensitive.
#
# 				InnoDB table names and view names are stored in lowercase, as for lower_case_table_names=1
#
# If you are using MySQL on only one platform, you do not normally have to use a lower_case_table_names setting
# other than the default.
#
# However, you may encounter difficulties if you want to transfer tables between platforms that differ in file system
# case sensitivity.
#
# For example, on Unix, you can have two different tables named my_table and MY_TABLE.
#
# But on Windows, these two names are considered identical. To avoid data transfer problems arising from
# lettercase of database or table names, you have two options:
#
# 		) Use lower_case_table_names=1 on all systems. The main disadvantage with this is that when you use SHOW_TABLES
# 			or SHOW_DATABASES, you do not see the names in their original lettercase.
#
# 		) Use lower_case_table_names=0 on Unix and lower_case_table_names=2 on Windows.
#
# 			This preserves the lettercase of database and table names. 
#
# 			The disadvantage of this is that you must ensure that your statements always refer to
# 			your DB and table names with the correct lettercase on WIndows. 
 
 # 		If you transfer yourr statements to UNix, where lettercase is signifgicant,.
 # 		they do not work if the lettercase is incorrect.
 #
 # 		Exception:
 #
 # 			If you are using InnoDB tables and you are trying to avoid these data transfer problems,
 # 			you should use lower_case_table_names=1 on all platforms to force names to be converted to lowercase.
 #
 # object names may be considered duplicates if their uppercase forms are equal according to a binary collation.
 #
 # That is true for names of cursors, conditions, procedures, functions, savepoints, stored routine parameters,
 # stored program local variables, and plugins.
 #
 # It is not true for names of columns, constraints, databases, partitions, statements prepared with PREPARE,
 # tables, triggers, users and user-defined variables.
 #
 # File system case sensitivity can affect searches in string columns of INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.
 # for more information, see SECTION 10.8.7, "USING COLLATION IN INFORMATION_SCHEMA SEARCHES"
 #
 # MAPPING OF IDENTIFIERS TO FILE NAMES
 #
 # There is a correspondance between database and table identifiers and names in the file system.
 #
 # For the basic structure, MySQL represents each database as a directory in the data directory,
 # and depending upon the storage engine, each table may be represented by one or more files in the
 # appropriate database directory.
 #
 # For the data and index files, the exact representation on disk is storage engine specific.
 #
 # These files may be stored in the database directory, or the information may be stored in a 
 # separate file.
 #
 # InnoDB data is stored in the InnoDB data files.
 #
 # If you are using tablespaces with InnoDB, then the specific tablespace file you create are used
 # instead.
 #
 # ANy character is legal in database or table identifiers, except ASCII NUL (X'00')
 #
 # MysQL encodes any characters that are problematic in the corresponding file system objects
 # when it creates DB directories or table files:
 #
 # 		) Basic latin letters (a--zA--Z), digits (0--9) and underscore (_) are encoded as is.
 #
 # 			Consequently, their case sensitivity directly depends on file system features.
 #
 # 		) All other national letters from alphabets that have uppercase/lowercase mapping are encoded 
 # 			as shown in the following table.
 #
 # 			values in the code range column are USC-2 values.
 #
 # 			Code Range 			Pattern 				Number 			Used 		UNused 		Blocks
 #
 # 			00C0--017F 			[@[0--4][g--z] 	5*20=100 		97 		3 				Latin-1 Supplement + Latin Extended-A

 #
 # 			24B6--24E9 			[@][@][a--z] 		26 				26 		0 				Enclosed Alphanumerics
 #
 # 			FF21--FF5A 			[@][a--z][@] 		26 				26 		0 				Halfwidth and Fullwidth forms
 #
 # One of the bytes in the sequence encodes lettercase.
 #
 # For example: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE is encoded as @0G, whereas LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH GRAVE is encoded as @0g.
 #
 # Here the third byte (G or g) indicates lettercase. (On a case-insensitive file system, both letters will be treated as the same)
 #
 # For some blocks, such as Cyrllilic, the second byte determines lettercase.
 #
 # For other blocks, such as Latin1 Supplement, the third byte determines lettercase.
 #
 # If two bytes in the sequence are letters (as in Greek Extended), the leftmost letter character
 # stands for lettercase.
 #
 # All other letter bytes must be in lowercase.
 #
 # 	) All nonletter characters except underscore (_), as well as letters from alphabets that do not have uppercase/lowercase mapping
 # 		(such as Hebrew) are encoded using hexadecimal representations using lowercase letters for hexadecimal digits a--f:
 #
 # 			0x003F -> @003f
 # 			0xFFFF -> @ffff
 #
 # 		The hexadecimal values correspond to character values in usc2 double-byte character set.
 #
 # On Windows, some names such as nul, prn and aux are encoded by appending @@@ to the name when the server
 # creates the corresponding file or directory.
 #
 # This occurs on all platforms for portability of the corresponding database object between platforms.
 #
 # FUNCTION NAME PARSING AND RESOLUTION
 #
 # MySQL supports built-in (native) functions, user-defined functions (UDFs), and stored functions.
 #
 # This section describes how the server recognizes whether the name of a built-in function is used as
 # a function call or as an identifier, and how the server determines which function to use in cases when
 # functions of different types exists with a given name.
 #
 # BUILT-IN FUNCTION NAME PARSING
 #
 # THe parser uses default rules for parsing names of built-in functions.
 #
 # these rules can be changed by enabling the IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode.
 #
 # When the parser encounters a word that is the name of a built-in function, it must determines whether the
 # name signifies a function call or instead a nonexpression reference to an identifier such as table or column name.
 #
 # For example, in the following statements, the first reference to count is a function call, whereas the second
 # reference is a table name:
 #
 # 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;
 # 		CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
 #
 # THe parser should recognize the name of a built-in function as indicating a function call only
 # when parsing what is expected to be an expression.
 #
 # That is, in nonexpression context, function names are permitted as identifiers.
 #
 # However, some built-in functions have special parsing or implementation considerations,
 # so the parser uses the following rules by default to distinguish whether their names are being
 # used as function calls or as identifiers in nonexpression context:
 #
 # 		) To use the name as a function call in an expression, there must be no whitespace between the name and the following ( paranthesis character.
 #
 # 		) Conversely, to use the function name as an identifier, it must not be followed immediately by a paranthesis.
 #
 # The requirement that function calls be written with no whitespace between the name and the parenthesis applies only to
 # the built-in functions that have special considerations.
 #
 # COUNT is one such name.
 #
 # THe sql/lex.h source file lists the names of these special functions for which the following whitepace determines
 # their interpretation:
 #
 # names defined by the SYM_FN() macro in the symbols[] array
 #
 # The following list names teh functions in MySQl >= 8.0 that are affected by the IGNORE_SPACE
 # setting and listed as special in the sql/lex.h source file
 #
 # You may find it easiest to treat the no-whitespace requirement as applying to all function calls:
 #
 # 		) ADDDATE
 #
 # 		) BIT_AND
 #
 # 		) BIT_OR
 #
 # 		) BIT_XOR
 #
 # 		) CAST
 #
 # 		) COUNT
 #
 # 		) CURDATE
 #
 # 		) CURTIME
 #
 # 		) DATE_ADD
 #
 # 		) DATE_SUB
 #
 # 		) EXTRACT
 #
 # 		) GROUP_CONCAT
 #
 # 		) MAX
 #
 # 		) MID
 #
 # 		) MIN
 #
 # 		) NOW
 #
 # 		) POSITION
 #
 # 		) SESSION_USER
 #
 # 		) STD
 #
 # 		) STDDEV
 #
 # 		) STDDEV_POP
 #
 # 		) STDDEV_SAMP
 #
 # 		) SUBDATE
 #
 # 		) SUBSTR
 #
 # 		) SUM
 #
 # 		) SYSDATE
 #
 # 		) SYSTEM_USER
 #
 # 		) TRIM
 #
 # 		) VARIANCE
 #
 # 		) VAR_POP
 #
 # 		) VAR_SAMP
 #
 # For functions not listed as special in sql/lex.h, whitespace does not matter.
 #
 # They are interpreted as function calls only when used in expression context and may be used
 # freely as identifiers otherwise.
 #
 # ASCII is one such name.
 #
 # However, for these nonaffected function names, interpretation may vary in expression context:
 #
 # 		func_name		() 
 #
 # is interpreted as a built-in function if there is one with the given name; if not, func_name 		() is interpreted
 # as a user-defined function or stored function if one exists with that name.
 #
 # The IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode can be used to modify how the parser treats function names that are whitespace-sensitive:
 #
 # 	) With IGNORE_SPACE disabled, the parser interprets the name as a function call when there is no whitespace between
 # 		the name nad the following paranthesis.
 #
 # 		This occurs even when the function name is used in nonexpression context:
 #
 # 			CREATE TABLE count(i INT);
 # 			ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax ---
 # 			near 'count(i INT)'
 #
 # 		To eliminate the error and cause the name to be treated as an identifier, either use whitespace following the name
 # 		or write it as a quoted identifier (or both):
 #
 # 			CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
 # 			CREATE TABLE `count`(i INT);
 # 			CREATE TABLE `count`  (i INT);
#
# 		) WIth IGNORE_SPACE enabled, the parser loosens the requriements that there be no whitespace between the function
# 			name and the following paranthesis.
#
# 			This provides more flexibility in writing function calls.
#
# 		For example, either of the following function calls are legal:
#
# 			SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;
# 			SELECT COUNT (*) FROM mytable;
#
# 		However, enabling IGNORE_SPACE also has the side effect that hte parser treats the affected
# 		function names as reserved words (see SECTION 9.3, "KEYWORDS AND RESERVED WORDS")
#
# 		This means that a space following the name no longer singifies its use as an identifer.
#
# 		The name can be used in function calls with or without following whitespace, but causes a syntax
# 		error in nonexpression context unless it is quoted.
#
# 		For example, with IGNORE_SPACE enabled, both of hte following statements fail
# 		with a syntax error because the parser interprets count as a reserved word:
#
# 			CREATE TABLE count(i INT);
# 			CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
#
# 		To use the function name in nonexpression context, write it as a quoted identifier:
#
# 			CREATE TABLE `count`(i INT);
# 			CREATE TABLE `count` (i INT);
#
# To enable the IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode, use this statement:
#
# 		SET sql_mode = 'IGNORE_SPACE';
#
# IGNORE_SPACE is also enabled by certain other composite modes such as ANSI that include it in their value:
#
# 		SET sql_mode = 'ANSI';
#
# Check Server SQL modes for more info to see which composite mode enables IGNORE_SPACE.
#
# To minimize the dpeendency of SQL code on the IGNORE_SPACE setting, use these guidelines:
#
# 		) Avoid creating UDFs or stored functions that have the same name as a built in function.
#
# 		) Avoid using function names in nonexpression context.
#
# 			For example, these statements use count (one of hte affected function names affected by IGNORE_SPACE)
# 			so they fail with or without whitespace following the name if IGNORE_SPACE is enabled:
#
# 				CREATE TABLE count(i INT);
# 				CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
#
# 			If  you must use a function name in a nonexpression context, write it as a quoted identifier:
#
# 				CREATE TABLE `count`(i INT);
# 				CREATE TABLE `count` (i INT);
#
# FUNCTION NAME RESOLUTION
#
# The following rules describe hwo the server references to function names for function creation and invocation:
#
# 		) Built-in functions and user-defined functions
#
# 			An error occurs if you try to create a UDF with the same name as a built-in function.
#
# 		) Built-in functions and stored functions
#
# 			It is possible to create a stored function with the same name as a built-in function, but to invoke the
# 			stored function it is necessary to qualify it with a schema name.
#
# 			FOr example, if you created a store function named PI in the test schema, invoke it as test.PI()
# 			because the server resolves PI() without a qualifier as a reference to the built-in function.
#
# 			The server generates a warning if the stored function name collides with a built-in function name.
#
# 			The warning can be displayed with SHOW_WARNINGS.
#
# 		) User-defined functions and stored functions
#
# 			USer-defined functions and stored functions share the same namespace, so you cannot create a UDF and a stored function with the same name.
#
# 		The preceding function name resolution rules have implications for upgrading to versions of MySQL that implement new built-in functions:
#
# 			) IF you have already created a user-defined function with a given name and upgrade MySQL to a version that implements
# 				a new built-in function with the same name, the UDF becomes inaccessible.
#
# 				To correct this, use DROP_FUNCTION to drop the UDF and CREATE_FUNCTION to re-create the UDF with a different
# 				nonconflicitng name.
#
# 				Then modify any affected code to use the new name.
#
# 			) If a new version of MysQL implements a built-in function wih the same name as an existing stored function,
# 				you have two choices:
#
# 				Rename the stored function to use a noncflicting name
#
# 				or
#
# 				change calls to the function so that they use a schema qualifier (that is, use schema_name.func_name() syntax)
#
# 				In either case, modify any affected code accordingly.
#
# KEYWORDS AND RESERVED WORDS
#
# Keywords are words that have significance in SQL.
#
# Certain keywords, such as SELECT, DELETE or BIGINT, are reserved and require special treatment for use as identifiers
# such as table and column names.
#
# THis may also be ture for hte name of built-in functions.
#
# Nonreserved keywords are permitted as identifiers without quoting.
#
# Reserved words are permitted as identifiers if you quote them as described in SECTION 9.2 "SCHEMA OBJECT NAMES"
#
# 		CREATE TABLE interval (begin INT, end INT);
# 		ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL synytax ---
# 		near 'interval' (begin INT, end INT)'
#
# BEGIN and END are keywords, but not reserved.

# Thus, their use as identifiers does not require quoting:
# Interval is a reserved keyword and must be quoted to be used as an identifier:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE `interval` (begin INT, end INT);
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
#
# Exception: A word that follows a period in a qualified name must be an identifier, so it need not be quoted
# even if it is reserved:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE mydb.interval (begin INT, end INT);
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
#
# Names of built-in functions are permitted as identifiers but may require care to be used as such.
# For example, COUNT is acceptable as a column name.
#
# However, by default, no whitespace is permitted in function invocations between the function name
# and the following ( character.
#
# THis requirement enables the parser to distinguish whether the name is used in a function call
# or in nonfunction context.
#
# For further details on recognition of function names, see SECTION 9.2.4, "FUNCTION NAME PARSING AND RESOLUTION"
#
# The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEYWORDS table lists the words considered by MySQL and indicates whether
# tehy are reserved.
#
# See SECTION 25.13 "THE INFORMATION_SCHEMA KEYWORDS TABLE"
#
# MySQL 8.0 KEYWORDS AND RESERVERD WORDS
#
# The following lists shows the keywords and reserverd words in MySQL 8.0, along with the changes
# to individual words from verison to version.
#
# Reservered keywords are marked with (R).
#
# In addition, _FILENAME Is reserved.
#
# At some point, you might upgrade to a higehr version, so it is a good idea to have a look at future
# reserverd words, too.
#
# You can find these in the manuals that cover higher versions of MysQL.
#
# MOst of the reserved words in the list are forbidden by standard SQL as column or table names

# MYSQL 8.0 REMOVED KEYWORDS AND RESERVED WORDS
#
# The following lists the keywords and reserverd words that are removed in MySQL 8.0, compared to 5.7
#
# Reserved words are marked with (R)

#
# USER-DEFINED VARIABLES
#
# You can store a value in a user-defined variable in one statement and refer to it later in another statement.
#
# This enables you to pass values from one statement to another.
#
# User variables are written as @var_name, where the variable name var_name consists of alphanumeric characters, ., _, and $
#
# A user variable name can contain other characters if you quote it as a string or identifier (for example, @'my-var', @"my-var", or @`my-var`)
#
# User-defined variables are session specific. A user variable defined by one client cannot be seen or used by other clients.
# (Exception: A user with access to the Performance Schema user_variables_by_thread table can see all user variables for all sessions)
#
# All variables for a given client session are automatically freed when that client exits.
#
# User variable names are not case-sensitive. Names have a maximum length of 64 characters.
#
# One way to set a user-defined variable is by issuing a SET statement:
#
# 		SET @var_name = expr [, @var_name = expr] ---
#
# For SET, either = or := can be used as the assignment operator.
#
# User variables can be assigned a value from a limited set of data types: integer, decimal, floating-point, binary or nonbinary string, or NULL value.
#
# Assignment of decimal and real values does not preserve the precision of scale of the value.
#
# A value of a type other than one of the permissible types is converted to a permissible type.
# For example, a value having a temporal or spatial data type is converted to a binary string.
#
# A value having the JSON data type is converted to a string with a character set of utf8mb4 and a collation of utf8mb4_bin
#
# If a user variable is assigned a nonbinary (character) string value, it has the same character set and collation
# as the string.
#
# The coercibility of user variables is implicit.
#
# (This is the same coercibility as for table column values)
#
# HExadecimal or bit values assigned to user variables are treated as binary strings.
# To assign a hexadecimal or bit value as a number to a user variable, use it in numeric
# context.
#
# For example, add 0 or use CAST(--- AS UNSIGNED):
#
# 		SET @v1 = X'41';
# 		SET @v2 = X'41'+0;
# 		SET @v3 = CAST(X'41' AS UNSIGNED);
# 		SELECT @v1, @v2, @v3;
#
# 		+---------+----------+----------+
# 		| @v1 	 | @v2 	   | @v3 	  |
# 		+---------+----------+----------+
# 		| A 		 | 65 		| 65 		  |
# 		+---------+----------+----------+
#
# 
# 		SET @v1 = b'1000001';
# 		SET @v2 = b'1000001'+0;
# 		SET @v3 = CAST(b'1000001' AS UNSIGNED);
# 		SELECT @v1, @v2, @v3;
#
# 		+--------+----------+-------------+
# 		| @v1 	| @v2 	  | @v3 			 |
# 		+--------+----------+-------------+
# 		| A 		| 65 		  | 65 			 |

# If the value of a user variable is selected in a result set, it is returned ot hte client as a string.
#
# If you refer to a variable that has not been initialized, it has a value of NULL and a type of string.
#
# User variables may be used in most contexts where expressions are permitted.
#
# This does not currently include contexts that explicitly require a literal value, súch as in the
# LIMIT clause of a SELECT statement, or the IGNORE N LINES clause of a LOAD_DATA statement.
#
# Previous releases of MySQL made it possible to assign a value to a user variable in statements
# other than SET.
#
# This functionality is supported in MySQL 8.0 for backward compatbility but is subject to removal
# in a future release of MySQL.
#
# WHen making an assignment in this way, you muse use := as the assignment operator, = is treated as
# a comparison operator in statments other than SET.
#
# The order of evaluation of expressions involving user variables is undefined.
#
# For example, there is no guarantee that SELECT @a, @a:=@a+1 evaluates @a first and then performs the assignment.   
#
# In addition, the default result type of a variable is based on tis type at the beginning of the statement.
#
# THis may have unintended effects if a variable holds a value of one type at the beginning
# of a statement in which it is also assigned a new value of a different type.
#
# To avoid problems with this behavior, either do not assign a value to and read the value of the same variable
# within a single statement, or else set the variable to 0, 0.0 or '' to define its type before you use it.
#
# HAVING, GROUP BY and ORDER BY, when referring to a variable that is assigned a value in the select expression
# list do not owkr as expected because the expression is evaluated on the client and thus can use stale column values
# from a previous row.
#
# User variables are intended to provide data values. They cannot be used directly in an SQL statement as an identifier
# or as part of an identifier, such as in contexts where a table or database name is expected, or as a reserved word such as SELECT.
#
# This is true even if the variable is quoted, as shown in the following example:
#
# 		SELECT c1 FROM t;
# 		+-------+
# 		| c1 	  |
# 		+-------+
# 		| 0 	  |
# 		+-------+
# 		| 1 	  |
# 		+-------+
# 		2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
# 		
# 		SET @col = "c1";
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 		SELECT @col FROM t;
# 		+--------+
# 		| @col 	|
# 		+--------+
# 		| c1 	   |
# 		+--------+
# 		1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#
# 		SELECT `@col` FROM t;
# 		ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column '@col' in 'field list'
#
# 		SET @col = "`c1`";
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 		SELECT @col FROM t;
# 		+--------+
# 		| @col   |
# 		+--------+
# 		| `c1`	|
# 		+--------+
# 		1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#
# An exception to this principle that user variables cannot be used to provide identifiers, is when you
# are constructing a string for use as a prepared statement to execute later.
#
# In this case, user variables can be used to provide any part of the statement.
# The following example illustrates how this can be done:
#
# 		SET @c = "c1";
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 		SET @s = CONCAT("SELECT", @c, " FROM t");
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# 		PREPARE stmt FROM @s;
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
# 		Statement prepared
#
# 		EXECUTE stmt;
# 		+------+
# 		| c1   |
# 		+------+
# 		| 0 	 |
# 		+------+
# 		| 1 	 |
# 		+------+
# 		2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#
# 		DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
# 		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
#
# See SECTION 13.5, "PREPARED SQL STATEMENT SYNTAX" for more information.
#
# A similar technique can be used in application programs to construct SQL statements using
# program variables, as shown here:
#
# <?PHP
# 		$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "user", "pass", "test");
#
# 		if( mysqli_connect_errno()) )
# 			die("Connection failed: %s\n", mysql_connect_error());
#
# 		$col = "c1";
#
# 		$query = "SELECT $col FROM t";
#
# 		$result = $mysqli->query($query);
#
# 		while($row = $result->fetch_assoc())
# 		{
# 			echo "<p>" . $row["$col"] . "</p>\n";
# 		}
#
# 		$result->close();
#
# 		$mysqli->close();
# ?>
#
# Assembling SQL like this, can be called Dynamic SQL.

# EXPRESSIONS
#
# This section lists the grammar rules that expressions must follow in MySQL and provides additional

#
# EXPRESSION SYNTAX
#
# The following grammar rules define expression syntax in MySQL.

#
# For operator precedence, see SECTION 12.3.1, "OPERATOR PRECEDENCE".
#
# The precedence and meaning of some operators depends on the SQL mode:
#
# 		) By default || is a logical OR operator. WIth PIPES_AS_CONCAT enabled, || is string concatenation,
# 			with a precedence between ^ and the unary operators.
#
# 		) By default, ! has a higher precedence than NOT. With HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE enabled, ! and NOT have teh same precedence.

# MySQL permits any punctuation delimiter in the expr format.
# THose shown in the table ar the suggested delimiters.
#
# Temporal intervals are used for certain functions, such as DATE_ADD() and DATE_SUB():
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2018-05-01', INTERVAL 1 DAY);
# 			-> '2018-05-02'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_SUB('2018-05-01', INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
# 			-> '2017-05-01'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2020-12-31 23:59:59',
# 			-> 			 INTERVAL 1 SECOND);
# 				-> '2021-01-01 00:00:00'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2018-12-31 23:59:59',
# 			->				INTERVAL 1 DAY);
# 				-> '2019-01-01 23:59:59'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2100-12-31 23:59:59',
# 			-> 			INTERVAL '1:1' MINUTE_SECOND);
# 				-> '2101-01-01 00:01:00'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_SUB('2025-01-01 00:00:00'
# 			->				INTERVAL '1 1:1:1' DAY_SECOND);
# 		 		-> '2024-12-30 22:58:59'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('1900-01-01 00:00:00',
# 			-> 			INTERVAL '-1 10' DAY_HOUR);
# 				-> '1899-12-30 14:00:00'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_SUB('1998-01-02', INTERVAL 31 DAY);
# 			-> '1997-12-02'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('1992-12-31 23:59:59.000002',
# 			->			INTERVAL '1.999999' SECOND_MICROSECOND);
# 				-> '1993-01-01 00:00:01.00001'
#
# Temporal arithmetic also can be performed in expressions using INTERVAL together with the + or - operator:
#
# 	date + INTERVAL expr unit
# 	date - INTERVAL expr unit
#
# INTERVAL expr unit is permitted on either side of the + operator if the expression on the other side is a date
# or datetime value.
#
# For the - operator, INTERVAL expr unit is permitted only on the right side, because it makes
# no sense to subtract date or datetime value from an interval.
#
# SELECT '2018-12-31 23:59:59' + INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
# 		-> '2019-01-01 00:00:00'
# SELECT INTERVAL 1 DAY + '2018-12-31';
# 		-> '2019-01-01'
# SELECT '2025-01-01' - INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
# 		-> '2024-12-31 23:59:59'
#
# The EXTRACT() function uses the same kinds of unit specifiers as DATE_ADD() or
# DATE_SUB(), but extracts parts from the date rather than performing date arithmetic:
#
# 		SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2019-07-02');
# 			-> 2019
#
# 		SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM '2019-07-02 01:02:03');
# 			-> 201907
#
# Temporal intervals can be used in CREATE_EVENT statements:
#
# 		CREATE EVENT myevent
# 			ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
# 			DO
# 				UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
#
# If you specify an interval value that is too short (does not include all the interval parts that would be expected
# from the unit keyword), MySQL assumes that you have left out the leftmost parts of the interval value.
#
# For example, if you specify a unit of DAY_SECOND, the value of expr is expected to have days, hours, minutes and
# seconds parts.
#
# If you specify a value like '1:10', MySQL assumes that the days and hours parts are missing and the value represents
# minutes and seconds.
#
# In other words, '1:10' DAY_SECOND is interpreted in such a way that is equivalent to '1:10' MINUTE_SECOND.
#
# This is analogous to the way that MySQL interprets TIME values as representing elapsed time rather than as
# a time of day.
#
# expr is treated as a string, so be careful if you specify a nonstring value with INTERVAL.
#
# FOr example, with a interval specifier of HOUR_MINUTE, '6/4' is treated as 6 hours, four minutes,
# whereas 6/4 evaluates to 1.5000 and is treated as 1 hour, 5000 minutes:
#
# 		SELECT '6/4', 6/4;
# 			-> 1.5000
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2019-01-01', INTERVAL '6/4' HOUR_MINUTE);
# 			-> '2019-01-01 06:04:00'
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2019-01-01', INTERVAL 6/4 HOUR_MINUTE);
# 			-> '2019-01-04 12:20:00'
#
# To ensure interpretation of the interval value as you expect, a CAST() operation may be used.
# To treat 6/4 as 1 hour 5 mins, cast it to a DECIMAL value with a single fractional digit:
#
# 		SELECT CAST(6/4 AS DECIMAL(3,1));
# 			-> 1.5
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('1970-01-01 12:00:00',
# 			->				 INTERVAL CAST(6/4 AS DECIMAL(3,1)) HOUR_MINUTE);
# 				-> '1970-01-01 13:05:00'
#
# If you add or subtract from a date value something that contains a time part,
# the result is automatically converted to a datetime value:
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2023-01-01', INTERVAL 1 DAY);
# 			-> '2023-01-02'
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2023-01-01', INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
# 			-> '2023-01-01 01:00:00'
#
# If you add MONTH, YEAR_MONTH, or YEAR and the resulting date has a day that is larger than
# the maximum day for the new month, the day is adjusted to the maximum days in the new month:
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2019-01-30', INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
# 			-> '2019-02-28'
#
# Date arithmetic operations require complete dates and do not work with incomplete date such as '2016-07-00' or badly
# malformed dates:
#
# 		SELECT DATE_ADD('2016-07-00', INTERVAL 1 DAY);
# 			-> NULL
# 		SELECT '2005-03-32' + INTERVAL 1 MONTH;
# 			-> NULL
#
# COMMENT SYNTAX
#
# MySQL Server supports three comment styles:
#
# 		) From a # character to end of line
#
# 		) From a -- sequence to the end of the line.
#
# 			In MySQL, the -- (double-dash) comment style requires the second dash to be followed by
# 			at least one whitespace or control character (such as space, tab, newline, and so on).
#
# 			This syntax differs slightly from standard SQL comment syntax, as discussed in earlier.
#
# 		) from a /* sequence to the following */ sequence, as in the C programming language.
#
# 			This syntax enables a comment to extend over multiple lines because the
# 			beginning and closing sequences need not be on the same line.
#
# THe following example demonstrates all three comment styles:
#
# 	SELECT 1+1; #This comment continues to end of line
# 	SELECT 1+1; -- same
# 	SELECT 1 /* inline comment */ + 1;
# 	SELECT 1+
# /*
# multiline 
# comment
# */
# 1;
#
# Nested comments are not supported, as they are dperecated.
#
# Under some conditions they are allowed, but usually not, thus, avoid them.
#
# MySQL server supports some variants of C-style comments.
#
# These enable you to write code that includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable,
# by using comments of the following form:
#
# /*! MySQL-specific code */
#
# In this case, MySQL parses and executes the code within the comment as it would any other SQL statement,
# but other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.
#
# For example, MySQL server recognizes the STRAIGHT_JOIN keyword in the following statment,
# but other servers will not:
#
# 		SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col1 FROM table1,table2 WHERE ---
#
# If you add a version number after the ! character, the syntax within the comment is executed
# only if the MySQl version is greater than or equal to the specified version
#
# The KEY_BLOCK_SIZE keyword in the following comment is executed only by servers from MySQL 5.1.10 or higher:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1(a INT, KEY (a)) /*! 50110 KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=1024 */;
#
# The comment syntax just described applies to how the mysql parses SQL statements.
#
# The MySQL client program also performs some parsing of statements before sending them to
# the server.
#
# (It does this to determine statement boundaries within a multiple-statement input line)
#
# Comments in this format /*!12345 --- */, are not stored on the server.
#
# If this format is used to comment stored routines, the comments will not be retained on
# the server.
#
# Another variant of C-style comment syntax is used to specify optimizer hints.
# Hint comments include a + character following the /* comment opening sequence.
#
# Example:
#
# 	SELECT /*+ BKA(t1) */ FROM ---;
#
# Fore more information, see SECTION 8.9.2, "OPTIMIZER HINTS"
#
# The use of short-form mysql commands such as \C within multiple line /* --- */ comments si not supported.
#
# CHARACTER SETS, COLLATIONS, UNICODE
#
# MySQL includes character set support that enables you to store data using a variety of character
# sets and perform comparsions according to a variety of collations.
#
# You can specify character sets at the server, database, table and column level.
#
# This chapter discusses the following topics:
#
# 		) What are character sets and collations?
#
# 		) The multiple-level default system for character set assignment.
#
# 		) Syntax for specifying character sets and collations
#
# 		) Affected functions and operations.
#
# 		) Unicode support.
#
# 		) The character sets and collations that are available with notes.
#
# 		) Selecting the language for error messages
#
# 		) Selecting the locale for day and month names
#
# Character set issues affect not only data storage, but also communication between client programs
# and the MySQL server.
#
# If you want the client program to communicate with the server using a character set different
# from the default, you'll need to indicate which one.
#
# For example, to use the utf8 unicode character set, issue this statement after connecting to the server:
#
# 		SET NAMES 'utf8';
#
# For more information about configuring character sets for application use and character set-related
# issues in client/server communication, see SECTION 10.5, "CONFIGURING APPLICATION CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION"
#
# SECTION 10.4, "CONNECTION CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS"
#
# CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS IN GENERAL
#
# A character set is a set of symbols and encodings.
# A collation is a set of rules for comparing characters in a character set.
#
# Let's make the distinction clear with an example of an imaginary char set.
#
# Suppose that we have an alphabet of four letters:
#
# 		A, B, a, b
#
# We give each letter a number:
#
# 		A = 0
#
# 		B = 1
#
# 		a = 2
#
# 		b = 3
#
# The letter A is the symbol, the number 0 is the encoding for A, and the combination
# of all four letters and their encodings is a character set.
#
# Suppose that we want to compare two string values, A and B.
#
# The simplest way to do this is to look at the encodings: 0 for A and 1 for B.
#
# Because 0 < 1, A is < B
#
# What we've just done thus, is to apply a collation to our character set.
# The collation set is a set of rules (only one rule in this case):
#
# 		"compare the encodings"
#
# We call this simplest of all possible collations a binary collation
#
# But what if we want to say that the lowercase and uppercase letters are equivalent?
# Then we would have at least two rules: 
#
# (1) treat the lowercase letter a and b as equivalent to A and B
#
# (2) then compare the encodings
#
# We call this a case-insensitive collation. It is a little more complex than a binary collation.
#
# In real life, most character sets have many characters: not just A and B but whole alphabets,
# sometimes multiple alphabets or eastern writing systems with thousands of characters, along with many
# special symbols and punctuation marks.
#
# Also in real life, most collations have many rules, not just for whether to distinguish
# lettercase, but also for whether to distinguish accents (an "accent" is a mark attached to a character
# as in a German Ö) and for multiple-character mappings (such as the rule that Ö = OE in one of the two
# german collations)
#
# MySQL can do these things for you:
#
# 		Store strings using a variety of character sets
#
# 		Compare strings using a variety of collations
#
# 		Mix strings with different character sets or collations in the same server,
# 		the same database, or even the same table
#
# 		Enable specification of character set and collation at any level
#
# To use these features effectively, you must know what character sets and collations
# are available, how to change the defaults, and how they affect the behavior of string operators
# and functions.
#
# CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS IN MYSQL
#
# MySQL Server supports multiple character sets, including several Unicode character sets.
#
# To display the available character sets, use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS table or the
# SHOW_CHARACTER_SET statement.
# 
# A partial listing follows. For more complete information, see SECTION 10.10 "SUPPORTED CHARACTER SETS
# AND COLLATIONS"
#
# SHOW CHARACTER SET;
# +------------+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------------+
# | Charset 	| Description 											| Default collation 	 	  | Maxlen 		 |
# +------------+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------------+
# | big5 		| Big5 Traditional Chinese 					   | big5_chinese_ci 		  | 		2 	 	 |
# | binary 	   | Binary pseudo charset 							| binary 					  | 		1 	    |
# ---
# | latin1 		| cp1252 West European 								| latin1_swedish_ci 		  | 		1 		 |

# | utf8mb4 	| UTF-8 Unicode 										| utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci 	  | 		4 		 |
# ---
#
# By default, the SHOW_CHARACTER_SET statement displays all available character sets.
#
# It takes an optional LIKE or WHERE clause that indicates which character set names to match.
#
# The following examples shows some of the Unicode character sets (those based on Unicode Transformation Format):
#
# 		SHOW CHARACTER SET LIKE 'utf%';

# A given character set always has at least one collation, and most character sets have several.
#
# To list the display collations for a character set, use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS table
# or the SHOW_COLLATION statement.
#
# By default, the SHOW_COLLATION statement displays all available collations.
#
# It takes an optional LIKE or WHERE clause that indicates which collation names to display. 
#
# For example, to see the collations for the default character set, utf8mb4, use this statement:
#
# SHOW COLLATION WHERE Charset = 'utf8mb4';

# 
# --- This carries on for all the different charsets ---
#
# For more information about those collations, see SECTION 10.10.1, "UNICODE CHARACTER SETS"
#
# Collations have these general characteristics:
#
# 		) Two different character sets cannot have the same collation
#
# 		) Each character set has a default collation.
#
# 			For example, the default collations for utf8mb4 and latin1 are utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci and latin1_swedish_ci, respectively.
#
# 			The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS table and the SHOW_CHARACTER_SET statement indicate hte default collation
# 			for each character set.
#
# 			The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS table and the SHOW_COLLATION statement have a column that indicates for each
# 			collation whether it is the default for its character set (yes if so, empty if not)
#
# 		) Collation names start with the name of the character set with which they are associated, generally followed
# 			by one or more suffixes indicating other collation characteristics.
#
# 			For additional information about naming conventions, see SECTION 10.3.1, "COLLATION NAMING CONVENTIONS"
#
# When a character set has multiple collations, it might not be clear which collation is most suitable for a given application.
#
# To avoid choosing an inappropriate collation, perform some comparisons with representative data values to make sure that a 
# given collation sorts values the way you expect.
#
# CHARACTER SET REPETOIRE
#
# The repetoire of a character set is the collection of characters in the set.
#
# String expressions have a repetoire attribute, which can have two values:
#
# 		) ASCII: The expression can contain only characters in the Unicode range U+0000 to U+007F
#
# 		) UNICODE: The expression can contain characters in the Unicode range U+0000 to U+10FFFF
#
# 						This includes characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) range (U+0000 to U+FFFF)
# 						and supplementary characters outside the BMP range (U+10000 to U+10FFFF)
#
# The ASCII range is a subset of UNICODE range, so a string with ASCII repetoire can be converted safely without
# loss of information to the character set of any string with UNICODE repetoire or to a character set that is
# a superset of ASCII.
#
# (All MYSQL character sets are supersets of ASCII with the exception of swe7, which reuses some punctuation
# 	characters for Swedish accented characters)
#
# The use of repetoire enables character set conversion in expressions for many cases where MySQL would
# otherwise return an "illegal mix of collations" error
#
# The following discussion provides examples of expressions and their repetoires, and describes how the use
# of repetoire changes string expression evaluation:
#
# 		) The repetoire for a string constant depends on string content and may differ from the repetoire of the string
# 			character set.
#
# 			Consider these statements:
#
# 				SET NAMES utf8; SELECT 'abc';
# 				SELECT _utf8'def';
# 				SELECT N'MySQL';
#
# 			Although the character set is utf8 in each of the preceding cases, the strings do not actually
# 			contain any characters outside the ASCII range, so their repetoire is ASCII rather than UNICODE.
#
# 		) A column having the ascii character set has ASCII repetoire because of its character set.
#
# 			In the following table, c1 has ASCII repetoire:
#
# 				CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET ascii);
#
# 			The following example illustrates how repetoire enables a result to be determined in a case where
# 			an error occurs without repetoire:
#
# 				CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 					c1 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET latin1,
# 					c2 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET ascii
# 				);
# 				INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('a', 'b');
# 				SELECT CONCAT(c1,c2) FROM t1;
#
# 			Without repetoire this error occurs:
#
# 				ERROR 1267 (HY000): Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci, IMPLICIT)
# 				and (ascii_general_ci, IMPLICIT) for operation 'concat'
#
# 			Using repetoire, subset to superset (ascii to latin1) conversion can occur and a result is returned:
#
# 				+-------------------+
# 				| CONCAT(c1,c2) 	  |
# 				+-------------------+
# 				| ab 					  |
# 				+-------------------+
#
# 		) Functions with one string argument inherit the repetoire of their argument.
#
# 			The result of UPPER( utf8'abc' ) has ASCII repetoire because its argument has ASCII
# 			repetoire.
#
# 		) For functions that return a string but do not have string arguments and use character_set_connection
# 			as the result character set, the result repetoire is ASCII if character_set_connection is ascii,
# 			and UNICODE otherwise:
#
# 				FORMAT(numeric_column, 4);
#
# 			Use of repetoire changes how MySQL evaluates the following example:
#
# 				SET NAMES ascii;
# 				CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT, b VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1);
# 				INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 'b');
# 				SELECT CONCAT(FORMAT(a, 4), b) FROM t1;
#
# 			Without repetoire, this error occurs:
#
# 				ERROR 1267 (HY000): Illegal mix of collations (ascii_general_ci, COERCIBLE)
# 				and (latin1_swedish_ci, IMPLICIT) for operation 'concat'
#
# 			Without repetoire, a result is returned:
#
# 				+--------------------------------+
# 				| CONCAT(FORMAT(a, 4), b) 			|
# 				+--------------------------------+
# 				| 1.0000b 								|
# 				+--------------------------------+
#
# 		) Functions with two or more string arguments use the "widest" argument repetoire for the result
# 			repetoire (UNICODE is wider than ASCII)
#
# 			Consider the following CONCAT() calls:
#
# 				CONCAT(_ucs2 X'0041', _ucs2 X'0042')
# 				CONCAT(_ucs2 X'0041', _ucs2 X'00C2')
#
# 			For the first call, the repetoire is ASCII because both arguments are within the range of the ascii character set.
# 			For the second call, the repetoire is UNICODE because the second argument is outside the ascii character set range.
#
# 		) The repetoire for function return values is determined based only on the repertoire of the arguments
# 			that affect the result's character set and collation.
#
# 				IF(column1 < column2, 'smaller', 'greater')
#
# 			The result repetoire is ASCII because the two string arguments (the second argument and the third argument)
# 			both have ASCII repetoire.
#
# 			The first argument does not matter for the result repetoire, even if the expression uses string values.
#
# UTF-8 FOR METADATA
#
# Metadata is "the data about the data". Anything that describes the DB, as opposed to being the contents of the db, is metadata.
#
# Thus column names, database names, user names, version names, and most of the string results from SHOW are metadata.
#
# This is also true of the contents of tables in INFORMATION_SCHEMA because those tables by definition contain
# information about database objects.
#
# Representation of metadata must satisfy these requirements:
#
# 		) All metadata must be in the same character set.
#
# 			Otherwise, neither the SHOW statements nor SELECT statements for tables in INFORMATION_SCHEMA would work
# 			properly because different rows in the same column of the results of these operations would be in different
# 			character sets.
#
# 		) Metadata must include all characters in all languages. Otherwise, users would not be able to name columns and tables
# 			using their own languages.
#
# To satisfy both requirements, MySQL stores metadata in a Unicode character set, namely UTF-8.
#
# This does not cause any disruption if you never use accented or non-Latin characters.
#
# But if you do, you should be aware that metqdata is in UTF-8.
#
# The metadata requirements mean that the return values of the USER(), CURRENT_USER(), SESSION_USER(),
# SYSTEM_USER(), DATABASE() and VERSION() functions have the UTF-8 character set by default.
#
# The server sets the character_set_system system variable to the name of the metadata character set:
#
# 		SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set_system';
# 		+-----------------------------+----------+
# 		| Variable_name 					| Value 	  |
# 		+-----------------------------+----------+
# 		| character_set_system 			| utf8 	  |
# 		+-----------------------------+----------+
#
# Storage of metadata using Unicode does NOT mean that the server returns headers of columns
# and the results of DESCRIBE functions in the character_set_system character set by default.
#
# When you use SELECT column1 FROM t, the name column1 itself is returned from the server to the
# client in the character set determined by the value of the character_set_results system variable,
# which has a default value of utf8mb4.
#
# If you want the server to pass metadata results back in a different character set, use the SET_NAMES
# statement to force the server to perform character set conversion.
#
# SET_NAMES sets the character_set_results and other related system variables.
#
# (See SECTION 10.4, "CONNECTION CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS")
#
# Alternatively, a client program can perform the conversion after receiving the result from the
# server.
#
# It is more efficient for the client to perform the conversion, but this option is not always available for all clients.
#
# If character_set_results is set to NULL, no conversion is performed and the server returns metadata
# using its original character set (the set indicated by character_set_system)
#
# Error messages returned from the server to the client are converted to the client character set automatically, as with metadata.
#
# If you are using (for example) the USER() function for comparison or assignment within a single statement,
# do not worry.
#
# MySQL performs some automatic conversion for you.
#
# 		SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE USER() = latin1_column;
#
# This works because the contents of latin1_column are automatically converted to
# UTF-8 before the comparison.
#
# 		INSERT INTO t1 (latin1_column) SELECT USER();
#
# This works because the contents of USER() are automatically converted to latin1 before the
# assignment.
#
# Although automatic conversion is not in the SQL standard, the standard does say that every character set
# is (in terms of supported characters) a "subset" of Unicode.
#
# Because it is a well-known principle that "what applies to a superset can apply to a subset", we believe
# that a collation for Unicode can apply for comparisons with non-Unicode strings.
#
# For more information about coercion of strings, see SECTION 10.8.4, "COLLATION COERCIBILITY IN EXPRESSIONS"
#
# SPECIFYING CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS
#
# There are default settings for character sets and collations at four levels:
#
# 		server, database, table and column.
#
# The description in the following sections may appear complex, but it has been found in practice
# that multiple-level defaulting leads to natural and obvious results.
#
# CHARACTER SET is used in clauses that specify a character set.
#
# CHARSET can be used as a synonym for CHARACTER SET.
#
# Character set issues affect not only data storage, but also communication between client
# programs and the MySQL server.
#
# If you want the client program to communicate with the server using a character set different
# from the default, you'll need to indicate which one.
#
# For example, to use the utf8mb4 Unicode character set, issue this statement after connecting
# to the server:
#
# 		SET NAMES 'utf8mb4';
#
# For more information about character set set-related issues in client/server communication,
# see SECTION 10.4, "CONNECTION CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS"
#
# COLLATION NAMING CONVENTIONS
#
# MySQL collation names follow these conventions:
#
# 		) A collation name starts with the name of the character set with which it is associated,
# 			generally followed by one or more suffixes indicating other collation characteristics.
#
# 			For example, utf8mb4_general_ci and latin1_swedish_ci are collations for the utf8mb4
# 			and latin1 character sets, respectively.
#
# 			The binary character set has a single collation, also named binary, with no suffixes.
#
# 		) A language-specific collation includes a locale code or language name.
#
# 			For example, utf8mb4_tr_0900_ai_ci and utf8mb4_hu_0900_ai_ci sort characters for the
# 			utf8mb4 character set using the rules of Turkish and Hungarian, respectively.
#
# 			utf8mb4_turkish_ci and utf8mb4_hungarian_ci are similar but based on a less recent
# 			version of the Unicode Collation Algorithm
#
# 		) Collation suffixes indicate whether a collation is case and accent sensitive, or binary.
#
# 			The following table shows the suffixes used to indicate these characteristics.
#
# 			TABLE 10.1 COLLATION CASE/ACCENT SENSITIVITY SUFFIXES
#
# 			Suffix 		Meaning
# 			_ai 			Accent insensitive
# 			_as 			Accent sensitive
# 			_ci 			Case insensitive
#
# 			_cs 			case-sensitive
# 			_ks 			Kana sensitive
# 			_bin 			Binary
#
# 			For nonbinary collation names that do not specify accent sensitivity, it is determined by case sensitivity.
#
# 			If a collation name does not contain _ai or _as, _ci in the name implies _ai and _cs in the name implies _as.
#
# 			For example, latin1_general_ci is explicitly case insensitive and implicitly accent insensitive,
# 			latin1_general_cs is explicitly case sensitive and implicitly accent sensitive, and utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
# 			is explicitly case and accent insensitive.
#
# 			For Japanese collations, the _ks suffix indicates that a collation is kana sensitive; that is,
# 			it distinguishes Katakana characters from Hiragana characters.
#
# 			Japanese collations without the _ks suffix are not kana sensitive and treat Katakana and Hiragana
# 			characters equal for sorting.
#
# 			For the binary collation of the binary character set, comparisons are based on numeric byte values.
#
# 			For the _bin collation of a nonbinary character set, comparisons are based on numeric character code
# 			values, which differ from byte values for multibyte characters.
#
# 			For more information, see SECTION 10.8.5, "THE BINARY COLLATION COMPARED TO _BIN COLLATIONS"
#
# 		) For Unicode character sets, collation names may include a version number to indicate the version of the
# 			Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) on which the collation is based.
#
# 			UCA-based collations without a version number in the name use the version-4.0.0 UCA weight keys.
#
# 			For example (These have external links related to them - just not written here):
#
# 				) utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci is based on UCA 9.0.0 weight keys 
#
# 				) utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci is based on UCA 5.2.0 weight keys
#
# 				) utf8mb4_unicode_ci (with no version named) is based on UCA 4.0.0 weight keys 
#
# 		) For Unicode character sets, the xxx_general_mysql500_ci collations preserve the pre-5.1.24 ordering
# 			of the original xxx_general_ci collations and permits upgrades for tables created before MySQL 5.1.24 (BUG #27877)
#
# 
# SERVER CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION
#
# MySQL Server has a server character set and a server collation.
#
# These can be set at server startup on the command line or in an option file and changed at runtime.
#
# Initially, the server character set and collation depend on the options that you use when you start mysqld.
#
# You can use --character-set-server for the character set. Along with it, you can add --collation-server for the collation.
#
# If you do not specify a character set, that is the same as saying --character-set-server=utf8mb4.
#
# If you specify only a character set (for example, utf8mb4) but not a collation, that is the same as saying
# --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci because utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci is the default
# collation for utf8mb4.
#
# Therefore, the following three commands all have the same effect:
#
# 		mysqld
# 		mysqld --character-set-server=utf8mb4
# 		mysqld --character-set-server=utf8mb4 \
# 			--collation-server=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
#
# One way to change the settings is by recompiling.
#
# To change the default server character set and collation when building from sources,
# use the DEFAULT_CHARSET and DEFAULT_COLLATION options for CMake.
#
# For example:
#
# 		cmake . -DDEFAULT_CHARSET=latin1
#
# or
#
# 		cmake . -DDEFAULT_CHARSET=latin1 \
# 			-DDEFAULT_COLLATION=latin1_german1_ci
#
# Both mysqld and CMake verify that the character set/collation combination is valid.
# If not, each program displays an error message and terminates.
#
# The server character set and collation are used as default values if the database character
# set and collation are not specified in CREATE_DATABASE statements.
#
# They have no other purpose.
#
# The current server character set and collation can be determined from the values of the
# character_set_server and collation_server system variables.
#
# These variables can be changed at runtime.
#
# DATABASE CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION
#
# Every database has a database character set and a database collation.
#
# The CREATE_DATABASE and ALTER_DATABASE statements have optional clauses for specifying the
# database character set and collation:
#
# 		CREATE DATABASE db_name
# 			[[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
#  		[[DEFAULT] COLLATE collation_name]
#
# 		ALTER DATABASE db_name
# 			[[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
# 			[[DEFAULT] COLLATE collation_name]
#
# The keyword SCHEMA can be used instead of DATABASE.
#
# The CHARACTER SET AND COLLATE clauses make it possible to create databases
# with different character sets and collations on the same MySQL server.
#
# Database options are stored in the data dictionary and can be examined by checking the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA table.
#
# Example:
#
# 		CREATE DATABASE db_name CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
#
# MySQL chooses the database character set and database collation in the following manner:
#
# 		) If both CHARACTER SET charset_name and COLLATE collation_name are specified, character set charset_name and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 		) If CHARACTER SET charset_name is specified without COLLATE, character set charset_name and its default collation are used.
#
# 			To see the default collation for each character set, use the SHOW_CHARACTER_SET statement or query
# 			the INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS table
#
# 		) If COLLATE collation_name is specified without CHARACTER SET, the character set associated with collation_name and collation
# 			collation_name are used.
#
# 		) Otherwise (neither CHARACTER SET nor COLLATE is specified), the server character set and server collation are used.
#
# The character set and collation for the default database can be determined from the values of the character_set_database
# and collation_database system variables.
#
# The server sets these variables whenever the default database changes.
#
# If there is no default database, the variables have the same value as the corresponding server-level
# system variables, character_set_server and collation_server.
#
# To see the default character set and collation for a given database, use these statements:
#
# 		USE db_name;
# 		SELECT @@character_set_database, @@collation_database;
#
# Alternatively, to display the values without changing the default database:
#
# 		SELECT DEFAULT_CHARACTER_SET_NAME, DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME
# 		FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'db_name';
#
# The database character set and collation affect these aspects of server operation:
#
# 		) For CREATE_TABLE statements, the database character set and collation are used as default values for table definitions
# 			if the table character set and collation are not specified.
#
# 			To override this, provide explicit CHARACTER SET and COLLATE table options.
#
# 		) For LOAD_DATA statements that include no CHARACTER SET clause, the server uses the character set indicated by the
# 			character_set_database system variable to interpret the information in the file.
#
# 			To override this, provide an explicit CHARACTER SET clause.
#
# 		) For stored routines (procedures and functions), the database character set and collation in effect at
# 			routine creation time are used as the character set and collation of character data parameters
# 			for which the declaration includes no CHARACTER SET or COLLATE attribute.
#
# 			To override this, provide explicit CHARACTER SET and COLLATE attributes.
#
# TABLE CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION
#
# Every table has a table character set and a table collation. The CREATE_TABLE and ALTER_TABLE statements have optional clauses
# for specifying the table character set and collation:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE tbl_name (column_list)
# 			[[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
# 			[COLLATE collation_name]]
#
# 		ALTER TABLE tbl_name
# 			[[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
# 			[COLLATE collation_name]
#
# Example:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 ( --- )
# 		CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
#
# MySQL chooses the table character set and collation in the following manner:
#
# 		) If both CHARACTER SET charset_name and COLLATE collation_name are specified, character set charset_name and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 		) If CHARACTER SET charset_name is specified without COLLATE, character set charset_name and its default collation are used.
#
# 			To see the default collation for each character set, use the SHOW_CHARACTER_SET statement or query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS table
#
# 		) If COLLATE collation_name is specified without CHARACTER SET, the character set associated with collation_name and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 		) Otherwise (neither CHARACTER SET nor COLLATE is specified), the database character set and collation are used.
#
# The table character set and collation are used as default values for column definitions if the column character
# set and collation are not specified in the individual column definitions.
#
# The table character set and collation are MySQL extensions; there are no such things in standard SQL.
#
# COLUMN CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION
#
# Every "character" column (that is, a column of type CHAR, VARCHAR or TEXT) has a column character set
# and a column collation.
#
# Column definition syntax for CREATE_TABLE and ALTER_TABLE has optional clauses for specifying the column
# character set and collation:
#
# 		col_name {CHAR | VARCHAR | TEXT} (col_length)
# 			[CHARACTER SET charset_name]
# 			[COLLATE collation_name]
#
# These clauses can also be used for ENUM and SET columns:
#
# 		col_name {ENUM | SET} (val_list)
# 			[CHARACTER SET charset_name]
# 			[COLLATE collation_name]
#
# Examples:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1
# 		(
# 			col1 VARCHAR(5)
# 				CHARACTER SET latin1
# 				COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
# 		);
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY
# 			col1 VARCHAR(5)
# 				CHARACTER SET latin1
# 				COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
#
# MySQL chooses the column character set and collation in the following manner:
#
# 		) If both CHARACTER SET charset_name and COLLATE collation_name are specified, character set
# 			charset_name and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 			CREATE TABLE t1
# 			(
# 				col1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci
# 			) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
#
# 			The character set and collation are specified for the column, so they are used.
#
# 			The column has character set UTF8 and collation utf8_unicode_ci
#
# 		) If CHARACTER SET charset_name is specified without COLLATE, character set charset_name
# 			and its default collation are used.
#
# 			CREATE TABLE t1
# 			(
# 				col1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
# 			) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
#
# 			The character set is specified for the column, but the collation is not.
#
# 			The column has character set utf8 and the default collation for utf8,
# 			which is utf8_general_ci
#
# 			To see the default collation for each character set, use the SHOW_CHARACTER_SET
# 			statement or query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS table.
#
# 		) If COLLATE collation_name is specified without CHARACTER SET, the character set associated
# 			with collation_name and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 			CREATE TABLE t1
# 			(
# 				col1 CHAR(10) COLLATE utf8_polish_ci
# 			) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
#
# 			The collation is specified for the column, but the character set is not.
#
# 			The column has collation utf8_polish_ci and the character set is the one associated
#			with the collation, which is utf8
#
# 		) Otherwise (neither CHARSET SET nor COLLATE is specified), the table character set and collation are used.
#
# 			CREATE TABLE t1
# 			(
# 				col1 CHAR(10)
# 			) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
#
# 			Neither the character set nor collation is specified for the column, so the table
# 			defaults are used.
#
# 			The column has character set latin1 and collation latin1_bin
#
# The CHARACTER SET and COLLATE clause are standard SQL.
#
# If you use ALTER_TABLE to convert a column from one character set to another,
# MySQL attempts to map the data values, but if the character set are incompatible - there may be data loss.
#
# CHARACTER STRING LITERAL CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION
#
# Every character string literal has a character set and a collation.
#
# For the simple SELECT 'string', the string has the connection default character set and collation defined
# by the character_set_connection and collation_connection system variables.
#
# A character string literal may have an optional character set introducer and COLLATE clause, to designate it
# as a string that uses a particular character set and collation:
#
# 		[_charset_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name]
#
# The _charset_name expression is formally called an introducer.
#
# It tells the parser, "the string that follows uses character set charset_name"
#
# An introducer does not change the string to the introducer character set like CONVERT() would do.
# It does not change the string value, although padding may occur.
#
# The introducer is just a signal. See SECTION 10.3.8, "CHARACTER SET INTRODUCERS"
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT 'abc';
# 		SELECT _latin1'abc';
# 		SELECT _binary'abc';
# 		SELECT utf8mb4'abc' COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;
#
# Character set introducers and the COLLATE clause are implemented according to standard
# SQL specifications.
#
# MySQL determines the character set and collation of a character string literal in the following manner:
#
# 		) If both _charset_name and COLLATE collation_name are specified, character set charset_name
# 			and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 			collation_name must be a permitted collation for charset_name
#
# 		) If _charset_name is specified but COLLATE is not specified, character set charset_name and its
# 			default collation are used.
#
# 			To see the default collation for each character set, use the SHOW_CHARACTER_SET statement or query
# 			the INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS table.
#
# 		) If _charset_name is not specified but COLLATE collation_name is specified, the connection default character
# 			set given by the character_set_connection system variable and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 			collation_name must be a permitted collation for the connection default character set.
#
# 		) Otherwise (neither _charset_name nor COLLATE collation_name is specified), the connection default
# 			character set and collation given by the character_set_connection and collation_connection system
# 			variables are used.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		) A nonbinary string with latin1 character set and latin1_german1_ci collation:
#
# 			SELECT _latin1'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
#
# 		) A nonbinary string with utf8mb4 character set and its default collation
# 			(that is, utf8mb4_general_ci):
#
# 			SELECT _utf8mb4'Müller';
#
# 		) A binary string with binary character set and its default collation (that is, binary):
#
# 			SELECT _binary'Müller';
#
# 		) A nonbinary string with the connection default character set and utf8mb4_general_ci collation
# 			(fails if the connection character set is not utf8mb4):
#
# 			SELECT 'Müller' COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
#
# 		) A string with the connection default character set and collation:
#
# 			SELECT 'Müller';
#
# An introducer indicates the character set for the following string, but does not change how the parser
# performs escape processing within the string.
#
# Escapes are always interpreted by the parser according to the character set given by character_set_connection
#
# The following examples show that escape processing occurs using character_set_connection even in the presence
# of an introducer.
#
# The examples use SET_NAMES (which changes character_set_connection, as discussed in Section 10.4, "CONNECTION CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS"),
# and display the resulting strings using the HEX() function so that the exact string contents can be seen.
#
# Example 1:
#
# 		SET NAMES latin1;
# 		SELECT HEX('à\n'), HEX(_sjis'à\n');
# 		+-----------------+-------------------+
# 		| HEX('à\n') 		| HEX(_sjis'à\n')   |
# 		+-----------------+-------------------+
# 		| E00A 				| E00A 				  |
# 		+-----------------+-------------------+
#
# Here, à (hexadecimal value E0) is followed by \n, the escape sequence for newline.
#
# The escape sequence is interpreted using the character_set_connection value of 
# latin1 to produce a literal newline (hexadecimal value 0A).
#
# This happens even for the second string. That is, the _sjis introducer does not affect
# the parser's escape processing.
#
# Example 2:
#
# 		SET NAMES sjis;
# 		SELECT HEX('à\n'), HEX(_latin1,'à\n');
# 		+----------------+-------------------+
# 		| HEX('à\n') 	  | HEX(_latin1'à\n') |
# 		+----------------+-------------------+
# 		| E05C6E 		  | E05C6E 				 |
# 		+----------------+-------------------+
#
# Here, character_set_connection is sjis, a character set in which the sequence of à followed by
# \ (hexadecimal values 05 and 5C) is a valid multibyte character.
#
# Hence, the first two bytes of the string are interpreted as a single sjis character, and the
# \ is not interpreted as an escape character.
#
# The following n (hexadecimal value 6E) is not interpreted as part of an escape sequence.
# This is true even for the second string; the _latin1 introducer does not affect escape processing.
#
# THE NATIONAL CHARACTER SET
#
# Standard SQL defines NCHAR or NATIONAL_CHAR as a way to indicate that a CHAR column should use some predefined
# character set.
#
# MySQL uses utf8 as this predefined character set.
#
# For example, these data type declarations are equivalent:
#
# 		CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
# 		NATIONAL CHARACTER(10)
# 		NCHAR(10)
#
# As are these:
#
# 		VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
# 		NATIONAL VARCHAR(10)
# 		NCHAR VARCHAR(10)
# 		NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING(10)
# 		NATIONAL CHAR VARYING(10)
#
# You can use N'literal' (or n'literal') to create a string in the national character set.
# These statements are equivalent:
#
# 		SELECT N'some text';
# 		SELECT n'some text';
# 		SELECT _utf8'some text';
#
# CHARACTER SET INTRODUCERS
#
# A character string literal, hexadecimal literal or bit-value literal may have an optional character
# set introducer and COLLATE clause, to designate it as a string that uses a particular character set and
# collation:
#
# 		[_charset_name] literal [COLLATE collation_name]
#
# The _charset_name expression is formally called an introducer.
#
# IT tells the parser, "The string that follows uses character set charset_name"
#
# An introducer does not change the string to the introducer character set like CONVERT()
# would do.
#
# It does not change the string value, although padding may occur.
#
# The introducer is just a signal.
#
# For character string literals, space between the introducer and the string is permitted but optional.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		SELECT 'abc';
# 		SELECT _latin1'abc';
# 		SELECT _binary'abc';
#
# 		SELECT _utf8mb4'abc' COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;
#
# 		SELECT _latin1 X'4D7953514C';
# 		SELECT _utf8mb4 0x4D7953514C COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;
#
# 		SELECT _latin1 b'1000001';
# 		SELECT _utf8mb4 0b1000001 COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;
#
# Character set introducers and the COLLATE clause are implemented according to standard SQL specifications.
#
# Character string literals can be designated as binary strings by using the _binary introducer.
#
# Hexadecimal literals and bit-value literals are binary strings by default, so _binary is permitted,
# but normally unnecessary.
#
# _binary may be useful to preserve a hexadecimal or bit literal as a binary string in contexts
# for which the literal is otherwise treated as a number.
#
# For example, bit operations permit numeric or binary string arguments in MySQL 8.0 and higher,
# but treat hexadecimal and bit literals as numbers by default.
#
# To explicitly specify binary string context for such literals, use a _binary introducer
# for at least one of the arguments:
#
# 		SET @v1 = X'000D' | X'0BC0';
# 		SET @v2 = _binary X'000D' | X'0BC0';
# 		SELECT HEX(@v1), HEX(@v2);
# 		+---------------+-----------------+
# 		| HEX(@v1) 		 | HEX(@v2) 		 |
# 		+---------------+-----------------+
# 		| BCD 			 | 0BCD 				 |
# 		+---------------+-----------------+
#
# The displayed result appears similar for both bit operations, but the result without _binary is a BIGINT value,
# whereas the result with _binary is a binary string.
#
# Due to the difference in result types, the displayed values differ:
#
# 		High-order 0 digits are not displayed for the numeric result
#
# MySQL determines the character set and collation of a character string literal, hexadecimal literal or
# bit-value literal in the following manner:
#
# 		) If both _charset_name and COLLATE collation_name are specified, character set charset_name and collation
# 			collation_name are used.
#
# 			collation_name must be a permitted collation for charset_name
#
# 		) If _charset_name is specified but COLLATE is not specified, character set charset_name and its default
# 			collation are used.
#
# 			To see the default collation for each character set, use the SHOW_CHARACTER_SET statement or query the
# 			INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS table.
#
# 		) If _charset_name it not specified but COLLATE collation_name is specified:
#
# 			) For a character string literal, the connection default character set given by the character_set_connection
# 				system variable and collation collation_name are used.
#
# 				collation_name must be permitted collation for the connection default character set.
#
# 			) For a hexadecimal literal or bit-value literal, the only permitted collation is binary because
# 				these types of literals are binary strings by default.
#
# 		) Otherwise (neither _charset_name nor COLLATE collation_name is specified):
#
# 			) For a character string literal, the connection default character set and collation given by the 
# 				character_set_connection and collation_connection system variables are used.
#
# 			) For a hexadecimal literal or bit-value literal, the character set and collation are binary.
#
# Examples:
#
# 		) Nonbinary strings with latin1 character set and latin1_german1_ci collation:
#
# 			SELECT _latin1'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
# 			SELECT _latin1 X'0A0D' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
# 			SELECT _latin1 b'0110' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
#
# 		) Nonbinary strings with utf8mb4 character set and its default collation (that is, utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci):
#
# 			SELECT _utf8mb4'Müller';
# 			SELECT _utf8mb4 X'0A0D';
# 			SELECT _utf8mb4 b'0110';
#
# 		) Binary strings with binary character set and its default collation (that is, binary):
#
# 			SELECT _binary'Müller';
# 			SELECT X'0A0D';
# 			SELECT b'0110';
#
# 			The hexadecimal literal and bit-value literal need no introducer because they are binary strings by default
#
# 		) A nonbinary string with the connection default character set and utf8mb4_general_ci collation
# 			(fails if the connection character set is not utf8mb4):
#
# 			SELECT 'Múller' COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
#
# 			This construction (COLLATE ONLY) does not work for hexadecimal literals or bit literals because their
# 			character set is binary no matter the connection character set and binary is not compatible with
# 			the utf8mb4_general_ci collation.
#
# 			The only permitted COLLATE clause in the absence of an introducer is COLLATE binary
#
# 		) A string with the connection default character set and collation:
#
# 			SELECT 'Müller';
#
# For character set literals, an introducer indicates the character set for the following string,
# but does not change how the parser performs escape processing within the string.
#
# Escapes are always interpreted by the parser according to the character set given by
# character_set_connection
#
# For additional discussion and examples, see SECTION 10.3.6 "CHARACTER STRING LITERAL CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION"
#
# EXAMPLES OF CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION ASSIGNMENT
#
# The following examples show how MySQL determines default character set and collation values.
#
# EXAMPLE 1: TABLE AND COLUMN DEFINITION
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1
# 		(
# 			c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
# 		) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_bin;
#
# Here we have a column with a latin1 character set and a latin1_german_ci collation.
#
# the definition is explicit, so that is straightforward. Notice that htere is no problem
# with storing a latin1 column in a latin2 table.
#
# EXAMPLE 2: TABLE AND COLUMN DEFINITION
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1
# 		(
# 			c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1
# 		) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
#
# 		THis time, we have a column with a latin1 character set and a default collation.
#
# 		Although it might seem natural, the default collation is not taken from the table level.
#
# 		INstead, because the default collation for latin1 is always latin1_swedish_ci, column c1 has a collation
# 		of latin1_swedish_ci (not latin1_danish_ci)
#
# EXAMPLE 3: TABLE AND COLUMN DEFINITION
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1
# 		(
# 			c1 CHAR(10)
# 		) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
#
# 		We have a column with a default character set and a default collation.
#
# 		In this circumstance, MySQL checks the table level to determine the column char set
# 		and collation.
#
# 		Consequently, the character set for column c1 is latin1 and its collation is latin1_danish_ci
#
# EXAMPLE 4: DATABASE, TABLE and COLUMN DEFINITION
#
# CREATE DATABASE d1
# 		DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_czech_ci;
# USE d1;
# CREATE TABLE t1
# (
# 		c1 CHAR(10)
# );
#
# We create a column without specifying its character set and collation.
#
# We're also not specifying a character set and a collation at the table level.
#
# In this circumstance, MySQL checks the database level to determine the table settings,
# which thereafter become the column settings.
#
# Consequently, the character set for column c1 is latin2 and its collation is latin2_czech_ci
#
# COMPATBILITY WITH OTHER DBMSs
#
# For MaxDB compatbility these two statements are the same:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (f1 CHAR(N) UNICODE);
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (f1 CHAR(N) CHARACTER SET ucs2);
#
# CONNECTION CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS
#
# A "connection" is what a client program makes when it connects to the server, to begin a session
# within which it interacts with the server.
#
# The client sends SQL statements, such as queries, over the session connection.
#
# The server sends responses, such as result sets or error messages, over the connection
# back to the client.
#
# CONNECTION CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION SYSTEM VARIABLES
#
# Several character set and collation system variables relate to a client's interaction
# with the server.
#
# Some of these have been mentioned in earlier sections:
#
# 		) The character_set_server and collation_server system variables indicate the server
# 			character set and collation.
#
# 			See SECTION 10.3.2, "SERVER CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION"
#
# 		) The character_set_database and collation_database system variables indicate the character
# 			set and collation of the default database.
#
# 			See SECTION 10.3.3, "DATABASE CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION"
#
# Additional character set and collation system variables are involved in handling traffic for the
# connection between a client and the server.
#
# Every client has a session-specific connection-related character set and collation system variables.
#
# These session system variable values are initialized at connect time, but can be changed within the
# session.
#
# Several questions about character set and collation handling for client connections can be answered
# in terms of system variables:
#
# 		) What character set are statements in when they leave the client?
#
# 			The server takes the character_set_client system variable to be the
# 			character set in which statements are sent by the client.
#
# 				NOTE:
#
# 					Some characters sets cannot be used as the client character set. See IMPERMISSIBLE CLIENT CHARACTER SETS.
#
# 		) What character set should the server translate statements to after receiving them?
#
# 			To determine this, the server uses the character_set_connection and collation_connection system variables.
#
# 				) The server converts statements sent by the client from character_set_client to character_set_connection
#
# 				 	Exception: For string literals that have an introducer such as utf8mb4 or _latin2, the introducer
# 					determines the character set. See SECTION 10.3.8, "CHARACTER SET INTRODUCERS"
#
# 				) collation_connection is important for comparisons of literal strings.
#
# 					For comparisons of strings with column values, collation_connection does not matter
# 					because columns have their own collation, which has a higher collation precedence.
#
# 					(See SECTION 10.8.4, "COLLATION COERCIBILITY IN EXPRESSIONS")
#
# 		) What character set should the server translate query results to before shipping them back to the client?
#
# 			The character_set_results system variable indicates the character set in which the server
# 			returns query results to the client.
#
# 			This includes result data such as column values, result metadata such as column names and errors messages.
#
# 			To tell the server to perform no conversion of result sets or error messages, set character_set_results
# 			to NULL or binary.
#
# 				SET character_set_results = NULL;
# 				SET character_set_results = binary;
#
# 			For more information about character sets and error messages, see SECTION 10.6, "ERROR MESSAGE CHARACTER SET"
#
# To see the values of the character set and collation system variables that apply to the current session,
# use this statement:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_variables
# 		WHERE VARIABLE_NAME IN (
# 			'character_set_client', 'character_set_connection',
# 			'character_set_results', 'collation_connection'
# 		) ORDER BY VARIABLE_NAME;
#
# The following simpler statements also display the connection variables, but include other related variables
# as well.
#
# They can be useful to see ALL character set and collation system variables:
#
# 		SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character\_set\_%';
# 		SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'collation\_%';
#
# Clients can fine-tune the settings for these variables, or depend on the defaults (in which case,
# you can skip the rest of this section)
#
# If you do not use defaults, you must change the character settings for each connection to the server.
#
# IMPERMISSIBLE CLIENT CHARACTER SETS
#
# The character_set_client system variable cannot be set to certain character sets:
#
# 		ucs2
# 		utf16
# 		utf16le
# 		utf32
#
# Attempting to use any of those character sets as the client character set produces an error:
#
# 		SET character_set_client = 'ucs2';
# 		ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'character_set_client'
# 		can't be set to the value of 'ucs2'
#
# The same error occurs if any of those character sets are used in the following contexts,
# all of which result in an attempt to set character_set_client to the named character set:
#
# 		) The --default-character-set=charset_name command option used by MySQL client programs 
# 			such as mysql and mysqladmin
#
# 		) The SET_NAMES_'charset_name' statement
#
# 		) The SET_CHARACTER_SET_'charset_name' statement
#
# CLIENT PROGRAM CONNECTION CHARACTER SET  CONFIGURATION
#
# When a client connects to the server, it indicates which character set it wants to use for
# communication with the server.
#
# (Actually, the client indicates the default collation for that character set, from which
# 	the server can determine the character set)
#
# The server uses this information to set the character_set_client, character_set_results,
# character_set_connection system variables to the character set, and collation_connection to
# the character set default collation.
#
# In effect, the server performs the equivalent of a SET_NAMES operation.
#
# If the server does not support the requested character set or collation, it falls back
# to using the server character set and collation to configure the connection.
#
# For additional detail, about this fallback behavior, see CONNECTION CHARACTER SET ERROR HANDLING
#
# THe mysql, mysqladmin, mysqlcheck, mysqlimport and mysqlshow client programs determine the default
# character set to use as follows:
#
# 		) In the absence of other information, each client uses the compiled-in default character set, usually utf8mb4
#
# 		) Each client can autodetect which character set to use based on the operating system setting, such as 
# 			the value of the LANG or LC_ALL locale environment variable on Unix systems or the code page
# 			setting on Windows systems.
#
# 			For systems on which the locale is available from the OS, the client uses it to set the default
#  		character set rather than using the compiled-in default.
#
# 			For example, setting LANG to ru_RU.KOI8-R causes the koi8r character set to be used.
#
# 			Thus, users can configure the locale in their environment for use by MySQL clients.
#
# 			The OS character set is mapped to the closest MySQL character set if there is no exact match.
#
# 			IF the client does not support the matching character set, it uses the compiled-in default.
#
# 			FOr example, utf8 and utf-8 map to utf8mb4, and ucs2 is not supported as a connection
# 			character set, so it maps to the compiled-in default.
#
# 			C applications can use character set autodetection based on the OS setting by invoking mysql_options()
# 			as follows before connecting to the server:
#
# 				mysql_options(mysql,
# 								  MYSQL_SET_CHARSET_NAME,
# 								  MYSQL_AUTODETECT_CHARSET_NAME);
#
# 		) Each client supports a --default-character-set option, which enables users to specify the character set
# 			explicitly to override whatever default the client otherwise determines.
#
# 				NOTE:
#
# 					Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set.
#
# 					Attempting to use them with --default-character-set produces an error.
#
# 					See IMPERMISSIBLE CLIENT CHARACTER SETS
#
# With the mysql client, to use a character set different from the default, you could explicitly execute
# a SET_NAMES statement every time you connect to the server (see CLIENT PROGRAM CONNECTION CHARACTER SET CONFIGURATION)
#
# To accomplish the same result more easily, specify the character set in your option files.
#
# For example, the following option file setting changes the three connection-related character
# set system variables set to koi8r each time you invoke mysql:
#
# 		[mysql]
# 		default-character-set=koi8r
#
# If oyu are using the mysql client with auto-reconnect enabled (which is not recommended), it is
# preferable to use the charset command rather than SET_NAMES.
#
# For example:
#
# 		charset koi8r
# 		Charset changed
#
# The charset command issues a SET_NAMES statement, and also changes the default character set that
# mysql uses when it reconnects after the connection has dropped.
#
# When configuring client programs, you must also consider the environment within which they execute.
#
# See SECTION 10.5 "CONFIGURING APPLICATION CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION"
#
# SQL STATEMENTS FOR CONNECTION CHARACTER SET CONFIGURATION
#
# After a connection has been established, clients can change the character set and collation system variables
# for the current session.
#
# These variables can be changed individually using SET statements, but two more convenient statements affect hte
# connection-related character set system variables as a group:
#
# 		) SET NAMES 'charset_name' [COLLATE 'collation_name']
#
# 			SET_NAMES indicates what character set the client will use to send SQL statements to the server.
#
# 			Thus, SET_NAMES_'cp1251' tells the server, "future incoming messages from this client are in the charset cp1251"
#
# 			It also specifies the character set that the server should use for sending results back to the client.
#
# 			(For example, it indicates what character set to use for column values if you use a SELECT statement that produces
# 				a result set)
#
# 			A SET_NAMES_'charset_name' statement is equivalent to these three statements:
#
# 				SET character_set_client = charset_name;
# 				SET character_set_results = charset_name;
# 				SET character_set_connection = charset_name;
#
# 			Setting character_set_connection to charset_name also implicitly sets collation_connection to the default
# 			collation for charset_name.
#
# 			It is unnecessary to set that collation explicitly.
#
# 			To specify a particular collation to use for collation_connection, add a COLLATE clause:
#
# 				SET NAMES 'charset_name' COLLATE 'collation_name'
#
# 		) SET CHARACTER SET 'charset_name'
#
# 			SET_CHARACTER_SET is similar to SET_NAMES but sets character_set_connection and collation_connection
# 			to character_set_database and collation_database
#
# 			(which, as mentioned previously, indicate the character set and collation of the default DB)
#
# 			A SET_CHARACTER_SET_charset_name statement is equivalent to these three statements:
#
# 				SET character_set_client = charset_name;
# 				SET character_set_results = charset_name;
# 				SET collation_connection = @@collation_database;
#
# 			Setting collation_connection also implicitly sets character_set_connection to the character
# 			set associated with the collation (equivalent to executing SET character_set_connection = @@character_set_database)
#
# 			It is unnecessary to set character_set_connection explicitly.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set.
#
# 				Attempting to use them with SET_NAMES or SET_CHARACTER_SET produces an error.
#
# 				See IMPERMISSIBLE CLIENT CHARACTER SETS
#
# Example: Suppose that column1 is defined as CHAR(5) CHARACTER SET latin2.
#
# If you do not say SET_NAMES or SET_CHARACTER_SET, then for SELECT column1 FROM t,
# the server sends back all the values for column1 using the charset that was specified when connecting.
#
# On the other hand, if you say SET NAMES 'latin1' or SET CHARACTER SET 'latin1' before issuing the SELECT
# statement, the server converts the latin2 values to latin1 just before sending results back.
#
# Conversion may be lossy for characters that are not in both character sets.
#
# CONNECTION CHARACTER SET ERROR HANDLING
#
# Attempts to use an inappropriate connection character set or collation can produce an error,
# or cause the server to fall back to its default character set and collation for a given connection.
#
# This section describes problems that can occur when configuring the connection character set.
#
# THese problems can occur when establishing a connection or when changing the char set within an established connection.
#
# CONNECT-TIME ERROR HANDLING
#
# Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set, see IMPERMISSIBLE CLIENT CHARACTER SETS.
#
# If you specify a character set that is valid but not permitted as a client character set,
# the server returns an error:
#
# 		mysql --default-character-set=ucs2
# 		ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'character_set_client' can't be set to the value of 'ucs2'
#
# If you specify a character set that the client does not recognize, it produces an error:

#
# If you specify a character set that the client recognizes but the server does not,
# the server falls back to its default character set and collation.
#
# Suppose that the server is configured to use latin1 and latin1_swedish_ci as its defaults,
# and that it does not recognize gb18030 as a valid character set.
#
# A client that specifies --default-character-set=gb18030 is able to connect to the server,
# but hte resulting character set is not what hte client wants:

# 		+------------------------+-------------------+
#
# YOu can see that the connection system variables have been set to reflect a character
# set and collation of latin1 and latin1_swedish_ci
#
# This occurs because the server cannot satisfy the client char set request and falls back
# to its defaults.
#
# In this case, the client cannot use the character set that it wants because the
# server does not support it.
#
# The client must either be willing to use a different character set, or connect to a 
# different server that supports the desired character set
#
# The same problem occurs in a more subtle context: When the client tells the server to use
# a character set that hte server recognize, but the default collation for that
# char set on the client side is not known on the server side.
#
# THis occurs, ofr example, when a MySQL 8.0 client wnats to connect to a MySQL 5.7 server
# using utf8mb4 as the client character set.
#
# A client that specifies --default-character-set=utf8mb4 is able to connect to the server.
#
# However, as in the previous example, the server falls back to its default character set
# and collation, not what the client requested:
#
# 		SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character\_set\_%';
# 		+----------------------------------+--------------+
# 		| Variable_name 						  | Value 		  |

# 		+-------------------------+-----------------------+
# 		| collation_connection 	  | latin1_swedish_ci 	  |
# 		+-------------------------+-----------------------+
#
# Why?
#
# After all, utf8mb4 is known to 8.0 client and 5.7 server, so both of them recognize it.
#
# To understand this behavior, it is necessary to understand that when the client tells
# the server which char set it wants to use, it really tells the server the default collation
# for that character set.
#
# Therefore, the aformentioned behavior occurs due to a combination of factors:
#
# 		) The default collation for utf8mb4 differs between MySQL 5.7 and 8.0 (utf8mb4_general_ci for 5.7, utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci for 8.0)
#
# 		) When the 8.0 client requests a char set of utf8mb4, what it sends to the server is the default 8.0 utf8mb4 collation; that is,
# 			the utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
#
# 		) utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci is implemented only as of MysQL 8.0, so the 5.7 server does not recognize it
#
# 		) Because the 5.7 server does not recognize utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci, it cannot satisfy the client char set request,
# 			and falls back to its default char set and collation (latin1 and latin1_swedish_ci)
#
# In this case, the client can still use utf8mb4 by issuing a SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' statement after connecting.
#
# The resulting collation is the 5.7 default utf8mb4 collation; that is, utf8mb4_general_ci 
#
# If the client additionally wants a collation of utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci, it cannot achieve that because
# the server does not recognize that collation.
#
# The client must either be willing to use a different utf8mb4 collation, or connect to a server from
# MySQL 8.0 or higher.
#
# RUNTIME ERROR HANDLING
#
# Within an estblished connection, the client can request a change of connection character set and collation
# with SET_NAMES or SET_CHARACTER_SET
#
# Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set; see IMPERMISSIBLE CLIENT CHARACTER SETS.
#
# If you specify a character set that is valid, but not permitted as a client character set , the server returns an error:
#
# 		SET NAMES 'ucs2';
# 		ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'character_set_client' can't be set to
# 		the value of 'ucs2'
#
# If the server doesn ot recognize the character set (or the collation), it produces an error:
#
# 		SET NAMES 'bogus';
# 		ERROR 1115 (42000): Unknown character set 'bogus'
#
# 		SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'bogus';
# 		ERROR 1273 (HY000): Unknown collation: 'bogus'
#
# TIP:
#
# 		A client that wants to verify whether its requested character set was honored by the server can execute
# 		the following statement after connecting and checking that hte result is the expected character set:
#
# 			SELECT @@character_set_client;
#
# CONFIGURING APPLICATION CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION
#
# For applications that store data using the default MysQL character set and collation (utf8mb4, utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci),
# no special configuration should be needed.
#
# If applications require data storage using a different character set or collation, you can configure character set
# information in several ways:
#
# 		) Specify character settings per DB. For example, applications that use one database might use the default
# 			of utf8mb4, whereas applications that use another database might use sjis
#
# 		) Specify character settings at server startup. This causes the server to use the given settings for all applications
# 			that do not make other arrangements.
#
# 		) Specify character settings at configuration time, if you build MySQL from source.
#
# 			This causes the server to use the given settings as the defaults for all applications,
# 			without having to specify them at server startup.
#
# When different applications require different character settings, the per-database techniques provides
# a good deal of flexibility.
#
# If most or all applications use the same character set, specifying character settings at server startup 
# or configuration time may be the most convenient.
#
# For the per-database or server-startup techniques, the settings control the character set for data storage.
#
# Applications must also tell the server which character set to use for client/server communications,
# as described in the following instructions.
#
# The examples shown here assume use of the latin1 character set and latin1_swedish_ci collation
# in particular contexts as an alternative to the defaults of utf8mb4 and utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
#
# 		) Specify character settings per database.
#
# 			To create a database such that its tables will use a given default character set and collation
# 			for data storage, use a CREATE_DATABASE statement as follows:
#
# 				CREATE DATABASE mydb
# 					CHARACTER SET latin1
# 					COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
#
# 			Tables created in the database will use latin1 and latin1_swedish_ci by default for any characer columns.
#
# 			APplications that use the datbase should also configure their connection to the server each time they connect.
# 			THis can be done by executing a SET NAMES 'latin1' statement after connecting.
#
# 			THis statement can be used regardless of connection method (the mysql client, PHP scripts, and so forth)
#
# 			In some cases, it may be possible to configure the connection to use the desired char set some other way.
#
# 			For example, to connect using mysql, you can specify the --default-character-set=latin1 command-line option
# 			to achieve the same effect as SET NAMES 'latin1'
#
# 			For more information about configuring client connections, see SECTION 10.4 "CONNECTION CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS"
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				If you use ALTER_DATABASE to change the database default character set or collation,
# 				existing stored routines in the database that use those defaults must be dropped
# 				and recreated so that htey use the new defaults.
#
# 				(In a stored routine, variables with character data types use the database defaults
# 				if the character set or collation are not specified explicitly.
#
# 				see SECTION 13.1.17, "CREATE PROCEDURE AND CREATION FUNCTION SYNTAX"
#
# 		) Specifying character settings at server startup.
#
# 			To select a character set and collation at server startup, use the --character-set-server
# 			and --collation-server options.
#
# 			For example, to specify the option in an option file, include these lines:
#
# 				[mysqld]
# 				character-set-server=latin1
# 				collation-server=latin1_swedish_ci
#
# 			These settings apply server-wide and apply as the defaults for databases created by any application,
# 			and for tables created in those datbases.
#
# 			It is still necessary for applications to configure their connection using SET_NAMES or equivalent
# 			after they connect, as described previously.
#
# 			YOu might be tempted to start the server with the --init_connect="SET_NAMES_'latin1'" option to
# 			cause SET_NAMES to be executed automatically for each client that connects.
#
# 			However, this may yield inconsistencies because the init_connect value is not executed for users who
# 			have the CONNECTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege.
#
# 		) Specify character settings at MySQL configuration time.
#
# 			To select a character set and collation if you configure and build MySQL from source,
# 			use the DEFAULT_CHARSET and DEFAULT_COLLATION CMake options:
#
# 				cmake . -DDEFAULT_CHARSET=latin1 \
# 					-DDEFAULT_COLLATION=latin1_swedish_ci
#
# 			THe resulting server uses latin1 and latin1_swedish_ci as the default for databases and tables and for
# 			client connections.
#
# 			It is unnecessary to use --character-set-server and --collation-server to specify those defaults at server
# 			startup.
#
# 			It is also unecessary for applications to configure their connection using SET_NAMES or equivalent
# 			after they connect to the server.
#
# Regarldess of how you configure the MYSQL character set for application use, you must also consider the
# environment within which those applications execute.
#
# FOr example, if oyu will send statements using UTF-8 text taken from a file that  you create in an editor,
# you shoul dedit the file with the locale of your environment set to UTF-8 so that hte file 
# encoding is correct and so that the operating system handles it correctly.
#
# If you use the mysql client from within a terminal window, the window must be configured to use UTF-8 or characters
# may not display proeprly.
#
# For a script htat executes ina  web environment, the4 script must handle char encodings properly ofr its
# interaction with the MySQl server, and it msut generate pages the correctly indicate the encoding so that
# browsers know how to display the content of the pages.
#
# For example, you can include this <meta> tag within your <head> element:
#
# 		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>
#
# ERROR MESSAGE CHARACTER SET
#
# THis section describes how the MySQL server uses char sets for constructing error messages.
#
# FOr information about the language of error messages (rather than the char set), see
# SECTION 10.11 "SETTING THE ERROR MESSAGE LANGUAGE"
#
# FOr general information about configuring error logging, see SECTION 5.4.2 "THE ERROR LOG"
#
# CHARACTER SET FOR ERROR MESSAGE CONSTRUCTION
#
# The server constructs error messages as follows:
#
# 		) The message template uses UTF-8 (utf8mb3)
#
# 		) Parameters in the message template are replaced with values that apply to a specific error occurence:
#
# 			) Identifiers such as table or column names use UTF-8 internally so they are copied as is
#
# 			) Character (nonbinary) string values are converted from their character set to UTF-8
#
# 			) Binary string values are copied as is for bytes in the range 0x20 to 0x7E and using \x
# 				hexadecimal encoding for bytes outside that range.
#
# 				For example, if a duplicate-key error occurs for an attempt to insert 0x41CF9F into a VARBINARY
# 				unique column, the resulting error message uses UTF-8 with some bytes hexadecimal encoded:
#
# 					Duplicate entry 'A\xC3\x9F' for key 1
#
# CHARACTER SET FOR ERROR MESSAGE DISPOSITION
#
# An error message, once ocnstructed, can be written by the server to the error log or sent to clients:
#
# 		) IF the server writes the error message to the error log, it writes it in UTF-8 as constructed, without conversion
# 			to another character set.
#
# 		) If the server sends the error message to a client program, the server converts it from UTF-8 to the character
# 			set specified by the character_set_results system variable.
#
# 			If character_set_results have a value of NULL or binary, no conversion occurs.
#
# 			No conversion occurs if the variable value is utf8mb3 ot utf8mb4, either, because
# 			those character sets have a repetoire that includes all UTF-8 characters used in message
# 			construction.
#
# 			If characters cannot be represented in character_set_results, some encoding may occur during the conversion.
#
# 			The encoding uses Unicode code point values:
#
# 				) Characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) range (0x0000 to 0xFFFF) are written using \nnnn notation
#
# 				) Characters outside the BMP range (0x10000 to 0x10FFFF) are written using \+nnnnnn notation
#
# 			Clients can set character_set_results to control the character set in which they receive error messages.
#
# 			THe variable can be set directly, or indireclty, by means such as SET_NAMES.
#
# 			For more information about character_set_results, see SECTION 10.4, "CONNECTION CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS"
#
#
# COLUMN CHARACTER SET CONVERSION
#
# To convert a binary or nonbinary string column to use a particular character set, use ALTER_tABLE.
#
# For successful conversion to occur, one of the following conditions must apply:
#
# 		) If the column has a binary data type (BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB) - all the values that it contains must be encoded
# 			using a single character set (the character set you are converting the column to)
#
# 			If you use a binary column to store information in multiple character sets, MySQL has no way to know which
# 			values use which character set and cannot convert teh data propeprly.
#
# 		) If the column has a nonbinary data type (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT), its contents should be encoded
# 			in the column character set, not some other character set.
#
# 			If the contents are encoded in a different character set, you can convert the column to use
# 			a binary data type first, and then to nonbinary column with the desired char set.
#
# Suppose that a table t has a binary column named col1 defined as VARBINARY(50)
#
# Assuming that the information in the column is encoded using a single character set,
# you can convert it to a nonbinary column that has that character set.
#
# For example, if col1 contains binary data representing chars in the greek char set, you can
# convert it as follows:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t MODIFY col1 VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET greek;
#
# If your original column type has a type of BINARY(50), you could convert it to CHAR(50),
# but the resulting values will be padded with 0x00 bytes at the end, which may be
# undesirable.
#
# TO remove these bytes, use the TRIM() function:
#
# 		UPDATE t SET col1 = TRIM(TRAILING 0x00 FROM col1);
#
# SUppose that table t has a nonbinary column named col1 defined as CHAR(50) CHARACTER SET latin1 but
# you want to convert it to use utf8 so that you can store values from many languages.
#
# The following statement accomplishes this:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t MODIFY col1 CHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8;
#
# Conversion may be lossy if the column contains chars that are not in both char sets.
#
# A special case occurs if you have old tables from < 4.1,, where a nonbinary column contains values
# that actually are encoded in a char set different from the server's default char set.
#
# FOr example, an application might have stored sjis value in a column, even though MySQL's default
# character set was different.
#
# iT is possible to convert the column to use the proper character set but an additional step is required.
#
# Suppose that hte server's default character set was latin1 and col1 is defined as CHAR(50), but its content
# are sjis values.
#
# The first step is to convert the column to a binary data type, which removes existting char set information
# without performing any char conversion:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t MODIFY col1 BLOB;
#
# The next step is to convert the column to a nonbinary data type with the proper character set:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY col1 CHAR(50) CHARACTER SET sjis;
#
# This procedure might require that the table not have been modified already with statements such as INSERT
# or UPDATE after an upgrade to 4.1 or later.
#
# In that case, MySQL would store new vlaues in the column using latin1, and the column will contain a mix of
# sjis and latin1 values and cannot be converted properly.
#
# IF you specified attributes when creating a column intiially, you should also specify them when altering
# the table with ALTER_TABLE 
#
# For example, if you specified NOT NULL and an explicit DEFAULT value, you should also provide them
# in the ALTER_TABLE statement.
#
# Otherwise, the resulting column definiton will not include those attributes.
#
# To convert all characer columns in a table, the ALTER TABLE --- CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET charset statement
# may be useful.
#
# See SECTION 13.1.9, "ALTER TABLE SYNTAX"
#
# COLLATION ISSUES
#
# The following section discusses various aspects of char set collations
#
# USING COLLATE IN SQL STATEMENTS
#
# With the COLLATE clause, you can override whathever the default collation is for a comparison.
# COLLATE may be used in various parts of SQL statements.
#
# Here are some examples:
#
# 		) With ORDER BY:
#
# 				SELECT k
# 				FROM t1
# 				ORDER BY k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
#
# 		) With AS:
#
# 				SELECT k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci AS k1
# 				FROM t1
# 				ORDER BY k1;
#
# 		) With GROUP BY:
#
# 				SELECT k
# 				FROM t1
# 				GROUP BY k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
#
# 		) With aggregate functions:
#
# 				SELECT MAX(k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci)
# 				FROM t1;
#
# 		) With DISTINCT:
#
# 				SELECT DISTINCT k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci
# 				FROM t1;
#
# 		) With WHERE:
#
# 				SELECT
# 				FROM t1
# 				WHERE _latin1 'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci = k;
#
# 				SELECT
# 				FROM t1
# 				WHERE k LIKE _latin1 'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
#
# 		) With HAVING:
#
# 				SELECT k
# 				FROM t1
# 				GROUP BY k
# 				HAVING k = _latin1 'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
#
# COLLATE CLAUSE PRECEDENCE
#
# The COLLATE clause has high precedence (higehr than binary OR ||), so the following
# two expresisons are equivalent:
#
# 		x || y COLLATE z
# 		x || (y COLLATE z)
#
# CHARACTER SET AND COLLATION COMPATIBILITY
#
# Each character set has one or more collations,, but each collation is associated
# with one and only one character set.
#
# Therefore, the following statement causes an error message
# because the latin2_bin collation is not legal with the latin1 char set:
#
# 		SELECT _latin1 'x' COLLATE latin2_bin;
# 		ERROR 1253 (42000): COLLATION 'latin2_bin' is not valid
# 		for CHARACTER SET 'latin1'
#
# COLLATION COERCIBILITY IN EXPRESSIONS
#
# In the great majority of statements, it is obvious what collation MySQL uses to resolve
# a comparison operation.
#
# FOr example, in the following cases, it should be clear that the collation is the
# collation of column x:
#
# 		SELECT x FROM T ORDER BY x;
# 		SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = x;
# 		SELECT DISTINCT x FROM T;
#
# However, with multiple operands, there can be ambiguity.
#
# For example:
#
# 		SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = 'Y';
#
# SHould the comparison use the collation of the column x, or of the string literal y?
#
# Both x and y have collations, so which one takes precedence?
#
# A mix of collations may also occur in contexts other than comparison.
#
# For example, a multiple-argument concatenation operation such as CONCAT(x, 'Y') combines
# its arguments to produce a single string.
#
# To resolve this, MySQL checks whether the collation of one item can be coerced to hte collation
# of the other.
#
# MySQL assigns coercibility values as follows:
#
# ) An explicit COLLATE clause has a coercibbility of 0 (not coercible at all)
#
# ) The concatenation of two strings with different collations has a coercibility of 1
#
# ) The collation of a column or a stored routine parameter or local variable has a coercibility of 2
#
# ) A "system constant" (the string returned by functions such as USER() or VERSION()) has a coercibility of 3
#
# ) The collation of a literal has a coercibility of 4
#
# ) The collation of a numeric or temporal value has a coercibility of 5
#
# ) NULL or an expression that is derived from NULL has a coercibility of 6
#
# MySQL uses the coercibility values within the following rules to resolve ambiguiteis:
#
# 	) Use the collation with the lowest coercibility value
#
# 	) If both sides have the same coercibility, then:
#
# 		) If both sides are Unicode, or both sides are not Unicode, it is an error.
#
# 		) If one of the sides has a Unicode character set, and another side has a non-Unicode character set,
# 			the side with Unicode char set wins, and automatic char set conversion is applied to the
# 			non-Unicode side.
#
# 			For example, the following statement does not retur nan error:
#
# 				SELECT CONCAT(utf8_column, latin1_column) FROM t1;
#
# 			It returns a result that has a character set of utf8 and the same collation
# 			as utf8_column.
#
# 			Values of latin1_column are automatically converted to utf8 before concatenating.
#
# 		) For an operation with operands from the same character set but that mix a _bin collation
# 			and a _ci or _cs collation, the _bin collation is used.
#
# 			THis is similar to how operations that mix nonbinary and binary strings,
# 			evaluate the operands as binary strings, excpet that it is for collations rather than data types.
#
# Although automatic conversion is not in the SQL standard, the standard does say that every character
# set is (in terms of supported characters) a "subset" of Unicode.
#
# BEcause it is well-known priciple that "what applies to a supsetcan apply to a subset";
# we belive that a collation for Unicode can apply for comparisons with non-Unicode strings.
#
# The following table illustrates some applications of hte preceding rules:
#
# 		COMPARISON 							COLLATION USED
#
# column1 = 'A' 					Use collation of column1
#
# column1 = 'A' COLLATE x 		Use collation of 'A' COLLATE x
#
# column1 COLLATE x = 'A' COLLATE Y    	Error
#
# To determine the coercibility of a string expression, use the COERCIBILITY() function,
# see SECTION 12.15 "INFORMATION FUNCTIONS"
#
# SELECT COERCIBILITY('A' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci);
# 		-> 0
# SELECT COERCIBILITY(VERSION());
# 		-> 3
# SELECT COERCIBILITY('A');
# 		-> 4
# SELECT COERCIBILITY(1000);
# 		-> 5
#
# For implicit conversion of a numeric or temporal value to a string, such as occurs
# for the argument 1 in the expression CONCAT(1, 'abc'), the result is a character (nonbinary)
# that has a character set and collation determined by the character_set_connection 
# and collation_connection system variables.
#
# See SECTION 12.2 "TYPE CONVERSION IN EXPRESSIONE VALUATION"
#
# THE BINARY COLLATION COMPARED TO _BIN COLLATIONS
#
# This section describes how the binary collation for binary strings
# compares to the _bin collations for nonbinary strings.
#
# Binary strings (as stored using the BINARY, VARBINARY, and BLOB data types) have a character
# set and collation named binary.
#
# Binary strings are sequences of bytes and the numeric values of those bytes determine
# comparison and sort order.
#
# Nonbinary strings (as stored using the CHAR, VARCHAR and TEXT data types) have a character
# and collation other than binary.
#
# A given nonbinary character set can ahve several collations, each of which defines a particular
# comparison and sort order for the characters in the set.
#
# One of these is the binary collation for the character set, indicated by a _bin suffix
# in the collation name.
#
# For example, the binary collations for latin1 and utf8 are named latin1_bin and utf8_bin, respectively.
#
# The binary collation differs from the _bin collations in several respects.
#
# The unit for comparison and sorting.
#
# Binary strings are sequenceso f bytes. For the binary collation, comparison and sortinga re based
# on numeric byte values.
#
# Nonbinary strings are sequences of characters, which might be multibyte. Collations for nonbinary strings
# defines an ordering of the character values for comparison and sorting.
#
# FOr the _bin collation, this ordering is based on numeric character code values, which is similar
# to ordering for binary strings except that character code values might be multibyte.
#
# Character set conversion.
#
# A nonbinary string has a character set and is automatically converted to another character
# set in many cases, even when the string has a _bin collation:
#
# 		) When assigning column values from another column that has a different character set:
#
# 			UPDATE t1 SET utf8_bin_column=latin1_column;
# 			INSERT INTO t1 (latin1_column) SELECT utf8_bin_column FROM t2;
#
# 		) When assigning column values for INSERT or UPDATE using a string literal:
#
# 			SET NAMES latin1;
# 			INSERT INTO t1 (utf8_bin_column) VALUES ('string-in-latin1');
#
# 		) When sending results from the server to a client:
#
# 			SET NAMES latin1;
# 			SELECT utf8_bin_column FROM t2;
#
# For binary string columns, no conversion occurs.
# For the preceding cases, the string value is copied byte-wise.
#
# Lettercase conversion. Collations for nonbinary character sets provide information
# about lettercase of characters, so characters in a nonbinary string can be converted
# from one lettercase to another, even for _bin collations that ignore lettercase for ordering:
# 				
#
#  	SET NAMES latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
# 		SELECT LOWER('aA'), UPPER('zZ');
# 		+-----------------+------------------+
# 		| LOWER('aA') 		| UPPER('zZ') 		 |
# 		+-----------------+------------------+
# 		| aa 					| ZZ 					 |
# 		+-----------------+------------------+
#
# The concept of lettercase does not apply to bytes in a binary string.
# To perform lettercase conversion, the string must be converted to a nonbinary string:
#
# 		SET NAMES binary;
# 		SELECT LOWER('aA'), LOWER(CONVERT('aA' USING latin1));
# 		+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
# 		| LOWER('aA') 	   | LOWER(CONVERT('aA' USING latin1)) |
# 		+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
# 		| aA 					| aa 											|
# 		+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
#
# Trailing space handling in comparisons.
#
# Most MySQL collations have a pad attribute of PAD SPACE.
# The exceptions are Unicode collations based on UCA 9.0.0 and higher, which have
# a pad attribute of NO PAD.
#
# (See SECTION 10.10.1, "UNICODE CHARACTER SETS")
#
# To determine the pad attribute for a collation, use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS
# table, which has a PAD_ATTRIBUTE column.
#
# The pad attribute determines how trailing spaces are treated for comparison of nonbinary
# strings (CHAR, VARCHAR and TEXT values)
#
# NO PAD collations treat spaces at the end of the string like any other character.
#
# For PAD SPACE collations, trailing spaces are insignificant in comparisons; strings
# are compared without regard to any trailing spaces:

# SET NAMES utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
# SELECT 'a ' = 'a';
#
# 	+--------------------+
# 	| 'a ' = 'a' 		   |
# 	+--------------------+
# 	| 			1 				|
# 	+--------------------+
#
# For binary strings, all characters are significant in comparisons, including trailing spaces:
#
# 	SET NAMES binary;
# 	SELECT 'a ' = 'a';
#
# 	+-----------------+
# 	| 'a ' = 'a' 		|
# 	+-----------------+
# 	| 		0 				|
# 	+-----------------+
#
# Trailing space handling for inserts and retrievals.
#
# CHAR(N) columns store nonbinary strings. Values shorter than N characters are extended
# with spaces on insertion.
#
# For retrieval, trailing spaces are removed.
#
# BINARY(N) columns store binary strings. Values shorter than N bytes are extended with
# 0x00 bytes on insertion.
#
# For retrieval, nothing is removed; a value of the declared length is always returned.
#
# CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 		a CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin,
# 		b BINARY(10)
# 	 );
# INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('a', 'a');
# SELECT HEX(a), HEX(b) FROM t1;
#
# +-------------+----------------------------+
# | HEX(a) 	    | HEX(b) 						   |
# +-------------+----------------------------+
# | 61 			 | 6100000000000000000000 		|
# +-------------+----------------------------+
#
# EXAMPLES OF THE EFFECT OF COLLATION
#
# EXAMPLE 1: Sorting German Umlauts
#
# Suppose that column X in table T has these latin1 column values:
#
# 		Muffler
# 		Müller
# 		MX Systems
# 		MySQL
#
# Suppose also that the column values are retrieved using the following statement:
#
# 		SELECT X FROM T ORDER BY X COLLATE collation_name;
#
# The following table shows the resulting order of the values if we use ORDER BY with
# different collations.
#
# latin1_swedish_ci 		latin1_german1_ci 		latin1_german2_ci
# Muffler 					Muffler 						Müller
# MX Systems 				Müller 						Muffler
# Müller 					MX Systems 					MX Systems
# MySQL 						MySQL 						MySQL
#
# The character that causes the different sort orders in this example is the U (Ü), which is the "U-umlaut"
#
# 		) The first column shows the result of the SELECT using the Swedish/Finnish collating rule, which says that
# 			U-umlaut sorts with Y
#
# 		) The second column shows the result of the SELECT using the German DIN-1 rule, which says that U-umlaut sorts with U
#
# 		) The third column shows the result of the SELECT using the German DIN-2 rule, which says that U-umlaut sorts with UE
#
# EXAMPLE 2: SEARCHING FOR GERMAN UMLAUTS
#
# SUppose that you have three tables that differ only by the character set and collation used:
#
# 		SET NAMES utf8;
# 		CREATE TABLE german1 (
# 			c CHAR(10)
# 		) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
#
# 		CREATE TABLE german2 (
# 			c CHAR(10)
# 		) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
#
# 		CREATE TABLE germanutf8 (
# 			c CHAR(10)
# 		) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
#
# Each table contains two records:
#
# 		INSERT INTO german1 VALUES ('Bar'), ('Bör');
# 		INSERT INTO german2 VALUES ('Bar'), ('Bör');
# 		INSERT INTO germanutf8 VALUES ('Bar'), ('Bär');
#
# Two of the above collations have an A = Ä equality, and one has no such equality
# (latin1_german2_ci)
#
# For that reason, you'll get these results in comparisons:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM german1 WHERE c = 'Bär';
# 		+-----------+
# 		| c 			|
# 		+-----------+
# 		| Bar 		|
# 		| Bär 		|
# 		+-----------+
#
# 		SELECT * FROM german2 WHERE c = 'Bör';
# 		+-----------+
# 		| c 			|
# 		+-----------+
# 		| Bär 		|
# 		+-----------+
#
# 		SELECT * FROM germanutf8 WHERE c = 'Bär';
# 		+------------+
# 		| c 			 |
# 		+------------+
# 		| Bar 		 |
# 		| Bär 		 |
# 		+------------+
#
# This is not a bug rather a consequence of the sorting properties of latin1_german1_ci and
# utf8_unicode_ci (the sorting shown is done according to the German DIN 5007 standard)
#
# USING COLLATION IN INFORMATION_SCHEMA SEARCHES
#
# String columns in INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables have a collation of utf8_general_ci, which is
# case insensitive.
#
# However, for valuews that correspond to objects that are represented in the file system,
# such as databases and tables, searches in INFORMATION_SCHEMA string columns can be 
# case-sensitive or insensitive, depending on the characteristics of the underlying file system
# and the lower_case_table_names system variable setting.
#
# For example, searches may be case-sensitive if the file system is case-sensitive.
#
# This section describes this behavior and how to modify it if necessary.
#
# Suppose that a query searches the SCHEMATA.SCHEMA_NAME column for the test database.
#
# On Linux, file systems are case-sensitive, so comparisons of SCHEMATA.SCHEMA_NAME with
# 'test' match, but comparisons with 'TEST' do not:
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'test';
# 		+----------------+
# 		| SCHEMA_NAME 	  |
# 		+----------------+
# 		| test 		 	  |
# 		+----------------+
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'TEST';
# 		Empty set (0.00 sec)
#
# These results occur if the lower_case_table_names system variable set to 0.
#
# A lower_case_table_names setting 1 or 2 causes the secondary query to return the
# same (nonempty) results as the first query.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		It is prohibited to start the server with a lower_case_table_names setting that is different
# 		from the setting used when the server was initialized.
#
# On Windows or macOS, file systems are not case-sensitive, so comparisons match both
# 'test' and 'TEST':
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'test';
# 		+---------------+
# 		| SCHEMA_NAME 	 |
# 		+---------------+
# 		| test 			 |
# 		+---------------+
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'TEST';
# 		+---------------+
# 		| SCHEMA_NAME 	 |
# 		+---------------+
# 		| TEST 			 |
# 		+---------------+
#
# The value of lower_case_table_names makes no difference in this context.
#
# The preceding behavior occurs because the utf8_general_ci collation is not used for
# INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries when searching for values that correspond to objects
# represented in the file system.
#
# If the result of a string operation on an INFORMATION_SCHEMA column differs from expectations,
# a workaround is to use an explicit COLLATE clause to force a suitable collation.
#
# See SECTION 10.8.1, "USING COLLATE IN SQL STATEMENTS"
#
# For example, to perform a case-insensitive search, use COLLATE with the INFORMATION_SCHEMA
# column name:
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
# 		WHERE SCHEMA_NAME COLLATE utf8_general_ci = 'test';
# 		+-------------------+
# 		| SCHEMA_NAME 		  |
# 		+-------------------+
# 		| test 				  |
# 		+-------------------+
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
# 		WHERE SCHEMA_NAME COLLATE utf8_general_ci = 'TEST';
# 		+-------------------+
# 		| SCHEMA_NAME 		  |
# 		+-------------------+
# 		| test 				  |
# 		+-------------------+
#
# You can also use the UPPER() or LOWER() function:
#
# 		WHERE UPPER(SCHEMA_NAME) = 'TEST'
# 		WHERE LOWER(SCHEMA_NAME) = 'test'
#
# Although a case-insensitive comparison can be performed even on platforms with
# case-sensitive file systems, as just shown, it is not necessarily always the right
# thing to do.
#
# On such platforms, it is possible to have multiple objects with names that differ only
# in lettercase.
#
# For example, tables named city, CITY and City can all exist simultaneously.
#
# Consider whether a search should match all such names or just one and write queries
# accordingly.
#
# The first of the following comparisons (with utf8_bin) is case sensitive;
# the others are not:
#
# 		WHERE TABLE_NAME COLLATE utf8_bin = 'City'
# 		WHERE TABLE_NAME COLLATE utf8_general_ci = 'city'
# 		WHERE UPPER(TABLE_NAME) = 'CITY'
# 		WHERE LOWER(TABLE_NAME) = 'city'
#
# Searches in INFORMATION_SCHEMA string columns for values that refer to INFORMATION_SCHEMA itself
# do use the utf8_general_ci collation because INFORMATION_SCHEMA is a "virtual" database not represented
# in the file system.
#
# For example, comparisons with SCHEMATA.SCHEMA_NAME match 'information_schema' or 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'
# regardless of platform:
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
# 		WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'information_schema';
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| SCHEMA_NAME 			 |
# 		+---------------------+
# 		| information_schema  |
# 		+---------------------+
#
# 		SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
# 		WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA';
# 		+----------------------+
# 		| SCHEMA_NAME 			  |
# 		+----------------------+
# 		| information_schema   |
# 		+----------------------+
#
# UNICODE SUPPORT
#
# The Unicode Standard includes characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) and supplementary
# characters that lie outside the BMP.
#
# This section describes support for Unicode in MySQL. For information about the Unicode Standard itself,
# visit the Unicode Consortium website.
#
# BMP characters have these characteristics:
#
# 		) Their code point values are between 0 and 65535 (or U+0000 and U+FFFF)
#
# 		) They can be encoded in a variable-length encoding using 8, 16, or 24 bits (1 to 3 bytes)
#
# 		) They can be encoded in a fixed-length encoding using 16 bits (2 bytes)
#
# 		) They are sufficient for almost all characters in major languages.
#
# Supplementary characters lie outside the BMP:
#
# 		) Their code point values are between U+10000 AND U+10FFFF
#
# 		) Unicode support for supplementary characters requires character sets that have a range outside
# 			BMP characters and therefore take more space than BMP characters (up to 4 bytes per character)
#
# The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format with 8-bit units) method for encoding Unicode data is implemented
# according to RFC 3629, which describes encoding sequences that take from one to four bytes.
#
# The idea of UTF-8 is that various Unicode characters are encoded using byte sequences of different lengths:
#
# 		) Basic Latin letters, digits, and punctuation signs use one byte.
#
# 		) Most European and Middle East script letters fit into a 2-byte sequence:
#
# 			extended Latin letters (with tilde, macron, acute, grave and other accents), Cyrillic,
# 			Greek, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac and others.
#
# 		) Korean, Chinese, and Japanese ideographs use 3-byte or 4-byte sequences.
#
# MySQL supports these Unicode character sets:
#
# 		) utf8mb4: A UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set using one to four bytes per character.
#
# 		) utf8mb3: A UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set using one to three bytes per character.
#
# 		) utf8: An alias for utf8mb3
#
# 		) ucs2: The UCS-2 encoding of the Unicode character set using two bytes per character.
#
# 		) utf16: The UTF-16 encoding for the Unicode character set using two or four bytes per character.
#
# 				Like ucs2 but with an extension for supplementary characters.
#
# 		) utf16le: The UTF-16LE encoding for the Unicode character set.
#
# 				Like utf16 but little-endian rather than big-endian.
#
# 		) utf32: The UTF-32 encoding for the Unicode character set using four bytes per character.
#
# 			NOTE:
#
# 				The utf8mb3 character set is deprecated and will be removed in a future MySQL release.
#
# 				Please use utf8mb4 instead. although utf8 is currently an alias for utf8mb3, it will be a reference to utf8mb4.
#
# 				To avoid ambiguity about the meaning of utf8, consider specifying utf8mb4 explicitly for character
# 				set references instead of utf8.
#
# TABLE 10.2, "UNICODE CHARACTER SET GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS", summarizes the general characteristics of Unicode characters
# sets supported by MySQL.
#
# TABLE 10.2 UNICODE CHARACTER SET GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
#
# CHARACTER SET 		SUPPORTED CHARACTERS 				REQUIRED STORAGE PER CHARACTER
#
# utf8mb3, utf8 		BMP only 								1, 2, or 3 bytes
#
# ucs2 					BMP only 								2 bytes
#
# utf8mb4 				BMP and supplementary 				1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes
#
# utf16 					BMP and supplementary 				2 or 4 bytes
#
# utf16le 				BMP and supplementary 				2 or 4 bytes
#
# utf32 					BMP and supplementary 				4 bytes
#
# Characters outside the BMP compare as REPLACEMENT CHARACTER and convert to '?' when converted to a Unicode
# character set that supports only BMP characters (utf8mb3 or ucs2)
#
# If you use character sets that support supplementary characters and thus are "wider" than the BMP-only
# utf8mb3 and ucs2 character sets, there are potential incompatibility issues for your applications;
#
# See SECTION 10.9.8, "CONVERTING BETWEEN 3-BYTE AND 4-BYTE UNICODE CHARACTER SETS"
#
# That section also describes how to convert tables from the (3-byte) utf8mb3 to the (4-byte)
# utf8mb4, and what constraints may apply in doing so.
#
# A similar set of collations is available for most Unicode character sets.
#
# For example, each has a Danish collation, the names of which are utf8mb4_danish_ci,
# utf8mb3_danish_ci, utf8_danish_ci, ucs2_danish_ci, utf16_danish_ci and utf32_danish_ci.
#
# The exception is utf16le, which has only two collations.
#
# For information about Unicode collations and their differentiating properties, including
# collation properties for supplementary characters, see SECTION 10.10.1, "UNICODE CHARACTER SETS"
#
# The MySQL implementation of UCS-2, UTF-16 and UTF-32 stores characters in big-endian byte
# order and does not use a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of values.
#
# Other database systems might use little-endian byte order or a BOM.
#
# In such cases, conversion of values will need to be performed when transferring data between
# those systems and MySQL.
#
# The implementation of UTF-16LE is little-endian
#
# MySQL uses no BOM for UTF-8 values.
#
# Client applications that communicate with the server using Unicode should set the
# client character set accordingly; for example, by issuing a SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' statement.
#
# Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set.
# Attempting to use them with SET_NAMES or SET_CHARACTER_SET produces an error.
#
# See IMPERMISSIBLE CLIENT CHARACTER SETS.
#
# The following sections provide additional detail on the Unicode character sets
# in MySQL.
#
# THE UTF8MB4 CHARACTER SET (4-BYTE UTF-8 UNICODE ENCODING)
#
# The utf8mb4 character set has these characteristics:
#
# 		) Supports BMP and supplementary characters
#
# 		) Requires a maximum of four bytes per multibyte character.
#
# utf8mb4 contrasts with the utf8mb3 character set, which supports only BMP characters
# and uses a maximum of three bytes per character:
#
# 		) For a BMP character, utf8mb4 and utf8mb3 have identical storage characteristics: same code values,
# 			same encoding, same length.
#
# 		) For a supplementary character, utf8mb4 requires four bytes to store it, whereas utf8mb3 cannot store the
# 			character at all.
#
# 			When converting utf8mb3 columns to utf8mb4, you need not worry about converting supplementary characters
# 			because there will be none.
#
# utf8mb4 is a superset of utf8mb3, so for an opperation such as the following concatenation, the result
# has character set utf8mb4 and the collation of utf8mb4_col:
#
# 		SELECT CONCAT(utf8mb3_col, utf8mb4_col);
#
# Similarly, the following comparison in the WHERE clause works according to the collation of utf8mb4_col:
#
# 		SELECT * FROM utf8mb3_tbl, utf8mb4_tbl
# 		WHERE utf8mb3_tbl.utf8mb3_col = utf8mb4_tbl.utf8mb4_col;
#
# For information about data type storage as it relates to multibyte character sets,
# see STRING TYPE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS.
#
# THE UTF8MB3 CHARACTER SET (3-BYTE UTF-8 UNICODE ENCODING
#
# The utf8mb3 character set has these characteristics:
#
# 		) Supports BMP characters only (no support for supplementary characters)
#
# 		) Requires a maximum of three bytes per multibyte character.
#
# Applications that use UTF-8 data but require supplementary character support should use
# utf8mb4 rather than utf8mb3 (see SECTION 10.9.1, "THE UTF8MB4 CHARACTER SET (4-BYTE UTF-8 UNICODE ENCODING)"
#
# Exactly the same set of characters is available in utf8mb3 and ucs2. That is, they have the same repetoire.
#
# utf8 is an alias for utf8mb3; the character limit is implicit, rather than explicit in the name.
#
# 		NOTE:
#
# 			The utf8mb3 character set is deprecated and will be removed in a future MySQL release.
#
# 			Please use utf8mb4 instead. Although utf8 is currently an alias for utf8mb3, at that
# 			point utf8 will become a reference to utf8mb4.
#
# 			To avoid ambiguity about the meaning of utf8, consider specifying utf8mb4 explicitly
# 			for character set references instead of utf8.
#
# utf8mb3 can be used in CHARACTER SET clauses, and utf8mb3_collation_substring in COLLATE clauses,
# where collation_substring is bin, czech_ci, danish_ci, esperanto_ci, estonian_ci and so forth.
#
# For example:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t (s1 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3;
# 		SELECT * FROM t WHERE s1 COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci = 'x';
#
# 		DECLARE x VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_danish_ci;
# 		SELECT CAST('a' AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8) COLLATE utf8_czech_ci;
#
# MySQL immediately converts instances of utf8mb3 in statements to utf8, so in statements
# such as SHOW CREATE TABLE or SELECT CHARACTER_SET_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
# or SELECT COLLATION_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS, users will see the name 
# utf8 or utf8_collation_substring.
#
# utf8mb3 is also valid in contexts other than CHARACTER SET clauses.
#
# For example:
#
# 		mysqld --character-set-server=utf8mb3
#
# 		SET NAMES 'utf8mb3'; /* and other SET statements that have similar effect */
# 		SELECT _utf8mb3 'a';
#
# For information about data type storage as it relates to multibyte character sets,
# see STRING TYPE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS.
#
# THE UTF8 CHARACTER SET (ALIAS FOR UTF8MB3)
#
# utf8 is an alias for the utf8mb3 character set.
#
# For more information, see SECTION 10.9.2, "THE UTF8MB3 CHARACTER SET (3-BYTE UTF-8 UNICODE ENCODING"
#
# 		NOTE:
#
# 			The utf8mb3 character set is deprecated, etc. - use utf8mb4 explicitly 
#
# THE UCS2 CHARACTER SET (UCS-2 UNICODE ENCODING)
#
# In UCS-2, every character is represented by a 2-byte Unicode code with the most significant byte first.
#
# For example: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A has the code 0x0041 and it is stored as a 2-byte sequence:
#
# 		0x00 0x41
#
# CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER YERU (Unicode 0x044B) is stored as a 2-byte sequence: 0x04 0x4B
#
# For Unicode characters and their codes, please refer to the Unicode Consortium website.
#
# The ucs2 character set has these characteristics:
#
# 		) Supports BMP characters only (no support for supplementary characters)
#
# 		) Uses a fixed-length 16-bit encoding and requires two bytes per character.
#
# THE UTF16 CHARACTER SET (UTF-16 UNICODE ENCODING)
#
# The utf16 character set is the ucs2 character set with an extension that enables
# encoding of supplementary characters:
#
# 		) For a BMP character, utf16 and ucs2 have identical storage characteristics: same code values, same encoding,
# 			same length.
#
# 		) For a supplementary character, utf16 has a special sequence for representing the character using 32 bits.
#
# 			This is called the "surrogate" mechanism: For a number greater than 0xffff, take 10 bits and add them
# 			to 0xd800 and put them in the first 16-bit word, take 10 more bits and add them to 0xdc00 and pput them
# 			in the next 16-bit word.
#
# 			Consequently, all supplementary characters requires 32 bits, where the first 16 bits are a number between
# 			0xd800 and 0xdbff, and the last 16 bits are a number between 0xdc00 and 0xdfff
#
# 			Examples are in SECTION 15.5 SURROGATES AREA of the Unicode 4.0 document
#
# Because utf16 supports surrogates and ucs2 does not, there is a validity check that applies only in utf16:
#
# 		You cannot insert a top surrogate without a bottom surrogate, or vice versa.
#
# For example:
#
# 		INSERT INTO t (ucs2_column) VALUES (0xd800); /* legal */
# 		INSERT INTO t (utf16_column) VALUES (0xd800); /* Illegal */
#
# There is no validity check for characters that are technically valid, but are not true
# Unicode (that is, characters that Unicode considers to be "unassigned code points" or "private use" characters
# or even "illegals")
#
#
# Because MySQL must allow for the worst case (that one character requires four bytes) the maximum length
# of a utf16 column or index is only half of the maximum length for a ucs2 column or index.
#
# For example, the maximum length of a MEMORY table index key is 3072 bytes, so these statements
# create tables with the longest permitted indexes for ucs2 and utf16 columns:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE tf (s1 VARCHAR(1536) CHARACTER SET ucs2) ENGINE=MEMORY;
# 		CREATE INDEX i ON tf (s1);
#
# 		CREATE TABLE tg (s1 VARCHAR(768) CHARACTER SET utf16) ENGINE=MEMORY;
# 		CREATE INDEX i ON tg (s1);
#
# THE UTF16LE CHARACTER SET (UTF-16LE UNICODE ENCODING)
#
# This is the same as utf16 but is little-endian rather than big-endian.
#
# THE UTF32 CHARACTER SET (UTF-32 UNICODE ENCODING)
#
# The utf32 character set is fixed length (like ucs2 and unlike utf16).
#
# utf32 uses 32 bits for every character, unlike ucs2 (which uses 16 bits for every character),
# and unlike utf16 (which uses 16 bits for some characters and 32 bits for others)
#
# utf32 takes twice as much space as ucs2 and more space than utf16, but utf32 has teh same
# advantage as ucs2 that it is predictable for storage:
#
# 		The required number of bytes for utf32 equals the number of characters times 4.
#
# Also, unlike utf16, there are no tricks for encoding in utf32, so the stored value
# equals the code value.
#
# To demonstrate how the latter advantage is useful, here is an example that shows how
# to determine a utf8mb4 value given the utf32 code value:
#
# 		/* Assume code value = 100cc LINEAR B WHEELED CHARIOT */
# 		CREATE TABLE tmp (utf32_col CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET utf32,
# 								utf8mb4_col CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4);
#
# 		INSERT INTO tmp VALUES (0x000100cc, NULL);
# 		UPDATE tmp SET utf8mb4_col = utf32_col;
# 		SELECT HEX(utf32_col), HEX(utf8mb4_col) FROM tmp;
#
# MySQL is very forgiving about additions of unassigned Unicode characters or private-use-area
# characters.
#
# There is in fact only one validity check for utf32; No code value may be greater than
# 0x10ffff
#
# For example, this is illegal:
#
# 		INSERT INTO t (utf32_column) VALUES (0x110000); /* illegal */
#
# CONVERTING BETWEEN 3-BYTE AND 4-BYTE UNICODE CHARACTER SETS
#
# This section describes issues that you may face when converting character data between
# the utf8mb3 and utf8mb4 character sets.
#
# 		NOTE:
#
# 			This discussion focuses primarily on converting between utf8mb3 and utf8mb4, but similar principles
# 			apply to converting between the ucs2 character set and character sets such as utf16 or utf32.
#
# The utf8mb3 and utf8mb4 character sets differ as follows:
#
# 		) utf8mb3 supports only characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
#
# 			utf8mb4 additionally supports supplementary characters that lie outside the BMP.
#
# 		) utf8mb3 uses a maximum of three bytes per character. utf8mb4 uses a maximum of four bytes per character.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		This discussion refers to the utf8mb3 and utf8mb4 character set names to be explicit about
# 		referring to 3-byte and 4-byte UTF-8 character set data.
#
# 		The exception is that in table definitions, utf8 is used because MySQL converts instances of
# 		utf8mb3 specified in such definitions to utf8, which is an alias for utf8mb3.
#
# One advantage of converting from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4 is that this enables applications to use
# supplementary characters.
#
# One tradeoff is that this may increase data storage space requirements.
#
# In terms of table content, conversion from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4 presents no problems:
#
# 		) For a BMP character, utf8mb4 and utf8mb3 have identical storage characteristics; same code values, same encoding, same length
#
# 		) For a supplementary character, utf8mb4 requires four bytes to store it, whereas utf8mb3 cannot store the character at all.
#
# 			When converting utf8mb3 columns to utf8mb4, you need not worry about converting supplementary characters because there will be none.
#
# In terms of table structure, these are the primary potentional incompatibilities:
#
# 		) For the variable-length character data types (VARCHAR and the TEXT types), the maximum permitted length
# 			in characters is less for utf8mb4 columns than for utf8mb3 columns.
#
# 		) For all character data types (CHAR, VARCHAR and the TEXT types), the maximum number of characters that can be
# 			indexed is less for utf8mb4 columns than for utf8mb3 columns.
#
# Consequently, to convert tables from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4, it may be necessary to change some column or index
# definitions.
#
# Tables can be converted from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4 by using ALTER_TABLE. Suppose that a table has this definition:
#
# 		CREATE TABLE t1 (
# 			col1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
# 			col2 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL
# 		) CHARACTER SET utf8;
#
# The following statement converts t1 to use utf8mb4:
#
# 		ALTER TABLE t1
# 			DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4,
# 			MODIFY col1 CHAR(10)
# 				CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
# 			MODIFY col2 CHAR(10)
# 				CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin NOT NULL;
#
# The catch when converting from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4 is that the maximum length of a column or index key
# is unchanged in terms of bytes.
#
# Therefore, it is smaller in terms of characters because the maximum length of a character
# is four bytes instead of three.
#
# For the CHAR, VARCHAR and TEXT data types, watch for these issues when converting your MySQL tables:
#
# 		) Check all definitions of utf8mb3 columns and make sure they will not exceed the maximum length for the storage engine.
#
# 		) Check all indexes on utf8mb3 columns and make sure they will not exceed the maximum length for the storage engine.
#
# 			Sometimes the maximum can change due to storage engine enhancements.
#
# If the preceding conditions apply, you must either reduce the defined length of columns or indexes,
# or continue to use utf8mb3 rather than utf8mb4.
#
# Here are some examples where structural changes may be needed:
#
# 		) a TINYTEXT column can hold up to 255 bytes, so it can hold up to 85 3-byte or 63 4-byte characters.
#
# 			Suppose that you have a TINYTEXT column that uses utf8mb3 but must be able to contain more than
# 			63 chars.
#
# 			YOu cannot convert it to utf8mb4 unless you also change the data type to a longer type such as TEXT.
#
# 			Similarly, a very long VARCHAR column may need to be changed to one of the longer TEXT types if you
# 			want to convert it from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4
#
# 		) InnoDB has a maximum index length of 767 bytes for tables that use COMPACT or REDUNDANT row format, so for
# 			utf8mb3 or utf8mb4 columns, you can index a maximum of 255 or 191 characters, respectively.
#
# 			If you currently have utf8mb3 columns with indexes longer than 191 characters, you must
# 			index a smaller number of characters.
#
# 			In an InnoDB table that uses COMPACT or REDUNDANT row format, these column and index definitions are legal:
#
# 				col1 VARCHAR(500) CHARACTER SET utf8, INDEX (col1(255))
#
# 			To use utf8mb4 instead, the index must be smaller:
#
# 				col1 VARCHAR(500) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4, INDEX (col1(191))
#
# 				NOTE:
#
# 					For InnoDB tables that use COMPRESSED or DYNAMIC row format, index key prefixes longer
# 					than 767 bytes (up to 3072 bytes) are permitted.
#
# 					Tables created with these row formats enable you to index a maximum of 1024 or 768 characters
# 					for utf8mb3 or utf8mb4 columns, respectively.
#
# 					For related information, see SECTION 15.6.1.7 "LIMITS ON INNODB TABLES"
#
# 					and
#
# 					SECTION 15.10.3 "DYNAMIC AND COMPRESSED ROW FORMATS"
#
# The preceding types of changes are most likely to be required only if you have very long columns or indexes.
#
# Otherwise, you should be able to convert your tables from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4 without problems,
# using ALTER_TABLE as described previously.
#
# The following items summarize other potential incompatibilities:
#
# 		) SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' causes use of the 4-byte character set for connection character sets.
#
# 			As long as no 4-byte characters are sent from the server, there should be
# 			no problems.
#
# 			Otherwise, applications that expect to receive a maximum of three bytes per character
# 			may have problems.
#
# 			Conversely, applications that expect to send 4-byte characters must ensure that the server understands them.
#
# 		) For replication, if character sets that support supplementary characters are to be used on the master,
# 			all slaves must understand them as well.
#
# 			Also, keep in mind the general principle that if a table has different definitions on the master and slave,
# 			this can lead to unexpected results.
#
# 			For example, the differences in maximum index key length make it risky to use utf8mb3 on the master
# 			and utf8mb4 on the slave.
#
# If you have converted to utf8mb4, utf16, utf16le or utf32, and then decide to convert back to utf8mb3
# or ucs2 (for example, to downgrade to an older version of MysQL), these considerations apply:
#
# 		) utf8mb3 and ucs2 data should present no problems.
#
# 		) The server must be recent enough to recognize definitions referring to the character set
# 			from which you are converting.
#
# 		) For object definitions that refer to the utf8mb4 character set, you can dump them with mysqldump
# 			prior to downgrading, eidt the dump file to change instances of utf8mb4 to utf8, and reload the
# 			file in the older server, as long as there are no 4-byte characters in the data.
#
# 			The older server will see utf8 in the dump file object definitions and create new objects
# 			that use the (3-byte) utf8 character set.

# In cases where a character set has multiple collations, it might not be clear which collation is most suitable
# for a given application.
#
# To avoid choosing the wrong collation, it can be helpful to perform some comparisons with representative data values to make sure
# that a given collation sorts values the way you expect.
#
# UNICODE CHARACTER SETS
#
# MySQL supports multiple Unicode character sets:
#
# 		) utf8mb4: A UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set using one to four bytes per character
#
# 		) utf8mb3: A UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set using one to three bytes per character
#
# 		) utf8: An alias for utf8mb3
#
# 		) ucs2: The UCS-2 encoding of the Unicode character set using two bytes per  character.
#
# 		) utf16: The uTF-16 encoding for the Unicode character set using two or four bytes per character.
# 		
# 					Like ucs2 but with an extension for supplementary characters.
#
# 		) utf16le: The UTF-16LE encoding for the Unicode character set. Like utf16 but little-endian rather than big-endian
#
# 		) utf32: The UTF-32 encoding for the Unicode character set using four bytes per character
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The utf8mb3 character set is deprecated, use explicit reference to utf8mb4 instead.
#
# utf8 and ucs2 support Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) characters.
# utf8mb4, utf16, utf16le and utf32 support BMP and supplementary characters.
#
# This section describes the collations available for Unicode character sets and their
# differentiating properties.
#
# For general information about Unicode, see SECTION 10.9, "UNICODE SUPPORT"
#
# Most Unicode character sets have a general collation (indicated by _general in the name or by
# the absence of a language specifier), a binary collation (indicated by _bin in the name),
# and several language-specific collations (indicated by language specifiers).
#
# For example, for utf8, utf8_general_ci and utf8_bin are its general and binary collations,
# and utf8_danish_ci is one of its language-specific collations.
#
# Collation support for utf16le is limited.
#
# The only collations available are utf16le_general_ci and utf16le_bin.
#
# These are similar to utf16_general_ci and utf16_bin
#
# A locale code or language name shown in the following table indicates a language-specific
# collation.
#
# Unicode character sets may include collations for one or more of these languages.
#
# TABLE 10.3 UNICODE COLLATION LANGUAGE SPECIFIERS
#
# 	Language 				Language Specifier
#
# Classical Latin 		la or roman
#
# Croatian 					hr or croatian
#
# Czech 						cs or czech
#
# Danish 					da or danish
#
# Esperanto 				eo or esperanto
#
# Estonian 					et or estonian
#
# German phone book 		de_pb or german2
# order
#
# Hungarian 				hu or hungarian
#
# Icelandic 				is or icelandic
#
# Japanese 					ja
#
# Latvian 					lv or latvian
#
# Lithuanian 				lt or lithuanian
#
# Persian 					persian
#
# Polish 					pl or polish
#
# Romanian 					ro or romanian
#
# Russian 					ru
#
# Sinhala 					sinhala
#
# Slovak 					sk or slovak
#
# Slovenian 				sl or slovenian
#
# Modern Spanish 			es or spanish
#
# Traditional Spanish 	es_trad or spanish2
#
# Swedish 					sv or Swedish
#
# Turkish 					tr or turkish
#
# Vietnamese 				vi or vietnamese
#
# Croatian collations are tailored for specific Croatian letters.
#
# Danish collations may also be used for Norweigan.
#
# For japanese, the utf8mb4 character set includes utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs and utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs_ks collations.
#
# Both collations are accent sensitive and case-sensitive.
#
# utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs_ks is also kana sensitive and distinguishes Katakana characters
# from Hiragana characters, whereas utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs treats Katakana and Hiragana
# characters as equal for sorting.
#
# Applications that require Japanese collation but not kana sensitivity may use utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs
# for better sort performance.
#
# utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs uses three weight levels for sorting: utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs_ks uses four.
#
# For Classical Latin collations that are accent insensitive, I and J compare as equal, and U
# and V compare as equal.
#
# I and J, U and V compare as equal on the base letter level.
#
# IN other words, J is regarded as an accented I, and U is regarded as an accented V.
#
# Spanish collations are available for modern and traditional Spanish.
# For both n-tilde is a separate letter between n and o.
#
# In addition, for traditional Spanish, ch is separate letter between
# c and d, and ll is a separate letter between l and m.
#
# Traditional Spanish collations may also be used for Austrian and Galician.
#
# Swedish collations include Swedish rules. For example, in Swedish, the following relationship
# holds, which is not something expected by German or French:
#
# 		Ü = Y < Ö
#
# FOr questions about particular langauge orderings, unicode provides Common Locale Data
# Repositories (CLDR) collation charts.
#
# The xxx_general_mysql500_ci collations preserve the pre-5.1.24 ordering of the original
# xxx_general_ci collations and permits upgrades for tables created before 5.1.24 (A bug, #27877)
#
# MySQL implements the xxx_unicode_ci collations according to the Unicode Collation Algorithm
# (UCA).
#
# The collation uses the version-4.0.0 UCA weight keys.
#
# The xxx_unicode_ci collations have only partial support for the Unicode Collation Algorithm.
#
# Some characters are not supported, and combining marks are not fully supported.
#
# This affects primarily  Vietnamese, Yoruba and some smaller languages such as Navajo.
#
# A combined character is considered different from the same character written with a single
# unicode character in string comparisons, and the two characters are considered to have
# a different length (for example, as returned by the CHAR_LENGTH() function or in result set metadata)
#
# Unicode collations based on UCA versions later than 4.0.0 include the version in the
# collation name.
#
# Thus, utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci is based on UCA 5.2.0 weight keys, where as utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
# is based on UCA 9.0.0 weight keys
#
# Collations based on UCA 9.0.0 and higher are faster than collations based on UCA versions below
# 9.0.0
#
# They also have a PAD attribute of NO PAD, in contrast to PAD SPACE as used in collations
# based on UCA versions below 9.0.0
#
# NO PAD collations treat spaces at the end of the strings like any other character.
#
# To determine the pad attribute for a collation, use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS
# table, which has a PAD_ATTRIBUTE column.
#
# Comparisons of VARCHAR columns that have a NO PAD collation differ from other collations
# with respect to trailing spaces.
#
# For example, 'a' and 'a ' compare as different strings, not the same string.
#
# MySQL implements language-specific Unicode collations if the ordering based only on
# UCA does not work well for a language.
#
# Language-specific collations are UCA-based, with additional language tailoring rules.
#
# For example, the nonlanguage-specific utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci and language-specific utf8mb4_LOCALE_0900_ai_ci
# Unicode collations each have these characteristics:
#
# 		) The collation is based on Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) 9.0.0 and Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)v30,
# 			is accent insensitive and case insensitive.
#
# 			These characteristics are indicated by _0900_ai and _ci in the collation name.
#
# 			Exception: utf8mb4_la_0900_ai_ci is not based on CLDR because Classical Latin is not definded in CLDR.
#
# 		) The collation works for all characters in the range [U+0, U+10FFFF]
#
# 		) If the collation is not language specific, it sorts all characters, including supplementary characters,
# 			in default order (described following).
#
# 			If the collation is language specific, it sorts characters of the language correctly according to
# 			to language-specific rules, and characters not in the language in default order.
#
# 		) By default, the collation sorts characters having a code point listed in teh DUCET table (Default Unicode Collation Element Table)
# 			according to the weight value assigned in the table.
#
# 			The collation sorts characters not having a code point listed in the DUCET table using their
# 			implicit weight value, which is constructed according to the UCA.
#
# 		) For non-language-specific collations, characters in contraction sequences are treated as separate characters.
#
# 			For language-specific collations, contractions might change character sorting order.
#
# LOWER() and UPPER() perform case folding according to the collation of their argument.
#
# A character that has uppercase and lowercase versions only in a Unicode version more recent
# than 4.0.0 is converted by these functions only if the argument has a collation that uses a 
# recent enough UCA version.
#
# For any Unicode character set, operations performed using the xxx_general_ci collation are
# faster than those for the xxx_unicode_ci collation.
#
# For example, comparisons for the utf8_general_ci collation are faster, but slightly less correct,
# than comparisons for utf8_unicode_ci.
#
# The reason for this is that utf8_unicode_ci supports mapping such as expansions; that is, when one
# character compares as equal to combinations of other characters.
#
# For example, in German and some other language the german S is equal to ss.
#
# utf8_unicode_ci also supports contractions and ignorable characters.
#
# utf8_general_ci is a legacy collation that does not support expansions,
# contractions, or ignorable characters.
#
# It can make only one-to-one comparisons between characters.
#
# To further illustrate, the following equalities hold in both utf8_general_ci and utf8_unicode_ci
# (for the effect of this in comparisons or searches, see SECTION 10.8.6 "EXAMPLES OF THE EFFECT OF COLLATION"):
#
# 		Ä = A
# 		Ö = O
# 		Ü = U
#
# A difference between collations is that htis is true for utf8_general_ci:
#
# 		[german s] = s
#
# Whereas this is  true for utf8_unicode_ci, which supports the German DIN-1 ordering
# (also known as dictionary order):
#
# 		[german s] = ss
#
# MySQL implements utf8 language-specific collations if the ordering with utf8_unicode_ci does not
# work well for a language.
#
# For example, utf8_unicode_ci works fine for German dictionary order and French, so there is no
# need to create special utf8 collations.
#
# utf8_general_ci also is satisfactory for both German and French, except that [german s] is equal
# to s and not ss.
#
# If this is acceptable in the app, you should use utf8_general_ci because its faster.
#
# If this is not acceptable, i.e, requiring German dictionary order, use utf8_unicode_ci because
# it is more accurate.
#
# If you require German DIN-2 (phone book) ordering, use the utf8_german2_ci collation,
# which compares the following sets of characters equal:
#
# 		Ä = [AE] = AE
# 		Ö = [OE] = OE
# 		Ü = UE
# 		[German S] = ss
#
# utf8_german2_ci is similar to latin1_german2_ci, but hte latter does not compare [AE] equal
# to AE or [OE] equal to OE.
#
# There is no utf8_german_ci corresponding to latin1_german_ci for German dictionary order
# because utf8_general_ci suffices.
#
# For all Unicode collations except the binary (_bin) collations, MySQL performs a table lookup
# to find a characters collating weight.
#
# This weight can be displayed using the WEIGHT_STRING() function.
#
# See SECTION 12.5, "STRING FUNCTIONS"
#
# If a character is not in the table (for example, because it is a "new" character),
# collating weight determination becomes more complex:
#
# 		) For BMP characters in general collations (xxx_general_ci), weight = code point
#
# 		) For BMP characters in UCA collations (for example, xxx_unicode_ci and language-specific collations),
# 			the following algorithm applies:
#
	# 			if (code >= 0x3400 && code <= 0x4DB5)
	# 				base= 0xFB80; /* CJK Ideograph Extension */
	# 			else if (code >= 0x4E00 && code <= 0x9FA5)
	# 				base= 0xFB40; /* CJK Ideograph */
	# 			else
	# 				base= 0xFBC0; /* All other characters */
	# 			aaaa= base + (code >> 15);
	# 			bbbb= (code & 0x7FFF) | 0x8000;
#
# 			The result is a sequence of two collating elements, aaaa followed by bbbb.
#
# 			For example:
#
# 				SELECT HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(_ucs2 0x04CF COLLATE ucs2_unicode_ci));
# 				+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(_ucs2 0x04CF COLLATE ucs2_unicode_ci)) 			  |
# 				+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 				| FBC084CF 																			  |
# 				+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# 			Thus, U+04cf CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER PALOCHKA is, with all UCA 4.0.0 collations,
# 			greater than U+04c0 CYRILLIC LETTER PALOCHKA.
#
# 			With UCA 5.2.0 collations, all palochkas sort together.
#
# 		) FOr supplementary characters in general collations, the weight is the weight for
# 			0xfffd REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.
#
# 			For supplementary characters in UCA 4.0.0 collations, their collating weight
# 			is 0xfffd.
#
# 			That is, to MySQL, all supplementary characters are equal to each other, and greater than
# 			almost all BMP characters.
#
# 			An example with Deseret characters and COUNT(DISTINCT):
#
# 				CREATE TABLE t (s1 VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET utf32 COLLATE utf32_unicode_ci);
# 				INSERT INTO t VALUES (0xfffd); /* REPLACEMENT CHARACTER */
# 				INSERT INTO t VALUES (0x010412); /* DESERET CAPITAL LETTER BEE */
# 				INSERT INTO t VALUES (0x010413); /* DESERET CAPITAL LETTER TEE */
# 				SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s1) FROM t;
#
# 			The result is 2 because the MySQL xxx_unicode_ci collations, the replacement character has
# 			a weight of 0x0dc6, whereas Deseret Bee and Deseret Tee both have a weight of
# 			0xfffd.
#
# 			(Were the utf32_general_ci collation used instead, the result is 1 because all three characters
# 			have a weight of 0xfffd in that collation)
#
# 			An example with cuneiform characters and WEIGHT_STRING():
#
# 				/*
# 				The four characters in the INSERT string are

# 				CREATE TABLE t (s1 CHAR(4) CHARACTER SET utf32 COLLATE utf32_unicode_ci);
# 				INSERT INTO t VALUES (0x000000410001218f000121a700000042);
# 				SELECT HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(s1)) FROM t;
#
# 			The result is:
#
# 				0E33 FFFD FFFD 0E4A
#
# 			0E33 and 0E4A are primary weights as in UCA 4.0.0. FFFD is the weight for KAB and also for KISH.
#
# 			The rule that all supplementary characters are equal to each other is nonoptimal but is not expected
# 			to cause trouble.
#
# 			These characters are very rare, so it is rare that a multi-character string consists entirely of
# 			supplementery characters.
#
# 			In Japan, since the supplementary characters are obscure Kanji ideographs, the typical user
# 			does not care what order they are in.
#
# 			If you really want rows sorted by the MySQL rule and secondarily by code point value:
#
# 				ORDER BY s1 COLLATE utf32_unicode_ci, s1 COLLATE utf32_bin
#
# 		) For supplementary characters based on UCA versions higher than 4.0.0 (for example, xxx_unicode_520_ci),
# 			supplementary characters do not necessarily all have the same collation weight.
#
# 			Some have explicit weights from the UCA allkeys.txt file.
#
# 			Others have weights calculated from this algorithm:
#
# 				aaaa= base + (code >> 15);
# 				bbbb= (code & 0x7FFF) | 0x8000;
#
# There is a difference between "Ordering by the character's code value" and "ordering by the character's binary representation",
# a difference that only appears with utf16_bin, because of surrogates.
#
# Suppose that utf16_bin (the binary collation for utf16) was a binary comparison "byte by byte" rather than
# "character by character".
#
# If that were so, the order of characters in utf16_bin would differ from the order in utf8_bin.
#
# For example, the following chart shows two rare characters.
#
# The first character is in the range E000-FFFF, so it is greater than a surrogate
# but less than a supplementary.
#
# The second character is a supplementary:
#
# 		CODE POINT 		CHARACTER 								UTF8 						UTF16
# 		-------------- --------------- 						----- 					-----
# 		0FF9D 			HALFWIDTH KATAKANA LETTER N 		EF BE 9D 				FF 9D
# 		10384 			UGARITIC LETTER DELTA 				F0 90 BE 84 			D8 00 DF 84
#
# The two characters in the chart are in order by code point values because 0xff9d < 0x10384.
#
# And they are in order by utf8 value because 0xef < 0xf0
#
# But they are not in order by utf16 value, if we use a byte-by-byte comparison, because 0xff > 0xd8
#
# So MySQL's utf16_bin collation is not "byte by byte". It is by "code point".
#
# When MySQL sees a supplementary-character encoding in utf16, it converts the character's code-point value,
# and then compares.
#
# Therefore, utf8_bin and utf16_bin are the same ordering.
#
# THis is consistent with the SQL:2008 standard requirement for a UCS_BASIC collation:
#
# "UCS_BASIC is a collation in which the ordering is determined entirely by the Unicode scalar
# values of the characters in the strings being sorted.
#
# IT is applicable to the UCS character repertoire. Since every character repertoire is a subset
# of the UCS repertoire, the UCS_BASIC collation is potentionally applicable to every character set.
#
# NOTE:
#
# 		The Unicode scalar value of a character is its code point treated as an unsigned integer."
#
# If the character set is ucs2, comparison is byte-by-byte, but ucs2 strings should
# not contain surrogates, anyway.

#
# 10.10.7.1 THE CP932 CHARACTER SET
#
# In MySQL, the sjis character set corresponds to the Shift_JIS character set defined by IANA,
# which supports JIS X0201 and JIS X0208 characters.
#
# However, the meaning of "SHIFT JIS" as a descriptive term has become very vague and it often
# includes the extensions to Shift_JIS that are defined by various vendors.
#
# For example, "SHIFT JIS" used in Japanese Windows environments is a Microsoft extension of
# Shift_JIS and its exact name is Microsoft Windows Codepage : 932 or cp932
#
# IN addition to the characters supported by Shift_JIS, cp932 supports extension characters
# such as NEC special characters, NEC selected - IBM extended characters, and IBM Selected characters.
#
# Many Japanese users have experienced problems using these extension characters.
#
# These problems stem from the following factors:
#
# 		) MySQL automatically converts character sets
#
# 		) Character sets are converted using Unicode (ucs2)
#
# 		) The sjis character set does not support the conversion of these extension characters.
#
# 		) There are several conversion rules from so-called "SHIFT JIS" to Unicode, and some characters
# 			are converted to Unicode differently depending on the conversion rule.
#
# 			MySQL supports only one of these rules (described later)
#
# The MySQL cp932 character set is designed to solve tehse problems.
#
# Because MySQL supports character set conversion, it is important to separate IANA Shift_JIS and cp932
# into two different character sets because they provide different conversion rules.
#
# HOW DOES CP932 DIFFER FROM SJIS
#
# The cp932 character set differs from sjis in the following ways:
#
# 		) cp932 supports NEC special characters, NEC selected - IBM extended characters, and IBM selected characters.
#
# 		) Some cp932 characters have two different code points, both of which converts to the same Unicode code point.
#
# 			When converting from Unicode back to cp932, one of the code points must be selected.
# 			For this "round trip conversion", the rule recommended by Microsoft is used. 
#
# 			The conversion rule works like this:
#
# 				) If the character is in both JIS X 0208 and NEC special characters, use the code point of JIS X 0208
#
# 				) If the character is in both NEC special characters and IBM Selected characters, use the code point of NEC special characters.
#
# 				) If the character is in both IBM selected characters and NEC selected - IBM extended characters,
# 					use the code point of IBM extended characters.
#
# 			The table shown at <link> provides information about the Unicode values of cp932 characters.
#
# 			For cp932 table entries with characters under which a four-digit number appears,
# 			the number represents the corresponding Unicode (ucs2) encoding.
#
# 			For tables entries with an underlined two-digit value appears, there is a range of cp932 char values that
# 			begin with those two digits.
#
# 			Clicking such a table entry takes you to a page that displays the Unicode value for each of the
# 			cp932 character that begin with those digits.
#
# 			The following links are of special interest.
#
# 			They correspond to the encodings for the following sets of characters:
#
# 				) NEC special characters (lead byte 0x87):
#
# 					<link>
#
# 				) NEC selected - IBM extended characters (lead byte 0xED and 0xEE):
#
# 					<link>
# 					<link>
#
# 				) IBM selected characters (lead byte 0xFA, 0xFB, 0xFC):
#
# 					<link>
# 					<link>
# 					<link>
#
# 		) cp932 supports conversion of user-defined characters in combination with eucjpms, and solves
# 			the problems with sjis/ujis conversion.
#
# 			For details, please refer to <link>
#
# For some characters, conversion to and from ucs2 is different for sjis and cp932.
#
# The following tables illustrate these differences.

#
# 10.10.7.2 THE GB18030 CHARACTER SET
#
# In MySQL, the gb18030 character set correspond to the "Chinese National Standard GB 18030-2005: information technology - chinese coded char set",
# which is the official char set of the People's Republic of China (PRC)
#
# Characteristics of the MySQL gb18030 Character Set
#
# 		) Supports all code points defined by the GB 18030-2005 standard.
#
# 			Unassigned code points in the ranges (GB+8431A439, GB+90308130) and
# 			(GB+E3329A36, GB+EF39EF39) are treated as '?' (0x3F).
#
# 			Conversion of unassigned code points return '?'
#
# 		) Supports UPPER and LOWER conversion for all GB18030 code points.
#
# 			Case folding defined by Unicode is also supported (based on CaseFolding-6.3.0.txt)
#
# 		) Supports Conversion of data to and from other character sets.
#
# 		) Supports SQL statements such as SET_NAMES
#
# 		) Supports comparison between gb18030 strings, and between gb18030 strings and strings of other
# 			character sets.
#
# 			There is a conversion if strings have different character sets.
#
# 			Comparisons that include or ignore trailing spaces are also supported.
#
# 		) The private use area (U+E000, U+F8FF) in Unicode is mapped to gb18030.
#
# 		) There is no mapping between (U+D800, U+DFFF) and GB18030.
#
# 			Attempted conversion of code points in this range returns '?'
#
# 		) If an incoming sequence is illegal, an error or warning is returned.
#
# 			If an illegal sequence is used in CONVERT(), an error is returned.
#
# 			Otherwise, a warning is returned.
#
# 		) For consistency with utf8 and utf8mb4, UPPER is not supported for ligatures.
#
# 		) Searches for ligatures also match uppercase ligatures when using the gb18030_unicode_520_ci collation.
#
# 		) If a character has more than one uppercase character, the chosen uppercase character
# 			is the one whose lowercase is the character itself.
#
# 		) The minimum multibyte length is 1 and the maximum is 4.
#
# 			The character set determines the length of a sequence using the first 1 or 2 bytes.
#
# SUPPORTED COLLATIONS
#
# 		) gb18030_bin: A binary collation.
#
# 		) gb18030_chinese_ci: The default collation, which supports Pinyin.
#
# 			SOrting of non-Chinese characters is based on the order of the original sort key.
#
# 			The original sort key is GB(UPPER(ch)) if UPPER(ch) exists.
#
# 			Otherwise, the original sort key is GB(ch). Chinese characters are sorted according to
# 			the Pinyin collation defined in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR 24).
#
# 			Non-Chinese characters are sorted before Chinese characters with the exception of
# 			GB+FE39FE39, which is the code point maximum.
#
# 		) gb18030_unicode_520_ci: A Unicode collation: Use this collation if you need to ensure that ligatures
# 			are sorted correctly.
#
# THE BINARY CHARACTER SET
#
# The binary character set is the character set of bianry strings, which are sequences of bytes.
#
# The binary character set has one collation, also named binary.
#
# Comparison and sorting are based on numeric byte values.
#
# The effect is that lettercase and accent differences are significant in comparisons.
# That is, the binary collation is case-sensitive and accent sensitive.
#

#
# For information about the differences between the binary collation of the binary character set
# and the _bin collations of nonbinary character sets, see SECTION 10.8.5, "THE BINARY COLLATION COMPARED TO _BIN COLLATIONS"
#
# To convert a string expression to a binary string, any of these constructs are equivalent:
#
# 		BINARY expr
# 		CAST(expr AS BINARY)
# 		CONVERT(expr USING BINARY)
#
# If expr is a character string literal, the _binary introducer may be used to designate it as a bianry string.
# For example:
#
# 		_binary 'a'
#
# The _binary introducer is permitted for hexadecimal literals and bit-value literals as well, but uncalled for.
#
# Such literals are binary strings by default.
#
# For more information about introducers, see SECTION 10.3.8, "CHARACTER SET INTRODUCERS"
#
# 10.11 SETTING THE ERROR MESSAGE LANGUAGE
#
# By default, mysqld produces error messages in English, but they can be displayed
# instead in any of several other languages: Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French,
# German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norweigan, Norweigan-ny, Polish,
# Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish or Swedish.
#
# THis applies to messages the server writes to the error log and sends to clients.
#
# To select the language in which the server writes error messages, follow the instructions
# in this section.

# The server searches for the error message file using these rules:
#
# 		) It looks for the file in a directory constructed from two system variable values,
# 			lc_messages_dir and lc_messages, with the latter converted to a language name.
#
# 			Suppose that you start the server using this command:
#
# 				mysqld --lc_messages_dir=/usr/share/mysql --lc_messages=fr_FR
#
# 			in this case, Mysqld maps the locale fr_FR to the language french and looks for the
# 			error file in the /usr/share/mysql/french directory.
#
# 			By default, the language files are located in the share/mysql/LANGUAGE directory under
# 			the MySQL base directory.
#
# 		) If the message file cannot be found in the directory constructed as just described,
# 			the server ignores the lc_messages value and uses only the lc_messages_dir value
# 			as the location in which to look.
#
# 		) If the server cannot find the configured message file, it writes a message to the error log file
# 			to indicate the problem and defaults to built-in English messages.
#
# The lc_messages_dir system variable can be set only at server startup and has only a global
# read-only value at runtime.
#
# lc_messages can be set at server startup and has globlal and session values that can be 
# modified at runtime.
#
# Thus, the error message language can be changed while the server is running, and each
# client can have its own error message language by setting its session lc_messages value
# to the desired locale name.
#
# FOr example, if the server is using the fr_FR locale for error messages,
# a client can execute this statement to receive error messages in English:
#
# 		SET lc_messages = 'en_US';
#
# ADDING A CHARACTER SET
#
# THis section discusses the procedure for adding a character set to MySQL.
# For proper procedure depends on whether the character set is simple or complex:
#
# 		) If the character set does not need special string collating routines for sorting
# 			and does not need multibyte character support, it is simple.
#
# 		) IF the character set needs either of those features, it is complex.
#
# For example, greek and swe7 are simple character sets, whereas big5 and czech are complex.
#
# TO use the following instructions, you must have a MySQL source distrib.
#
# In the instructions, MYSET represents hte name of the char set that you want to add.
#
# 		1. Add a <charset> element for MYSET to the sql/share/charsets/Index.xml file
#
# 			Use the existing contents in the file as a guide to adding new contents.
#
# 			A partial listing for the latin1 <charset> element follows:
#
# 				<charset name="latin1">
# 					<family>Western</family>
# 					<description>cp1252 West European</description>
# 					---
# 					<collation name="latin1_swedish_ci" id="8" order="Finnish, Swedish">
# 						<flag>primary</flag>
# 						<flag>compiled</flag>
#  				</collation>
# 					<collation name="latin1_danish_ci" id="15" order="Danish"/>
# 					---
# 					<collation name="latin1_bin" id="47" order="Binary">
# 						<flag>binary</flag>
# 						<flag>compiled</flag>
# 					</collation>
# 					---
# 				</charset>
